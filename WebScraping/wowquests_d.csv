Danger_Near_and_Far,"We have done all we can about the Jailer for now my friend. There are other matters that require our attention. Like the devourer rifts I recently saw opening to the east! If we do not stop them, those beasts will wreak havoc on this place. Will you help me take care of them, <name>? "
Dangerous_State,Enemies have attacked the Jiro and severed them from the circle. The Jiro are no longer stable. They are a danger to the order of things. They must be removed.

All kyrian undergo this sacred ritual--albeit typically many aeons before they stand before the Archon herself. Soulguide Daelia will guide you in this process. Seek her out in the chamber below. 
Dark_Developments_(Kyrian),"<The torn design document appears to be written by the late Surgeon Stitchflesh.> ...the kyrian flesh improves strength, obedience, and dexterity twofold! Such potential! Now, if subject number one-three-five succeeds in a proper wing transplant at last... <It continues on for some time. You should bring this to Artemede.> "

Dark_Mojo_for_a_Dark_Loa,"How many times must de Necropolis come under attack? I suppose no one ever said worshipping Bwonsamdi would be easy... Bwonsamdi seeks to force Mueh'zala into revealing his secrets, and I must do my part to help. De undead swarming de Necropolis are animated by Mueh'zala's dark mojo.  Bwonsamdi needs some of dat mojo to finish his ritual. Strike down de undead and claim it. "
Daughter_of_the_Night_Warrior,"Find Shandris Feathermoon within Oribos. In my dreams, I see many things. Elven souls tortured in the Maw. A warrior of the night consumed by vengeance. And... Ardenweald's destruction. These visions are ever shifting... ever vague. But I believe Tyrande Whisperwind is key to saving the night elves, as well as this realm. Shandris Feathermoon, Tyrande's daughter, is touched by dreams as well. Even now, she travels to the Eternal City. Find her. If anyone can reach the heart of Tyrande, it is her. "

De-Infiltration,Meet Prince Renathal in Sinfall. Mal'Ganis. It has been many ages since I have said his name. And now I find we must hunt him down. If he has the Medallion of Wrath then there is nowhere he can hide. We can use the other medallions we have recovered to locate him. Join me in Sinfall and bring your dreadlord hunting party. I suspect we will have need of them. 
Dead_Drop,"Ta Repository Retrieve the Prototype Aquilon. Ta'nla requested something very... specific... on behalf of a client. The kyrian have been working on a new type of centurion they call an aquilon. I sent some of our trade specialists to retrieve the prototype in question, but they have yet to return.  Until I have the item, there is obviously no way I can ship it to Ta'nla. Perhaps we can help one another. If you can locate the aquilon and bring it here, I will help you reach Tazavesh. "
Dead_On_Their_Feet,"Dead On Their Feet is a potential quest of the Necrolord Assault on Perdition Hold. Use the Cohesion Crystal to create bodies for 10 Defiant Souls. As the Jailer twists the souls here to his will, there are still some that continue to resist him. I shall give you the ability to aid them in their resistance. Through Necrotic Cohesion we shall bind the runes, armor, and bones that reside here to create bodies for these souls. Bodies that will allow them to fight for us and their freedom! Bind the Zealous souls and build us an army! "
Death_Motes,"Collect Death Motes from Ruin's Cradle. I have a task for you, Maw Walker. Souls deemed suitable for service among the Mawsworn are broken down to their barest essence. The resulting creature forms a black shade, devoid of all individual will. It is a tragic end. I wish to better understand this process--what is it about a soul that causes this transformation? Fragments of broken souls rain down across Ruin's Cradle. Bring me some of them, so that I might learn more about our common adversaries. "
Death_Rains,"With its repeated invasions here, the House of Constructs continues to sully the honor of Maldraxxus. We cannot salvage that honor until justice is done. May we mete it so thoroughly that none will ever attempt this desecration again. Eliminate these traitors with me, <name>. Leave none standing. "
Death%27s_End_Destruction,"It appears we have discovered a common enemy to pursue, <name>. Wherever that necromancer ran off to is no doubt filled with traitors, undead armies from another realm, and at least one lich... It cannot be a sin to kill such as these. To demolish the camp of these invaders and betrayers must be a virtue. A virtue I crave. Let us pursue it with haste. "
Deep_Echo_Trident_(quest),The trident glistens in the sunlight. Give the Deep Echo Trident to Paolone so the soulbinds may use it. 
Deep_Within,"Who... who are you? Have you come to extract more of my memories? I'm afraid there aren't any useful ones left, save for the memories of my imprisonment. Or perhaps you're here for something else? What do you want of me? You could be the key to my freedom. Will you help me, mortal? Speak with the Runecarver again: Who are you? Why are you here? You could be the key to my freedom. Will you help me, Maw Walker? "
Defending_Haven,"The Mawsworn are gathering in force outside our very gates. It is clear they mean to overrun our home! The Enlightened wish only to honor the marvels of the First Ones in peace. Haven's defensive barrier was put in place to shield us from minor threats. We did not imagine the Jailer would send his forces against us. You claim to be our ally, mortal? Then help us defend this sacred land. ... You have proven your mettle, yet the enemy grows bolder. Kill Mawsworn Deadeyes, Mawsworn Chargers, Mawsworn Commanders, Mawsworn Binders, an Anima Seekers. "
Defending_the_Vault,"Help Protector Kah-Rev defeat the invading Mawsworn. To reach the vault, we'll need to carve a path through the attacking Mawsworn. The covenants are doing their best to drive off these monstrosities, but our allies can't hold out forever. The Mawsworn are intent on reaching the prize before you. We could use your help fighting against the Jailer's forces, Maw Walker. Purpose guide us all. "
Delaying_the_Other_Side,Many of Bwonsamdi's worshippers did not make it inside when de undead began swarming de Necropolis. We need a few more of dem to complete Bwonsamdi's ritual to uncover Mueh'zala's plans. Take dis powder and throw it on de worshippers who are stuck outside. It should dispel de dark magic dat afflicts dem. As for de ones who are already dead... dey will serve Bwonsamdi beyond de grave. Dat is all we could ever ask for. 
Descended_(Kyrian)," Slay Woeblade the Atrocity. Though we have stopped the creation of more juggernauts, one of their most vile creations yet draws breath. It was born of one of the most pained souls they took from my temple in Bastion. As I flew above their ranks I could hear their surgeons chanting its name above the din of combat--Woeblade. It is an affront to all the kyrian stand for, an atrocity beyond any other. Mark it with the flames of courage when you engage, and we will help you destroy it. "
Descended_(Necrolord)," Slay Woeblade the Atrocity. Though we have stopped the creation of more juggernauts, one of their most vile creations yet draws breath. It was born of one of the most pained souls they took from my temple in Bastion. As I flew above their ranks I could hear their surgeons chanting its name above the din of combat--Woeblade. It is an affront to all the kyrian stand for, an atrocity beyond any other. Mark it with the flames of courage when you engage, and we will help you destroy it. "
Designed_to_Fail,"The pieces are all coming together. The kyrian, the Paths of the First Ones, and runes of domination?  Kel'Thuzad is looking to breach the Maw! We cannot allow this to happen! The Maw has been locked away from the Shadowlands for good reason. Opening that floodgate could be catastrophic! The baron is too powerful to confront headlong, so we will stop his ritual instead. Return to him with his reagents. I have made some ""modifications"" that should provide a calamitous end to his scheme. "
Destroy_the_Dominant,"Interact with Explosive Animastores, Everburn Lanterns, Emberlight Lanterns, and Sanguine Roses, and kill any mobs in Dominance Keep to fill up the bar. "
Destroying_the_Destructors,"The Mawsworn possess terrible weapons that gather dark magic and hurl it against our gates. The defensive barrier around Haven will not hold much longer. All that we are, all that we hold dear, will soon be erased from existence. If you are who you claim to be, then prove it to us. Destroy the enemy's armaments and help defend our home. I pray to the First Ones that you succeed. ... You have bought us time, mortal. First Ones bless us all. "
Devoured_Anima_(quest),"Devoured Anima is a potential daily quest at Keeper's Respite in Korthia. Reclaim 12 Devoured Anima from devourers in the Estuary of Awakening. Sika has idea! Devourers... devour. They eat anything! So they eat anima, too. If we take anima from devourers, then that anima is ours! "
Digging_Around,"The thin pale ones of Revendreth have been hoarding anima. I've heard they've been hiding it away, digging holes in the woods and just leaving it there. Anyone could come along and take it. I say it should be us! Let's go get some anima. "
Dire_Learning,"Necromancers and liches often use powerful tomes to assist in their rituals. Now that the House of Rituals has expanded their reach, the tomes can be found anywhere where their members are active. Find these books and destroy them. It won't end their vile experiments but it should at least delay them. "
Directing_Dedication,"Redirect anima from the Citadel of Loyalty to the temple. An anima collecto The five temples of Bastion have stood strong since its very creation. The idea of rededicating one has never been broached before, and will no doubt require a significant amount of anima. Underneath this temple are stores of anima we rationed for the drought. Now that anima is returning, we can use these reserves for our purposes. You will need to use channelers and collectors throughout the grounds to redirect anima to the top. That should give me the power I need. "
Discarded_Torments_(quest),<The torn and faded pages depict punishments deemed too lenient and therefore disposed of. Ve'nari may wish to study them.> 
Discerning_Taste,"I have compiled a list of these exclusive guests. Review them at your convenience and inform me who you wish to extend an invitation to first. Fair warning, these discerning individuals will not be easy to please. This quest becomes available after upgrading the Ember Court to rank 4. "
Disloyal_Denizens,"Kill mobs and interact with Kyrian Weapon Racks, Proclamation of Zeal, Proclamation of Pride, Proclamation of Fury, Proclamation of Ambition, and Volatile Animastore. "
Disloyalty,"There are many enemies of Bastion here. If we thin their numbers, it will further mend the tension between our realms. Show no remorse. I will take to the skies to support from above. I will be able to provide ground support when needed. "
Dismantling_the_Opposition,"The Forsworn mobilize! We cannot allow them to march. Attune to Bron, share your power with him. Between the three of us, we shall destroy this new centurion army! "
Disrupting_the_Chain,"From the desk of the Tithelord: All supply carriages must re-route to Stonevigil for collection assistance. Once complete, you may resume your regularly scheduled routes. "
Disrupting_the_Cycle,"The shacklers in the Tremaculum are an awful sort. Souls are tortured there until they turn malevolent. They are then outfitted as guards so the cycle can continue. If you wish to slow the rate at which the Jailer raises his armies, start at the source.  Disrupt the cycle at the Tremaculum. "
Disrupting_the_Flow_(Maw),The tortured embodiment of the soul before you burns with magmatic flame. Whatever purpose it was meant for here in the cauldron has since been served. The complete disregard for the remaining husk of this soul is unsettling. These efforts will continue if something isn't done. Send the inhabitants of Zovaal's Cauldron a message.
Distorted_by_the_Maw,Lysonia's forces are rerouting the anima collectors to spew Maw energy across the temple. They hamper our forces while strengthening their own. The collectors have been tainted. Take Compassion and destroy them to halt Lysonia's boon. 
Diviner%27s_Rune_Chits,"Diviner's Rune Chits starts by looting various Relic Fragment-containing objects in Korthia after completing What Must Be Found. One of them will contain a Pouch of Rune Chits, which begins this quest. Collect 20 rune chits, then bring them to Archivist Roh-Suir in the Reliquary of Remembrance. <Inside the pouch is a single rune chit. It rotates and flips as if moved by an unseen hand. Runes vaguely reminiscent of the Vrykul language are delicately carved into the stone. On the back of the chit is an indication that it is part of a set.> "
Do_Not_Forget,"The Arbiter's judgment was, as always, infallible. Though Alexandros's devotion to the Light is undeniable, it is the memory of his loved ones that truly fuels his strength. He was meant for Maldraxxus, not Bastion. Nonetheless, our reclamation of the temple stands. My vengeance is not yet complete, but now I know that some of the Maldraxxi can still be trusted. Go now. Return to your leader with news of our victory today. And tomorrow, we shall purge our foes once and for all. "
Do_What_We_Cannot,"Rumor has it that you've been to the Maw and back... and that you even made friends with a broker in there!  So many souls destined for Ardenweald are trapped in that dark realm. They need our help... and we need theirs! We can't cultivate the Heart of the Forest's magic without them. I know this is a lot to ask... but you may be our only hope of rescuing them. Please, venture into the Maw and do what we cannot. Ardenweald's future depends on it! "
Doing_the_Dew,"The Thistledrop is magnificent creature. The roots go deep into the earth where they drink of waters most ancient. With these waters they collect the very essence of the land into a drop of dew that enables our artisans to craft powerful armaments. Help us gather the dew and you will be well rewarded. Hurry, before it evaporates! "
Don%27t_Cross_Courage,"We have rendered the enemy holdouts defenseless. My disciples will begin preparations to purge the corruption that your errant kind have left on our home. But more still remain in the inner sanctum of the temple. Their defenses prevent us from flying in en masse, but I can secure a foothold myself. We will cross the breach and annihilate them. "
Doorway_in_the_Dark,"I fear our efforts to stop Zovaal have been thwarted, mortal. A doorway has been opened to a forbidden realm... and the Banished One has reclaimed a power taken from him long ago. I sense your allies returning from the Sanctum of Domination. I must know every detail of what transpired. "

I must know every detail of what transpired. "
Doppelganger_Duel,"Something about this doesn't sit right with me. From what you reported, this seems like intentional sabotage from within our ranks... or the work of more dreadlords.  Either way, the obelisk may be at risk! Get to it--if we linger on this it may be too late! "
Double_Dromans,"Relax, <name>. Breathe. <Dreamweaver inhales and exhales slowly.> Things are getting tense around here, but that doesn't mean YOU need to be tense. Everything is going to be okay. If you don't believe me, let the mighty deeds of Droman Aliothe and Droman Tashmur reassure you. They headed up the hill together to clear a path for the rest of us. They'll have everything taken care of in no time. "
Down_to_Earth,"I can hear the wings of the Mawsworn in the sky up above, taunting us.  But a bird in the hand can be crushed.  Take my spear and prove your aim. Pull a few down and smite them.  Be sure to use the spear. Do not traipse among them so that they will chase you back down to the ground. That's not the point. I want to see you drag them out of the sky. "
Dragonhawk_Soul_(quest),The Dragonhawk Soul is nimble and resilient. The shape of the dragonhawk will be yours to call upon.
Dread_Tidings,"The threat the nathrezim pose to our forces must not be underestimated. They are cunning, rivaling the best veterans of the House of Eyes, and we do not know their full plan. Among the venthyr there is one whose wrath scourged the nathrezim from the Shadowlands for many thousands of years.  I ask you travel to Sinfall, seek out Prince Renathal, and deliver to him this missive. I shall send one of my own spies, the Baroness Vashj, to meet you there. Make use of her experience with the nathrezim. "
Dreadlords!,"Vashj killing a Nathrezim Infiltrato Speak with the Primus in Korthia. This is the fifth dreadlord I have found infiltrating our forces this week. Unchecked they can cause tremendous damage to our foothold here. In life I learned how to identify these creatures from a demon hunter. It makes it far easier for me to locate them, but I cannot be in all places at once. We must report these findings to the Primus. "
Dredgers_Left_Behind,"When Prince Renathal fled Darkwall Tower, he was forced to leave many people and belongings behind. The powerful relics and weapons were long ago carted off to the Master's lair. But the Prince's dredgers were forced to stay and serve the Master's traitorous lackeys here instead. You will be a welcome sight to them--a sign that the Prince has not forgotten them. If they are willing to fight, help them escape and I will ensure they are brought safely to Sinfall. "
Dredging_up_a_Name,"Oi, why aren't you addressing me by my proper name? Wait, I don't remember my name, proper or other. Does this mean I have amnesias? Oh no, I don't have a name, please, help! "
Dredging_up_a_New_Look,If ye look around the muck pool I am sure you will find an armor dye. It might be nice to have the option to dye me belt a different color. 
Dredging_up_an_Assistant,"Here we go, onto the dredging part. Just like we made that biggun here earlier! I mean we don't need the stone of binding or three other dredgers, but you'll still be throwing stuff into the muck! So it's the same. You head to the shore with this here Kaja-Infused Dredger Mix I whipped up for you. Toss it into that muck pool and let's meet that new dredger butler of yours! "
Dressing_the_Kill,"<Huln listens to your explanation, then pauses thoughtfully.> I believe I understand, <name>. But I cannot help you right now. Allow me to explain. In the meantime, will you carve up this carcass with me? Your prey always has something to teach you. "
Drink_to_the_Dead,"The Forsworn are ravaging the temples of Bastion, and the aspirants are leaving behind their supplies as they flee. All those wonderful bottles of nectar falling into the hands of the Forsworn? I think not! There's no way we can save all of the aspirants, but we can keep the Forsworn from taking those supplies. Besides... we could all use something to drink around here. "
Drive_A_Dredge_Between_Them,"Big Shin Kill the 3 large dredgers. First, we ruin their operation. Questions can come later. I scouted from the overlook as we rode in. Necromancers charge crystals full of siphoned anima. Three dredgers stack them onto carts. Kill those dredgers and everything will grind to a halt. "
Droman_Aliothe%27s_Best_Friend,"I have seen many things in my time, <name>. But after so many Ember Courts, I can confidently say that I have not witnessed anything, or anyone, quite like you. You and your prince have asked me to ponder both my purpose and my destiny. I do not know how this adventure that we embark upon will ultimately end, but should I fall, I would hope I shall fall by your side. Call upon me whenever you have need of me. "
Drowned_and_Torn_Asunder,"Free 8 Drowning Kyrian in Gorgoa, the River of Souls. Maw Walker! I am relieved to see you in this place. A dark sect of kyrian who have allied themselves with the Maw stole my brothers and sisters from their posts in Bastion. They turned us over to a foul sea witch, the likes of which I've never seen. This... Helya, I believe they called her... seems determined to break us so that we might also join her ranks. Please, if you can, save my brethren. "
Drum_of_the_Death_Loa,Drum of the Death Loa starts from the Drum of Driving inside the Chamber of Knowledge in Korthia. Gain access to the chamber by using a Teleporter Repair Kit on the Ancient Teleporter at south of the Estuary of Awakening in central Korthia.

"Dude,_Where%27s_My_Necropolis%3F","Maintaining the portal between our sanctum and the Zerekriss is a difficult task. With enough resources, we could make it permanent and become the unstoppable force my baroness wishes us to be. She has asked much of you, as have I.

It is not too late for some of them.
Free the buried souls and stop the endless expansion of suffering. "
Damsels_and_Dragons,"What ho, squire <name>! Forgive my lips, as they bear gravest news. Dragons have taken up stinking residence within the hallowed halls of Blackrock Spire! These great wyrms hold a distressed damsel in their scaly graspers. Her name is Zaela, they say. Such a beautiful name! As my squire, it is your Light-given duty to adventure yourself into this spire and procure evidence of these dragons, lest I waste my heroism on a dragonless quest. Did you find evidence of dragons?

On the last pages you discover a journal: I continue to search for a cure to the curse of Sethe. If Terokk was restored I would not be in this situation. Damn Reshad! I was contacted by an orc that identified himself as Gul'dan. He has a cure for the curse! I must travel to Tanaan to search for the location of this ""cipher"" of his. Take this information to Reshad."

Dark_Grimoire:_The_First_Ingredient,"You will need three ingredients to make Megacharge's special ""Arcane Bunker Buster,"" which should be able to take down the barrier. The first ingredient, some precision blasting powder, should be available nearby. The book reads: ""To make one, you'll first need to acquire some high grade, precision blasting powder. Here in Blackfuse Company, it's pretty easy to come by, since they use it for all of the cannons."" "
Dark_Grimoire:_The_Second_Ingredient,"With the blasting powder acquired, you now must find a suitable detonator.

Death_to_Hivelord_Ik%27rix!,"We've got a radical new idea to try using ice ravager carapaces in our tempering process for armor and weapons. It's the sort of trailblazing work we strive for, commander! Only problem is, ravagers apparently aren't keen on our guys and gals taking their carapaces off of them. There's this particular ravager at the Southwind Cliffs in Frostfire Ridge called Hivelord Ik'rix - if you could take him down we wouldn't need more for weeks! "

We've been contracting out some spy work to the local fisherman - we pay 'em some coin, they take their boats out north of Umbrafen and see what the Iron Horde's up to.  Win-win, right? Well, it turns out... no.  Every boat that goes out never comes back.  Apparently this giant water elemental, Undertow I think it was, is murdering the snot out of everyone that passes through. Any chance you could clear it out for us, commander? "

Demonslayer_of_Tanaan,"Slay 20 demons in Tanaan Jungle. Demons!  Hate 'em! Gul'dan is spinning up more summoning portals with each passing hour.  There's only one way to stem the tide, <name>. <Parvink smashes her gauntleted fist against her open palm.> Smash 'em! The Temple of Sha'naar is a good place to start, or head up to the Throne of Kil'jaeden if you're looking for a real challenge. <Parvink looks at some hatch marks she scribbled on a scrap of paper.> I'm up to 17 demons killed today.

Gul'dan's summoning portals are not yet at full strength, but already the stench of demon is on the wind. Slay them, <name>. Destroy as many beasts as you can before they find a way to Azeroth. The Temple of Sha'naar is infested, as is the Throne of Kil'jaeden, although you may find others wandering about jungle. How does it feel, <name>? To look the Burning Legion directly in the eye and to tell them... ""Not today."" "

Derailment,"Several orcs have spoken out since Gul'dan assumed control. Some were taken prisoner. Among them is an engineering prodigy: Solog Roark, ""The Iron Shipwright.""

We confirmed that Solog Roark is aboard this prison train, but it's locked up tight. Oh - you brought explosives? Hmph. Those goblin friends of yours are always prepared. Let's bust this box open and convince that shipwright to join our cause... "
