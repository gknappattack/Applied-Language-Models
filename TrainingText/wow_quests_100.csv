0_Champions of Azeroth_Assist Magni by completing 4 Azerite world quests.
1_The Heart of Azeroth_Our world's dyin', <name>. Sargeras's sword has cut deep. Her pain is drivin' the elements into a frenzy!

I can hear Azeroth's voice, but she needs more than her speaker.

She needs her champion.

Far below us lies an ancient titan vault called the Chamber of Heart. I sense she wishes tae speak tae ye there.

Come with me into the chamber. It may be our only chance tae save her!
2_Delegation_I am duty-bound to look into your claims immediately, <race>, which means my mission here now must fall to you.A surge of ancient magic, far too strong to have occurred naturally, drew me here. I have since discovered a most troubling development.A bough from Nordrassil has been ripped from the tree and taken deep into the Firelands. There, a powerful ritual threatens to corrupt Nordrassil, consuming it in flame.You must find a way to interrupt the ritual and reclaim the World Tree's branch.
3_They Grow Up So Fast_I think this little fellow will be a good match for you.This cub is going to require a lot of attention to ensure that he grows up strong and healthy. You should check up on your cub at least once each day. Feeding and caring for your Winterspring cub is the best way to build a bond of trust with him.As your cub grows, he will shed his old whiskers and grow new ones appropriate to his size. Once your cub has shed twenty whiskers, bring him back to me along with some materials for your saddle.
4_Legion: The Legion Returns_Heroes of the Alliance, I write to you in Azeroth's darkest hour. From the maw of hell, the burning armies of the Legion have returned.

Our fleets depart for the Broken Isles at once. As a grand lance, we will pierce the Legion's lines and drive them back to the nether that spawned them.

Your ship awaits in the Stormwind Harbor, make haste.
5_A Dying World_Champion. Magni Bronzebeard needs your help.

Azeroth is dying. Before this war, a massive demon called Sargeras stabbed the planet with a sword.

Our planet cries out in pain while the Horde and Alliance fight amongst each other.

Magni Bronzebeard believes you can help heal the planet's wounds.

Meet him in Silithus. He has set up camp where Sargeras's sword impacted our world.
6_The Art of War_Lok'tar Ogar, old friend. It has been too long since last we spoke.It is good to see that you emerged safely from the depths of Vashj'ir.I am stationed here in Grommash Hold.All in service to the Horde are to swear allegiance to their new Warchief.You would do well not to keep him waiting, <name>.
7_Toxic Tolerance_You want to ride a Venomhide? Then I've got bad news for you.The Venomhide Ravasaurs, they're all poison: Poison blood, poison spit, poison skin. You climb on one, you fall off dead in a few hours.You'd have to build up a resistance to their toxins before I sold you one, and that takes a long, LONG time... you'd need to be splashed with poisonous blood while fighting one numerous times. If you're really interested, the venomhides prefer the northern area of the Marshlands, northwest of here.
8_Battle for Azeroth: Mission Statement_The warchief has requested to meet with you in person.

Lady Sylvanas was impressed with the prowess and courage you displayed during our mission to Exile's Reach. 

Now that you've arrived, I will make the introduction.
9_The Ritual Bond_I will tend to Grimclaw until his rest is done - he will be ready to return very soon. I have one more task for you while we wait... a favor to grant you, really, should you recognize it.The great wildlife spirits roam around us waiting and hoping for someone that will aid in stopping the destruction. They are with us as we speak even now, and with the materials  you brought me, I can grant you sight. Speak to these spirits, choose one, and return to me with their blessing.
10_Hero's Call: Mount Hyjal!_By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Emissary Windsong at Nighthaven in Moonglade.Our brothers in the Cenarion Circle report that Deathwing's minions have launched a destructive offensive against the world tree and threaten to burn it to the ground!Speak with Cenarion Emissary Jademoon in Stormwind Keep to gain entry into Moonglade.For the glory and honor of the Alliance! Fight on, <brother/sister>!
11_Battle for Azeroth: Hour of Reckoning_Champions of the Alliance, 

At last the time has come for us to reclaim what is rightfully ours! Our final push to retake Lordaeron Keep shall commence at dawn. 

The Horde and their Warchief must answer for their crimes!
12_Machines of War_Far to the east the "Worldbreakers" lay hidden in the Twilight Highlands. We must end their threat and we will do it with the most powerful army ever!

Our new allies, the goblins, are making us new machines of war but I hear that there are problems with the quality. We can't fight with broken war machines. Speak to Foreman Glibbs and make sure our machines are ready for battle.
13_Security!_It's not as like I haven't got enough to think about here!Keeping this place operational is hard enough without constant elf and draenei harassment.Now, on top of everything, there's an assassin lurking around the camp who's killed an important diplomat... on my watch!Whoever it is couldn't have gotten far, <class>. Scour the camp until you find her and then avenge the diplomat!At least I can bring the assassin's head with me when I have to answer to Hellscream.
14_Just a Fancy Cockroach_Evidently, the ancient statues were home to various species of scarab.Determined to leave this site in the best condition possible, you resolve to ridding the chamber of these pests.
15_Light Camera Action_Oh, hi! Isn't this a great shot? I love my S.E.L.F.I.E. camera!

Do you want me to make you one, too? I only need a few parts!

For the strap, I'll need a Russet Belt from one of the armor merchants in Stormwind.

I've already ordered more housings, you're welcome to take one, you just have to find where my shipment ended up!

Oh, and a Standard Scope, most any engineer can make you one of those.

Ok, are you ready for a little photography action?!
16_The Battle for Lordaeron_King Wrynn has mustered our forces, <name>. We mean to launch a full-scale assault on Lordaeron.

We'll drive the Horde from the keep and reclaim it for the Alliance. It's been far too long since our flag flew in Tirisfal.

Ready to ship out? Captain Angelica here will see to your transport.
17_Elementary!_<You can't read the text, but diagrams seem to indicate that the devices around you should be activated in a set order.><One passage of the Apocrypha has been translated to modern text:>   In the beginning was shadow eternal.   Hate blazed forth, and FIRE was born.   Wounds scabbed, and so begat EARTH.   Cries of anguish birthed howling WIND.   Wherein the skies wept seas of TEARS.      We live in the shadow,      The world we know   Built of rage, hurt, anguish and sorrow.
18_The Grimtotem Weapon_During the last Grimtotem attack, I was wounded, but not before I managed to capture a curious totem our enemies were using against us.It seemed to be emitting raw bolts of energy during the battle, but in all my experiments, I haven't managed to figure out how it works. I'll loan the totem to you if you agree to help me test it.The watery areas surrounding the farm are home to pesky mottled drywallow crocolisks and drywallow daggermaws. Try fighting the crocolisks near the totem.
19_The Hopeless Ones..._On a ledge of the reef, deeper than where you found the bloodcursed naga, you will find the hopeless ones: The bloodcursed voyagers, ghosts of those taken by the bloodcurse.It is regrettable, what I ask of you now... but they must be destroyed and their cursed shells brought back to me.Their souls must be put to rest. Return to me when you have done as asked and I shall give you one final task.
20_Supplies from the Uldum Accord_The Uldum Accord appreciates all the help you've given us.

Please take these supplies as a token of our gratitude, and a promise of more to come, should you continue to help us.
21_Fel To Pieces_The infernals that lurk in Shatter Scar Vale are formidable, but not invincible. Much progress has been made in thinning their numbers.Destroying them is only part of the solution, however. I've found that the stone that infernals are made of still contains large amounts of fel magic even after the infernal's death.The rubble of slain infernals now litters Shatter Scar Vale, leeching its corruption back into the ground. If you could collect it and bring it to me, I would be grateful.
22_Stalling the Survey_These maps have all been drawn by the same steady hand. I've seen a human surveyor heading up and down the road between the hold and the jungle to the east.We can set their plans back by making an example out of this surveyor, <name>.<Kilrok points to the signature at the bottom of the maps.>What do you think that says? "Zykes?" Even human names sound thin and weak. Kill him.
23_My Own Drone_The saddle is complete. I can't say I enjoyed working with that corrupted metal, but in the end I can easily say this is the finest saddle I have ever crafted.

I know it looks... aggressive, but I assure you that your aqir will find it quite comfortable.

I hope it serves you well.
24_Warchief's Command: Mount Hyjal!_All able-bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Emissary Windsong at Nighthaven in Moonglade.Our brothers in the Cenarion Circle report that Deathwing's minions have launched a destructive offensive against the world tree and threaten to burn it to the ground!Speak with Cenarion Emissary Blackhoof to gain entry into Moonglade. Blackhoof is located at the tauren district in the Valley of Wisdom in Orgrimmar.Onward, <brother/sister>! Destiny calls!
25_Adventurers Wanted: Chromie's Call_Chromie is seeking veteran adventurers to embark on expeditions through time and space.This is your opportunity to experience the legendary adventures of the past--today!Speak with Chromie near the Stormwind Embassy for more information.
26_Farewell, Minnow_Thank you, little one.Sometimes it's easy to get lost in the throes of love and lose sight of things, even as a dragon. I plan to rededicate myself entirely to making sure Kalec never steps up to take Malygos' place. It's the most noble cause I can think of.You should head back to the harbor. I believe someone's waiting for you there.Try not to get squashed or eaten by anything.
27_The Stormwind Extraction_My lady is shrewd indeed. If we are to infiltrate Stormwind City, we will need the very best the Horde has to offer, and yet a team so small as to be able to infiltrate the heart of Alliance territory unseen.

<Nathanos peers at the gathered group, stroking his chin.>

Yes, I see.

The path ahead is clear. Speak to me when you are ready to undertake the Warchief's mission, <name>.
28_Proving Pit_Ya done quite well for ya'self, <class>. I'm sure I could teach ya a trick or two here and dere, but I not be wastin' ya time on tiki targets no longer.l put one last trial before ya den, mon. Head over to da provin' pit in the middle of dis area and fight a real baddy - one dat wants ta kill ya back. Just let the jailor by the pit know when ya ready.
29_Down From the Sky_The archers of Ramkahen are highly skilled, but the bows of the Amathet have the advantage of range. This makes our incursions into their territory highly dangerous.

You have a knack for fighting behind enemy lines. If you could thin out their ranks, it could provide us an opportunity to push their lines back for once.

Will you help?
30_Rider on the Storm_You cannot help but to feel a twinge of pride, having unlocked this long lost secret of the ancient worshippers of Elune.You now possess the power to inflict great damage upon your enemy.As it was Furien's tireless work that made this possible, it only seems right that the weapon should be unleashed upon those who took his life.The Alliance scum at Nijel's Point shall pay for their offenses against the Horde!
31_Open Their Eyes_Before you go...I've taken advantage of my "alone time" with Impsy here to learn some interesting facts about imps. Specifically, he ended up telling me the one thing that all imps fear most. Something they're absolutely terrified of.I thought that sounded useful as well as interesting, so I've done some basic conjuring. This prism will project an image of... well, of what Impsy described.Shadowlurk Ridge is still swarming with imps. Why don't you go test their reaction for me?
32_The Eye of the Storm_Greetings, hero of Azeroth.We of the Earthen Ring know you by name, <name>.Your exploits and accomplishments are many. Azeroth already stands in your debt, and yet again she is in need of her heroes.I am but a messenger. A powerful presence seeks audience with you.Peer into the Waters of Farseeing and behold the dilemma of our world.
33_All Aboard!_You hear all of that, <name>? There are Alliance that need killing and I need to round up a veteran crew.You're coming with me!We won't be returning until our assignment's complete, so round up your things and make ready.I'll be aboard a newly commissioned gunship over Bladefist Bay.Don't keep me waiting!
34_Corrosion Prevention_Just look at this area! It's swarming with oozes. If I don't find some way to keep them under control, they'll corrode the wreckage and the zeppelin's cargo!I can't go back empty-handed, <class>! Help me dissolve these oozes before they've digested everything!This device, when powered, will concentrate energy on the slimes, causing them to explode. The zeppelin's fragmented power core should power the device. The one near the main crash works all the time, but the others flicker on and off.
35_A Legendary Engagement_I expected that I would find you here, <class>. But then, we of the bronze flight have somewhat of an advantage when it comes to such things.<Coridormi smiles.>For reasons unknown to me, my master seeks audience with you.I would counsel you not to take this invitation lightly, <name>. Anachronos seldom has cause to interact with mortals. Wisdom would dictate that you seek him out in the Caverns of Time at once.Speak to me when you are ready and I shall personally deliver you.
36_Due Reward_You have served me well these past few minutes we've spent together - minutes I shall not soon forget.I believe a reward befitting your unwavering loyalty is in order. You will have the distinct honor of placing Twinkles' favorite toy by his grave in honor of his memory.Please, please - save your thanks for Twinkles; it is not every day that we may honor a horse made of STARS.
37_Aessina's Miracle_<The finger-like branches of one of Nordu's burning limbs part, revealing an untouched, glimmering seed.>This is the Heart of the Forest. The seed of life.Take this to your Arch Druid at Aessina's Grove - Hamuul Runetotem will know how to invoke its power. I promise you, the wilderness spirit will be silent no longer. New life will bloom from the ashes of old.Thank you, <race>. My time is done.
38_Weapons of Mass Dysfunction_<Glibbs mops sweat from his brow with a greasy handkerchief.>Saurfang isn't happy with our work? This is very bad. My boys need to step it up.Maybe you can help set an example. A set of Hellscream Demolishers just rolled off the blocks and are ready for inspection. Give them a thorough going-over, and if you find any problems, give the Chief Engineer a good thrashing. Remind them that the Horde is depending upon them!
39_Learn to Ride in Darnassus_This pamphlet advertising riding training and mount purchases was sent from Jartsam.Jartsam can be found at the Cenarion Enclave in Darnassus.
40_While You're Here_The Maraudine have raided the Gelkis camps for many years, stealing anything they could get their hands on.One of their favorite torments is to take these relics of power which the Gelkis hold sacred, and bring them here to be defiled.The Gelkis clan would certainly be grateful if you were to find and destroy these defiled artifacts.
41_Your Time Has Come_<A pleasant image fills your mind's eye as a calm voice echoes through your being.>Young <class>, be still and hear my words.I am called to collect you, to deliver you, to one whose eye none can escape.Find me in Stormwind, mortal, for your time has come.
42_Touch the Untouchable_I've added a drop of my very own essence to the ooze. Look for a glowing sigil to the west, at the edge of Shadowlurk Ridge. Stand on it, concentrate, and pour this stuff all over yourself. It should be enough to shift you into the nether and let you see what's REALLY there.You won't be alone... the satyr's treasure is being guarded by the biggest voidstalker they could summon. Defeat him, and the treasure is yours.And come back in one piece, or this crazy broad's gonna fry me!
43_Druid of the Claw_After examining this charm, <name>, I see now what must be done. Please take it, and do as I ask.You are to approach the door to the nearby chamber. Inside, you will find my soulless body... Although I regret what I am about to tell you, I see no other way to free myself from the control of the Gnarlpine.In order for me to escape them, you must kill my physical form.  Once that is done, use the voodoo charm on my fallen body. After you have completed this task, please return to me.
44_Find OOX-17/TN!_You have uncovered some sort of strange, egg-shaped device made from metal.  Fiddling with one of its knobs springs the egg to life, as it opens up into some sort of gnomish robotic contraption!  A voice from inside the robotic egg crackles to life."The name's Oglethorpe, and my homing robot has gone missing!  I will reward you for its recovery!  Please take this beacon to the robot.  Excellent, I now have computed the coordinates for you!  It crashed near the Gaping Chasm in Tanaris!"
45_Dahlia's Tears_In this dark time, I'll not be the one to abandon a champion of the Light.We will need something sacred for this to have a hope of saving your Bridenbrad... a remnant of a devout being that fell victim to this very same plague.Go now to the sacred soil of the passages outside my Ruby Dragonshrine where the battle is joined. As my Ruby Keepers fly down and set flame to the ground beneath undead feet, you will witness new life grow forth. Among that life are Dahlia's Tears - bring them to me.
46_The Bears Up There_Do not fear the bears in this grove, <class> - I have pacified them for the moment.My concern at present is for the welfare of the bear cubs. The fires drove the little ones up the trees, where they've gotten stuck. We've got to get those bears safely to the ground!Flying creatures frighten them, so you'll have to climb the trees yourself. Look for footholds at the trunks. Climb the trees, grab the bear cubs, and toss them - GENTLY! - onto the target here.Nothing can go wrong with this plan.
47_The Offering to Azshara_The warlord said the horn of the ancients was being offered to Azshara above Nazj'vel.Perhaps it's not too late to save the ancient relic from being destroyed.
48_Protect the World Tree_<Ysera's eyes look distant, as if not fully acknowledging you.>I feel it as well, <class>. Ragnaros has arrived.We must defeat his minions before he can join them and lend them his strength.Seek Malfurion Stormrage at the Tranquil Grove, west of here, and aid his forces in any way you can.I must seek answers from within the Emerald Dream.  You must protect the World Tree until I return.
49_Traitors!_Please, stranger.  You must help me.I came here to investigate the arrival of a powerful ally to the Neferset, only to be betrayed by my closest allies and given up to the enemy.Go to the terrace above us to the east and find the information I failed to uncover.  You'll need to hide from the Neferset.  Perhaps you can hide behind one of the large plants on the platform to conceal your presence.Do this for me and I will help your friends find their way to safety.
50_Finding Your Way_Stormwind has a lot to offer adventurers like us, but it's far too big to explore on foot. The captain has arranged for you to receive a mount to help you get around.

She said to speak with Curly at the stables in Old Town... but I can't seem to remember the way there.

Have no worries, <name>! All we need to do is ask a guard for directions. If you ever need help finding something, the city guards will show you where to go.

Let's ask a nearby guard for directions to the stable master in Old Town!
51_Gurtar's Request_I have a bit of a personal request for you, <class>.It has been many moons since I have seen my love, Draaka. It will be many more before we are able to be together again. I fear that as time passes, her love for me will wane.This braid has special meaning to the two of us, as do Thorned Bloodcups, the flower of this region.I ask that you pluck the flowers and weave them into this twine, then present the gift to Draaka on my behalf.
52_The Root of All Evil_<name>, thanks to you we have devised a way to summon forth the root of all evil for the Winterfall tribe - the corrupting demon that dominates them!Take this torch to the mouth of Grolnar's personal cave and plant it there.  Doing so will force the demon to reveal itself and investigate.  This is when you and your allies must strike it down!  Only the essence of the fallen demon will begin the lengthy healing process of the Winterfall tribe... and the salvation of Timbermaw Hold.
53_Echeyakee_Whitemist, or 'Echeyakee' in the tauren tongue, is the king of the savannah cats. He hunts with such stealth, they say he's like a thin, white mist on the earth. He kills so fast his prey have no time for fear or pain.The tauren say he is both mercy and death.<name>, I now set you on the path to hunt Echeyakee. His lair is just northwest of here, on the north side of a small mountain, among the bones of giant Kodo.Go. Blow this horn when you reach his lair. Blow the horn, and he will come.
54_Banner of the Stonemaul_When the dragons came and took over Brogg's old home, Stonemaul ogres fled and left everything behind, including clan's banner.Brogg knows banner was kept deep in Stonemaul ogre mound, but these days it's called Den of Flame. Brogg must have clan banner to get his revenge on dragons who killed his friends.Brogg's clan's old mound, Den of Flame, is northwest of Mudsprocket and crawling with dragonkin. Banner will be deep inside the cave. Be careful, <name>.
55_The Ancient Brazier_What do we have here? A <race>? Come to steal our land with your honeyed tongue and promises?You do not fool me. I have lived a long time, and I know what dealing with your kind means. But the khans do not listen to their elders like they used to.Since you are here, I will put you to use. When the waters rushed in, the great water spirit, Aquarian, doused the Ancient Brazier deep inside of Splithoof Hold.Use this brand to reignite the brazier. Aquarian is sure to come. Bring me the Sacred Flame.
56_Secondhand Diving Gear_There's plenty of wreckage strewn across the bottom of the water from here to Alcaz, and the Defias have already got divers out there looking around. With the help of some of their gear, we can get you suited up and ready to join the hunt, but you'll have to do some creative "borrowing" first.Search this island for a crate of diving gear and something to repair it with. When you've got them, bring them to me and I'll have your gear ready in no time!
57_Hero's Call: Uldum!_By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Adarrah at Thistleshrub Valley in Tanaris.Be one of the first to enter glorious Uldum and claim its treasures in honor of the Alliance!You can reach Adarrah's caravan by traveling to the western reaches of Tanaris.For the glory and honor of the Alliance!
58_Walking the Dog_Hmmmphh.... it seems they'll let anyone in these days.Very well.  You doubtlessly became acquainted with Smolderos in the proving grounds.Well, I've been entrusted with the care of one of his pups.  Quite the little terror -- if he grows up to be anything like his father he shall serve our cause well.Collect meat from the basilisks around the area and feed them to him.
59_To Be Prepared_Allies from across Azeroth have come to Stormwind to support our efforts against the Burning Legion.

Before you ship out, you should pay them a visit. Every bit of preparation helps!
60_Azsharite Experiment Number One_Well, I can think of one surefire way to send a giant running to the bathroom, but you're not going to like it. What we need is a ... massive ... laxative. Oh hey! Would you believe the gnomes have something of the sort? That can't be a coincidence. I wonder what they're trying to push through over there?Our intelligence reports that the laxative was delivered to Gadgetspring's tower, down on the shoreline south of the Secret Lab. Retrieve that laxative and feed it to Gormungan!
61_Void Incubation_Well one thing is for certain with this egg, it requires great amounts of void energy in order to thrive. 

It is fortunate for us that an Old God is attacking Azeroth at this very moment, yes?

No? Oh...

In any case, there should be an abundance of void energy wherever N'Zoth's minions strike. You should head out and find some.
62_Recover the Cargo!_Well, I was able to make enough repairs to this gear to let you dive for awhile, anyway. I wouldn't count on it holding out for a long time, though.The wreckage of the ship is strewn along the bottom from the east coast of this island out toward Alcaz Island. While that helm holds out, locate pieces of the wreckage on the bottom between this island and Alcaz. Use this salvage kit to search the wreckage for pieces of the cargo. Be careful not to venture too close to Alcaz Island. Those hydra are fierce.
63_Counterattack!_The Horde commends your successes against the Kolkar, but the Kolkar themselves are maddened.  I have reports that a contingent of Kolkar has traveled to the Barrens from their home in Desolace, to seek vengeance.  My latest report was that, even now, they move against these bunkers, from the west!Face the Kolkar invaders, and end their threat in the Barrens.  Kill them until their leader, Warlord Krom'zar, appears.  Defeat him and bring me a piece of his banner as proof.We're counting on you, <name>.
64_Maatparm Mushroom Menagerie_Did you know mushroom hunting is far more dangerous than mushroom consumption? Mushroom hunters expose themselves to many unknowns - not including potential wildlife dangers!What would life be without a little danger? I am in need of mushrooms for my collection. Scattered throughout these unexplored wilds you will find four different types: An aquatic stinkhorn, a blood mushroom, a ruinous polyspore, and a fel cone fungus. They are each unique to various regions in Bloodmyst. Bring them to me.
65_Dread Head Redemption_I sense that Durak is more than he seems. Demonic power is dangerous and it is easy to fall to its corruption - even for a trained warlock. 

I do not trust him, <name>.

Find this Durak and tell him that the Horde will have nothing to do with him.
66_Unfamiliar Waters_The Warchief has designs to launch an all-out assault on the Twilight Highlands. Once there we hope to ally with the Dragonmaw orcs.Through my own sources I've discovered that a Dragonmaw orc resides here, in Orgrimmar. He is known as Herezegor Flametusk, and once he commanded legions of their warriors.His insider knowledge is precious to us. Find Flametusk and obtain for us a chart of the Twilight Highlands waterways.Last I hear, Flametusk was washed up at a bar in the Valley of Honor...
67_Keep Your Friends Close_The Legion is bold indeed to strike at the Horde's stronghold! You aided our defense, but now I have a more important task for you.It seems the demon hunters will play a crucial part in this war... but I still don't trust them. You will be my envoy to the Illidari. Learn what they know. Study their techniques. If they betray us, we'll use their own knowledge against them.Their camp lies atop the plateau in the city. Go. Nathanos and I will clean up this mess.
68_Learn to Ride at the Exodar_This pamphlet advertising riding training and mount purchases was sent from Aalun.Aalun can be found at the entrance to the Exodar on Azuremyst Isle.
69_A Prayer and a Wing_A winged visage? Could it be...?<name>, there's no time to waste. You may have been speaking to Aviana herself, trying to return to us.I'll need something from Aviana's past to reach out to her. High atop the ridge overlooking this shrine, you'll find a series of huge nests belonging to Blaithe, an ancient bird of prey that was once her consort. For ten thousand years he's been mad with grief.Go to one of his roosts, and use this call to summon him. Kill Blaithe and bring me one of his feathers.
70_Twilight Skies_I just got word from Orgrimmar that the Warchief wants us to move out. We wouldn't have been ready if it wasn't for your help!The plan is for the air fleet to take off immediately, and for the navy to follow close behind. Hellscream will be accompanying the air fleet and specifically requested that you come along with us.No time to delay! Go to the Southern Rocketway Terminus here in Azshara, and check in with Friz Groundspin. I'll bring the zeppelin around to pick you up.
71_To the Rescue!_You're coming with me, <name>.There's no one else that I can spare, and we cannot afford for Splintertree to be lost.Prepare yourself, and speak to me again when you are ready.
72_Feegly the Exiled_Saddest story I ever heard told, <name>. Feegly was one of our fastest diggers, until he got a hold of that - thing. "The Tear of the Moons" we called it. It changed him. Remade him. I wish it had stayed buried.Feegly was banished from Bael Modan but I've heard reports he's come sniffing around the dig site again. He's suffered enough, the wretched thing. If you find him down there, put ol' Feegly out of his misery.
73_Nat's Bargain_So you found a copy of Dastardly Denizens of the Deep, did you? Well, I can tell you from experience, it's all true. I've even seen a few of 'em with my own eyes.But you want to know about Tethyr.  I said I'd make you a deal, so here's what I want you to do. I'm working on a new line of baits, but I haven't tested this one yet.Just take this paste -- yeah, it smells a little foul -- smear it on yourself, and swim into the deep part of Tidefury Cove to the southwest. Let me know how it works!
74_True Power of the Rod_Now, take the rod and while using its power, speak with my brother, Ota Wen.Ota is amongst the other furbolg that the orcs have captured and have penned in the giant cage on the north side of Silverwind Refuge. The rod will allow you to convince Ota and the other furbolg to rise up and attack the Horde.Then you may go wherever your path leads you. Just know that you have found a new friend for that which you have done.
75_The Trial of Fire_The Trial of Fire... oooh... sounds intimidating, doesn't it? No? Hm. Well I kind of thought so. Firsts are first, you touch the fire crystal and the portal to the trial opens.To beat this trial, you have to hop around in the fire runes without getting hit by the fire. If you stay unflamed long enough, you win!There are little signs to help you - fire hopping to its new rune, fizzles when a rune goes cold. You can figure that stuff out if you want. Or just guess! That's what most people do.
76_The Theramore Docks_<name>, two of our spies were sent to steal documents from a ship at the Theramore docks.  They gained the papers but were discovered, and were forced to throw the documents into the sea.One spy later escaped, but was unable to recover the prize.  He reported his failure to me, and I now charge the task to you.The documents are in a footlocker, in the waters somewhere beneath the Theramore docks.  Find those documents, <name>, and bring them to me.
77_Big Bad Beetle_It could do our hatchling some good to face off against another aqir, to learn what his kind are capable of.

I have found an opponent who could provide a challenging fight.
78_Escape From the Lost City_Everything is ready!  Undo my chains and set your friends free.We must move quickly before the Neferset scum realize we're up to something!If we make it, see my brother, King Phaoris for a reward.
79_Easy Money_Well, hello there!Whatever brought you, I'm so glad that you're here! My friends will never admit to it, but we could really use a hand.The ancient region of Uldum has been exposed! Treasures beyond your wildest dreams, free for the taking!We just need a bit of an escort, what with the bandits and all...You'll accompany us, won't you?You're welcome to all the loot you can haul off!
80_The Battle for Darkshore_The ancients of the grove have come to our aid, <name>.  I can see through their eyes even as we speak.The Twilight's Hammer has been forced to hasten their ritual and have thus only managed to resurrect but a remnant of dread Soggoth.Destroy it before it's too late, <name>.  I am needed elsewhere.Return to the druids at the Grove of the Ancients when it is all over they will direct you further.
81_A Great Idea_Now that we've got a good pile of fresh chunks, we just tie it to this rope...and now you're ready to go catch me a silithid.What? Don't give me that look, it's perfectly safe. Well, mostly safe. Okay, you might die painfully. But it'll be easy! Just throw this meat out there, wait for a bug to pounce on it, and then drag 'em back here by the rope!Go after one of the swarmers. I haven't seen the other ones go for hyenas before, and you should find plenty of swarmers around the edge of the pit.
82_Vorsha the Lasher_Vorsha the Lasher... the fiendish hydra that roams the seas...She has attacked our outpost, each time unprovoked, laying waste to anything that falls in her path.But I am ready, <name>. I have prepared to best the hydra and end these attacks on Zoram'gar.The naga honor the wicked nature of this beast with a brazier that remains lit on an island just off the coast. I believe that if we put it out, Vorsha will appear in anger.We will need help, so be sure to bring some strong allies.
83_Making Amends_
84_Get Them While They're Young_I can teach you to ride a Winterspring frostsaber, but it takes time and dedication. For this to work, both saber and rider must be highly trained and both must share a bond of deep trust.The cubs are only receptive to this training if they're introduced to their riders at a young age. Some of the cubs in the dens surrounding Frostsaber Rock are at the proper age to begin their training. If you help me gather the most promising of those cubs, I'll allow you to begin training with your own cub.
85_The Last Wave of Survivors_It's too late for Laird, he didn't make it in time.The last wave of night elves from Auberdine attempted to escape a couple of hours ago. They stayed in their old home, clinging to the hope that it could be salvaged, but it seems they were finally forced out. I fear many of them won't make it, like Laird did not.Quickly, go down the coast to the west and find any survivors that you can. We're sending Sentinels and Hippogryphs down, but every moment counts - we need to know which ones might make it.
86_A Prisoner of Interest_The Twilight's Hammer wants to free Fandral Staghelm?Malfurion suspected his corruption ran deep... this just cements it.At any rate we cannot allow our enemies to get their hands on such a powerful arch druid.I've a plan, <name>.  We will move the prisoner through the Emerald Dream.  It will be risky, but with all the cultists present here it might be the only way to guarantee our success.Speak to Saynna Stormrunner inside the Barrow Dens to the northeast.
87_The Grimtotem Plot_With the activities of the Grimtotems in Thousand Needles brought to light, many tauren now regard them with suspicion.  We've seen high-ranking Grimtotems engage in murder and kidnapping to advance their interests and I fear we may become their next target.Blackhoof Village, to the northeast, near Bluefen, is a large new Grimtotem settlement. Their leaders, the elders, will all have orders from Thunder Bluff. See if you can capture the orders and piece them together to learn the Grimtotems' plans.
88_King of the Foulweald_My research has paid off.I believe that with a show of force, we can diminish the furbolgs' aggressiveness.Take this banner a short ways northeast and place it on their totem mound. They will try to destroy the banner, but hold your ground until their chief, Murgut, appears to save face for the tribe.  Bring me the totem he carries.Gather your allies, <name>. This is no task for a single <class>.
89_It's a Sabotage_The Horde has wasted no time in shamelessly extracting this mysterious ore from the great wound.

Luckily for us, goblin engineering is not nearly as sophisticated as what we create in Gnomeregan! All it takes is a little bit of old fashioned dynamite to completely disable a goblin shredder.

What unsophisticated machinery!

Take these dynamite bundles and plant them on the inactive shredders around the mining camp.

It'll take those greedy goblins weeks to get back up and running again!
90_Traitor's Bait_The Twilight's Hammer agents still lurk within the confines of Orgrimmar. I need someone I trust to collect the final evidence of treachery.

<Eitrigg pulls you aside.>

I suspect that Sauranok the Mystic is involved. I need you to uncover the truth, <name>.  The Twilight's Hammer has placed their agents within the ranks of the workers at the airship docks to spread their lies across the land. Speak with them. If you find evidence of Sauranok's guilt then show him what happens to traitors of the Horde.
91_As Hyjal Burns_<name>!  We've heard much about you and your previous accomplishments.It is good that you've come here just as Azeroth finds itself in a time of great need.Deathwing's minions are attacking Hyjal and seek to bring the destructive Ragnaros back into our world.Aronus will take you to join Malfurion's forces in Hyjal. Lend them what help you can.
92_Good News... and Bad News_<Blackhorn used the power of Thol'embaar's remains to slip his bonds. But at least the inferno seems to be subsiding.><Matoclaw will want to know what happened here. She's waiting for you back at the Grove of Aessina.>
93_Into the Raptor's Den_The hunt deepens, <name>. Now you must find and defeat your prey within its lair.Hunt the Sunscale raptors to the south, where they have built a warren amongst the hills just off of the road. Slay them and remove the feathers they wear. Place the feathers on the sunscale raptor nests to show their brethren you do not fear them!Be cautious, <class>. Raptors hunt in packs and will swarm you if you are not cautious.
94_Where Is My Warfleet?_The Highlands are the home of the Dragonmaw orcs. If we show them our might they would ally with us against the Twilight's Hammer. I am certain!

The fleet is gathering at Bilgewater Port in Azshara but there are reports of delays.
You did good getting the goblins to work, I need your skills here too.
Find Warlord Krogg in Azshara and see what is taking so long.
95_The Battle for Broken Shore_The third fleet has shipped out ahead of us, <name>. This gryphon will bring you to them.

Good luck out there. It's clear the Legion isn't going to make this easy, but let's hope King Varian has matters well in hand.
96_Tailgunner!_Okay, I've softened this guy up, how about you help me finish him off?I've got a plan for our escape, but it'll require a lot of guts and a little luck.You up for it, <name>?Just follow my lead...
97_The Burning Blade_I've been sent to investigate the presence of more Burning Blade agents here in Durotar.  To the northeast, you'll find a cave where the organization trains their new recruits.  I'm interested in what exactly they are teaching these neophytes.I only tell you this because you seem to be looking for work.  If you're interested in a little coin, sack the cave and return with their spellscrolls.The cave is somewhat hidden: exit Razor Hill from the east, and follow the canyon's eastern ridge.
98_Drag it Out of Them_It is our instinct to simply lash out at our attackers, but wisdom dictates another path. We should interrogate one of these quilboar invaders and learn all we can. Take this net, <name>, and ensnare a quilboar pillager attacking our farm just west of here. Club the beast unconscious and bring him to me.
99_The Butcher of Taurajo_This operative had orders to secure the roadways between the Alliance command and Fort Triumph. General Hawthorne is on the move.<Bloodhilt crumples the documents in his fist.>It's HIM, <name>! Hawthorne - I spit the name - he is the one who ordered the assault on Taurajo! Now we know when and where to strike him down. Quickly, follow the road north of the Battlescar and meet up with my assassin Karthog. CRUSH Hawthorne and string his body up along the road!
100_The Blackmaw Doublecross_Andorel here has crafted a little bit of magic for me. Come, stand next to my fire, and steep yourself in the fumes from the tea. Drape the robes around you and you'll take on the appearance of a night elven ambassador to the Blackmaw.Don your disguise and speak to Andorel here in camp. He'll teleport you to the heart of Blackmaw hold, where the negotiations are to take place. Speak with Chieftain Ungarl and sabotage the treaty. Then, kill as many Blackmaw as you can on the way back!
