2_Delegation_I am duty-bound to look into your claims immediately, <race>, which means my mission here now must fall to you.A surge of ancient magic, far too strong to have occurred naturally, drew me here. I have since discovered a most troubling development.A bough from Nordrassil has been ripped from the tree and taken deep into the Firelands. There, a powerful ritual threatens to corrupt Nordrassil, consuming it in flame.You must find a way to interrupt the ritual and reclaim the World Tree's branch._Gathering
5_A Dying World_Champion. Magni Bronzebeard needs your help. Azeroth is dying. Before this war, a massive demon called Sargeras stabbed the planet with a sword. Our planet cries out in pain while the Horde and Alliance fight amongst each other. Magni Bronzebeard believes you can help heal the planet's wounds. Meet him in Silithus. He has set up camp where Sargeras's sword impacted our world._Exploration
12_Machines of War_Far to the east the ""Worldbreakers"" lay hidden in the Twilight Highlands. We must end their threat and we will do it with the most powerful army ever! Our new allies, the goblins, are making us new machines of war but I hear that there are problems with the quality. We can't fight with broken war machines. Speak to Foreman Glibbs and make sure our machines are ready for battle._Gathering
14_Just a Fancy Cockroach_Evidently, the ancient statues were home to various species of scarab.Determined to leave this site in the best condition possible, you resolve to ridding the chamber of these pests._Combat
15_Light Camera Action_Oh, hi! Isn't this a great shot? I love my S.E.L.F.I.E. camera! Do you want me to make you one, too? I only need a few parts!

Oh, and a Standard Scope, most any engineer can make you one of those. Ok, are you ready for a little photographyaction_Gathering
16_The Battle for Lordaeron_King Wrynn has mustered our forces, <name>. We mean to launch a full-scale assault on Lordaeron. We'll drive the Horde from the keep and reclaim it for the Alliance.

20_Supplies from the Uldum Accord_The Uldum Accord appreciates all the help you've given us. Please take these supplies as a token of our gratitude, and a promise of more to come, should you continue to help us._Gathering
21_Fel To Pieces_The infernals that lurk in Shatter Scar Vale are formidable, but not invincible. Much progress has been made in thinning their numbers.Destroying them is only part of the solution, however. I've found that the stone that infernals are made of still contains large amounts of fel magic even after the infernal's death.The rubble of slain infernals now litters Shatter Scar Vale, leeching its corruption back into the ground. If you could collect it and bring it to me, I would be grateful._Gathering
26_Farewell, Minnow_Thank you, little one.Sometimes it's easy to get lost in the throes of love and lose sight of things, even as a dragon. I plan to rededicate myself entirely to making sure Kalec never steps up to take Malygos' place. It's the most noble cause I can think of.You should head back to the harbor. I believe someone's waiting for you there.Try not to get squashed or eaten by anything._Exploration
36_Due Reward_You have served me well these past few minutes we've spent together - minutes I shall not soon forget.I believe a reward befitting your unwavering loyalty is in order.

38_Weapons of Mass Dysfunction_<Glibbs mops sweat from his brow with a greasy handkerchief.>Saurfang isn't happy with our work? This is very bad. My boys need to step it up.Maybe you can help set an example. A set of Hellscream Demolishers just rolled off the blocks and are ready for inspection. Give them a thorough going-over, and if you find any problems, give the Chief Engineer a good thrashing. Remind them that the Horde is depending upon them_Combat
39_Learn to Ride in Darnassus_This pamphlet advertising riding training and mount purchases was sent from Jartsam.Jartsam can be found at the Cenarion Enclave in Darnassus._Exploration
40_While You're Here_The Maraudine have raided the Gelkis camps for many years, stealing anything they could get their hands on.One of their favorite torments is to take these relics of power which the Gelkis hold sacred, and bring them here to be defiled.The Gelkis clan would certainly be grateful if you were to find and destroy these defiled artifacts._Gathering
41_Your Time Has Come_<A pleasant image fills your mind's eye as a calm voice echoes through your being.>Young <class>, be still and hear my words.I am called to collect you, to deliver you, to one whose eye none can escape.Find me in Stormwind, mortal, for your time has come._Exploration
44_Find OOX-17/TN!_You have uncovered some sort of strange, egg-shaped device made from metal.  Fiddling with one of its knobs springs the egg to life, as it opens up into some sort of gnomish robotic contraption!  A voice from inside the robotic egg crackles to life.The name's Oglethorpe, and my homing robot has gone missing!  I will reward you for its recovery!  Please take this beacon to the robot.  Excellent, I now have computed the coordinates for you!  It crashed near the Gaping Chasm in Tanaris!_Gathering
45_Dahlia's Tears_In this dark time, I'll not be the one to abandon a champion of the Light.We will need something sacred for this to have a hope of saving your Bridenbrad... a remnant of a devout being that fell victim to this very same plague.Go now to the sacred soil of the passages outside my Ruby Dragonshrine where the battle is joined. As my Ruby Keepers fly down and set flame to the ground beneath undead feet, you will witness new life grow forth. Among that life are Dahlia's Tears - bring them to me._Gathering
46_The Bears Up There_Do not fear the bears in this grove, <class> - I have pacified them for the moment.My concern at present is for the welfare of the bear cubs. The fires drove the little ones up the trees, where they've gotten stuck. We've got to get those bears safely to the ground!Flying creatures frighten them, so you'll have to climb the trees yourself. Look for footholds at the trunks. Climb the trees, grab the bear cubs, and toss them - GENTLY! - onto the target here.Nothing can go wrong with this plan._Exploration
47_The Offering to Azshara_The warlord said the horn of the ancients was being offered to Azshara above Nazj'vel.Perhaps it's not too late to save the ancient relic from being destroyed._Exploration
50_Finding Your Way_Stormwind has a lot to offer adventurers like us, but it's far too big to explore on foot. The captain has arranged for you to receive a mount to help you get around. She said to speak with Curly at the stables in Old Town... but I can't seem to remember the way there. Have no worries, <name>! All we need to do is ask a guard for directions. If you ever need help finding something, the city guards will show you where to go. Let's ask a nearby guard for directions to the stable master in Old Town!_Exploration
51_Gurtar's Request_I have a bit of a personal request for you, <class>.It has been many moons since I have seen my love, Draaka. It will be many more before we are able to be together again. I fear that as time passes, her love for me will wane.This braid has special meaning to the two of us, as do Thorned Bloodcups, the flower of this region.I ask that you pluck the flowers and weave them into this twine, then present the gift to Draaka on my behalf._Gathering
53_Echeyakee_Whitemist, or 'Echeyakee' in the tauren tongue, is the king of the savannah cats. He hunts with such stealth, they say he's like a thin, white mist on the earth. He kills so fast his prey have no time for fear or pain.The tauren say he is both mercy and death.<name>, I now set you on the path to hunt Echeyakee. His lair is just northwest of here, on the north side of a small mountain, among the bones of giant Kodo.Go. Blow this horn when you reach his lair. Blow the horn, and he will come._Combat
54_Banner of the Stonemaul_When the dragons came and took over Brogg's old home, Stonemaul ogres fled and left everything behind, including clan's banner.Brogg knows banner was kept deep in Stonemaul ogre mound, but these days it's called Den of Flame. Brogg must have clan banner to get his revenge on dragons who killed his friends.Brogg's clan's old mound, Den of Flame, is northwest of Mudsprocket and crawling with dragonkin. Banner will be deep inside the cave. Be careful, <name>._Combat
55_The Ancient Brazier_What do we have here? A <race>? Come to steal our land with your honeyed tongue and promises?You do not fool me. I have lived a long time, and I know what dealing with your kind means. But the khans do not listen to their elders like they used to.Since you are here, I will put you to use. When the waters rushed in, the great water spirit, Aquarian, doused the Ancient Brazier deep inside of Splithoof Hold.Use this brand to reignite the brazier. Aquarian is sure to come. Bring me the Sacred Flame._Exploration
56_Secondhand Diving Gear_There's plenty of wreckage strewn across the bottom of the water from here to Alcaz, and the Defias have already got divers out there looking around. With the help of some of their gear, we can get you suited up and ready to join the hunt, but you'll have to do some creative ""borrowing"" first.Search this island for a crate of diving gear and something to repair it with. When you've got them, bring them to me and I'll have your gear ready in no time!_Gathering
58_Walking the Dog_Hmmmphh.... it seems they'll let anyone in these days.Very well.  You doubtlessly became acquainted with Smolderos in the proving grounds.Well, I've been entrusted with the care of one of his pups.  Quite the little terror -- if he grows up to be anything like his father he shall serve our cause well.Collect meat from the basilisks around the area and feed them to him._Combat
59_To Be Prepared_Allies from across Azeroth have come to Stormwind to support our efforts against the Burning Legion. Before you ship out, you should pay them a visit. Every bit of preparation helps!_Exploration
60_Azsharite Experiment Number One_Well, I can think of one surefire way to send a giant running to the bathroom, but you're not going to like it. What we need is a ... massive ... laxative. Oh hey! Would you believe the gnomes have something of the sort? That can't be a coincidence. I wonder what they're trying to push through over there?Our intelligence reports that the laxative was delivered to Gadgetspring's tower, down on the shoreline south of the Secret Lab. Retrieve that laxative and feed it to Gormungan!_Gathering
61_Void Incubation_Well one thing is for certain with this egg, it requires great amounts of void energy in order to thrive.  It is fortunate for us that an Old God is attacking Azeroth at this very moment, yes? No? Oh... In any case, there should be an abundance of void energy wherever N'Zoth's minions strike. You should head out and find some._Gathering
62_Recover the Cargo!_Well, I was able to make enough repairs to this gear to let you dive for awhile, anyway. I wouldn't count on it holding out for a long time, though.The wreckage of the ship is strewn along the bottom from the east coast of this island out toward Alcaz Island. While that helm holds out, locate pieces of the wreckage on the bottom between this island and Alcaz. Use this salvage kit to search the wreckage for pieces of the cargo. Be careful not to venture too close to Alcaz Island. Those hydra are fierce._Gathering
63_Counterattack!_The Horde commends your successes against the Kolkar, but the Kolkar themselves are maddened.  I have reports that a contingent of Kolkar has traveled to the Barrens from their home in Desolace, to seek vengeance.  My latest report was that, even now, they move against these bunkers, from the west!Face the Kolkar invaders, and end their threat in the Barrens.  Kill them until their leader, Warlord Krom'zar, appears.  Defeat him and bring me a piece of his banner as proof.We're counting on you, <name>._Combat
64_Maatparm Mushroom Menagerie_Did you know mushroom hunting is far more dangerous than mushroom consumption? Mushroom hunters expose themselves to many unknowns - not including potential wildlife dangers!What would life be without a little danger? I am in need of mushrooms for my collection. Scattered throughout these unexplored wilds you will find four different types: An aquatic stinkhorn, a blood mushroom, a ruinous polyspore, and a fel cone fungus. They are each unique to various regions in Bloodmyst. Bring them to me._Gathering
67_Keep Your Friends Close_The Legion is bold indeed to strike at the Horde's stronghold! You aided our defense, but now I have a more important task for you.It seems the demon hunters will play a crucial part in this war... but I still don't trust them. You will be my envoy to the Illidari. Learn what they know. Study their techniques. If they betray us, we'll use their own knowledge against them.Their camp lies atop the plateau in the city. Go. Nathanos and I will clean up this mess._Combat
68_Learn to Ride at the Exodar_This pamphlet advertising riding training and mount purchases was sent from Aalun.Aalun can be found at the entrance to the Exodar on Azuremyst Isle._Exploration
69_A Prayer and a Wing_A winged visage? Could it be...?<name>, there's no time to waste. You may have been speaking to Aviana herself, trying to return to us.I'll need something from Aviana's past to reach out to her. High atop the ridge overlooking this shrine, you'll find a series of huge nests belonging to Blaithe, an ancient bird of prey that was once her consort. For ten thousand years he's been mad with grief.Go to one of his roosts, and use this call to summon him. Kill Blaithe and bring me one of his feathers._Combat
70_Twilight Skies_I just got word from Orgrimmar that the Warchief wants us to move out. We wouldn't have been ready if it wasn't for your help!The plan is for the air fleet to take off immediately, and for the navy to follow close behind. Hellscream will be accompanying the air fleet and specifically requested that you come along with us.No time to delay! Go to the Southern Rocketway Terminus here in Azshara, and check in with Friz Groundspin. I'll bring the zeppelin around to pick you up._Exploration
71_To the Rescue!_You're coming with me, <name>.There's no one else that I can spare, and we cannot afford for Splintertree to be lost.Prepare yourself, and speak to me again when you are ready._Exploration
72_Feegly the Exiled_Saddest story I ever heard told, <name>. Feegly was one of our fastest diggers, until he got a hold of that - thing. ""The Tear of the Moons"" we called it. It changed him. Remade him. I wish it had stayed buried.Feegly was banished from Bael Modan but I've heard reports he's come sniffing around the dig site again. He's suffered enough, the wretched thing. If you find him down there, put ol' Feegly out of his misery._Combat
73_Nat's Bargain_So you found a copy of Dastardly Denizens of the Deep, did you? Well, I can tell you from experience, it's all true. I've even seen a few of 'em with my own eyes.But you want to know about Tethyr.  I said I'd make you a deal, so here's what I want you to do. I'm working on a new line of baits, but I haven't tested this one yet.Just take this paste -- yeah, it smells a little foul -- smear it on yourself, and swim into the deep part of Tidefury Cove to the southwest. Let me know how it works!_Exploration
74_True Power of the Rod_Now, take the rod and while using its power, speak with my brother, Ota Wen.Ota is amongst the other furbolg that the orcs have captured and have penned in the giant cage on the north side of Silverwind Refuge. The rod will allow you to convince Ota and the other furbolg to rise up and attack the Horde.Then you may go wherever your path leads you. Just know that you have found a new friend for that which you have done._Exploration
75_The Trial of Fire_The Trial of Fire... oooh... sounds intimidating, doesn't it? No? Hm. Well I kind of thought so. Firsts are first, you touch the fire crystal and the portal to the trial opens.To beat this trial, you have to hop around in the fire runes without getting hit by the fire. If you stay unflamed long enough, you win!There are little signs to help you - fire hopping to its new rune, fizzles when a rune goes cold. You can figure that stuff out if you want. Or just guess! That's what most people do._Exploration
76_The Theramore Docks_<name>, two of our spies were sent to steal documents from a ship at the Theramore docks.  They gained the papers but were discovered, and were forced to throw the documents into the sea.One spy later escaped, but was unable to recover the prize.  He reported his failure to me, and I now charge the task to you.The documents are in a footlocker, in the waters somewhere beneath the Theramore docks.

77_Big Bad Beetle_It could do our hatchling some good to face off against another aqir, to learn what his kind are capable of. I have found an opponent who could provide a challenging fight._Combat
78_Escape From the Lost City_Everything is ready!  Undo my chains and set your friends free.We must move quickly before the Neferset scum realize we're up to something!If we make it, see my brother, King Phaoris for a reward._Exploration
79_Easy Money_Well, hello there!Whatever brought you, I'm so glad that you're here! My friends will never admit to it, but we could really use a hand.The ancient region of Uldum has been exposed! Treasures beyond your wildest dreams, free for the taking!We just need a bit of an escort, what with the bandits and all...You'll accompany us, won't you?You're welcome to all the loot you can haul off!_Combat
80_The Battle for Darkshore_The ancients of the grove have come to our aid, <name>.  I can see through their eyes even as we speak.The Twilight's Hammer has been forced to hasten their ritual and have thus only managed to resurrect but a remnant of dread Soggoth.Destroy it before it's too late, <name>.  I am needed elsewhere.Return to the druids at the Grove of the Ancients when it is all over they will direct you further._Combat
81_A Great Idea_Now that we've got a good pile of fresh chunks, we just tie it to this rope...and now you're ready to go catch me a silithid.What? Don't give me that look, it's perfectly safe. Well, mostly safe. Okay, you might die painfully. But it'll be easy! Just throw this meat out there, wait for a bug to pounce on it, and then drag 'em back here by the rope!Go after one of the swarmers. I haven't seen the other ones go for hyenas before, and you should find plenty of swarmers around the edge of the pit._Combat
82_Vorsha the Lasher_Vorsha the Lasher... the fiendish hydra that roams the seas...She has attacked our outpost, each time unprovoked, laying waste to anything that falls in her path.But I am ready, <name>.

I believe that if we put it out, Vorsha will appear in anger.We will need help, so be sure to bring some strong allies._Combat
83_Making Amends_You must've done something really bad to us or our friends, <name>. At any rate, I'm here to offer you a way to get our good graces back. As you know, Winterspring is quite cold. With so many of us goblins coming from other cities, we could use a hand keeping warm. Bring me some runecloth and coal and I'll put in the good word for ya. Be warned though, our enemies are not going to take kindly to your helping us._Gathering
84_Get Them While They're Young_I can teach you to ride a Winterspring frostsaber, but it takes time and dedication. For this to work, both saber and rider must be highly trained and both must share a bond of deep trust.The cubs are only receptive to this training if they're introduced to their riders at a young age. Some of the cubs in the dens surrounding Frostsaber Rock are at the proper age to begin their training. If you help me gather the most promising of those cubs, I'll allow you to begin training with your own cub._Gathering
85_The Last Wave of Survivors_It's too late for Laird, he didn't make it in time.The last wave of night elves from Auberdine attempted to escape a couple of hours ago. They stayed in their old home, clinging to the hope that it could be salvaged, but it seems they were finally forced out. I fear many of them won't make it, like Laird did not.Quickly, go down the coast to the west and find any survivors that you can. We're sending Sentinels and Hippogryphs down, but every moment counts - we need to know which ones might make it._Exploration
86_A Prisoner of Interest_The Twilight's Hammer wants to free Fandral Staghelm?Malfurion suspected his corruption ran deep... this just cements it.At any rate we cannot allow our enemies to get their hands on such a powerful arch druid.I've a plan, <name>.  We will move the prisoner through the Emerald Dream.  It will be risky, but with all the cultists present here it might be the only way to guarantee our success.Speak to Saynna Stormrunner inside the Barrow Dens to the northeast._Combat
87_The Grimtotem Plot_With the activities of the Grimtotems in Thousand Needles brought to light, many tauren now regard them with suspicion.  We've seen high-ranking Grimtotems engage in murder and kidnapping to advance their interests and I fear we may become their next target.Blackhoof Village, to the northeast, near Bluefen, is a large new Grimtotem settlement. Their leaders, the elders, will all have orders from Thunder Bluff. See if you can capture the orders and piece them together to learn the Grimtotems' plans._Exploration
88_King of the Foulweald_My research has paid off.I believe that with a show of force, we can diminish the furbolgs' aggressiveness.Take this banner a short ways northeast and place it on their totem mound. They will try to destroy the banner, but hold your ground until their chief, Murgut, appears to save face for the tribe.  Bring me the totem he carries.Gather your allies, <name>. This is no task for a single <class>._Gathering
89_It's a Sabotage_The Horde has wasted no time in shamelessly extracting this mysterious ore from the great wound. Luckily for us, goblin engineering is not nearly as sophisticated as what we create in Gnomeregan! All it takes is a little bit of old fashioned dynamite to completely disable a goblin shredder. What unsophisticated machinery! Take these dynamite bundles and plant them on the inactive shredders around the mining camp. It'll take those greedy goblins weeks to get back up and running again!_Exploration
90_Traitor's Bait_The Twilight's Hammer agents still lurk within the confines of Orgrimmar. I need someone I trust to collect the final evidence of treachery. <Eitrigg pulls you aside.> I suspect that Sauranok the Mystic is involved. I need you to uncover the truth, <name>.  The Twilight's Hammer has placed their agents within the ranks of the workers at the airship docks to spread their lies across the land. Speak with them. If you find evidence of Sauranok's guilt then show him what happens to traitors of the Horde._Exploration
91_As Hyjal Burns_<name>!  We've heard much about you and your previous accomplishments.It is good that you've come here just as Azeroth finds itself in a time of great need.Deathwing's minions are attacking Hyjal and seek to bring the destructive Ragnaros back into our world.Aronus will take you to join Malfurion's forces in Hyjal. Lend them what help you can._Combat
92_Good News... and Bad News_<Blackhorn used the power of Thol'embaar's remains to slip his bonds. But at least the inferno seems to be subsiding.><Matoclaw will want to know what happened here. She's waiting for you back at the Grove of Aessina.>_Combat
93_Into the Raptor's Den_The hunt deepens, <name>. Now you must find and defeat your prey within its lair.Hunt the Sunscale raptors to the south, where they have built a warren amongst the hills just off of the road. Slay them and remove the feathers they wear. Place the feathers on the sunscale raptor nests to show their brethren you do not fear them!Be cautious, <class>. Raptors hunt in packs and will swarm you if you are not cautious._Combat
94_Where Is My Warfleet?_The Highlands are the home of the Dragonmaw orcs. If we show them our might they would ally with us against the Twilight's Hammer. I am certain! The fleet is gathering at Bilgewater Port in Azshara but there are reports of delays. You did good getting the goblins to work, I need your skills here too. Find Warlord Krogg in Azshara and see what is taking so long._Exploration
95_The Battle for Broken Shore_The third fleet has shipped out ahead of us, <name>. This gryphon will bring you to them. Good luck out there. It's clear the Legion isn't going to make this easy, but let's hope King Varian has matters well in hand._Combat
96_Tailgunner!_Okay, I've softened this guy up, how about you help me finish him off?I've got a plan for our escape, but it'll require a lot of guts and a little luck.You up for it, <name>?Just follow my lead..._Combat
97_The Burning Blade_I've been sent to investigate the presence of more Burning Blade agents here in Durotar.  To the northeast, you'll find a cave where the organization trains their new recruits.  I'm interested in what exactly they are teaching these neophytes.I only tell you this because you seem to be looking for work.  If you're interested in a little coin, sack the cave and return with their spellscrolls.The cave is somewhat hidden: exit Razor Hill from the east, and follow the canyon's eastern ridge._Exploration
98_Drag it Out of Them_It is our instinct to simply lash out at our attackers, but wisdom dictates another path. We should interrogate one of these quilboar invaders and learn all we can. Take this net, <name>, and ensnare a quilboar pillager attacking our farm just west of here. Club the beast unconscious and bring him to me._Gathering
99_The Butcher of Taurajo_This operative had orders to secure the roadways between the Alliance command and Fort Triumph. General Hawthorne is on the move.<Bloodhilt crumples the documents in his fist.>It's HIM, <name>! Hawthorne - I spit the name - he is the one who ordered the assault on Taurajo!

100_The Blackmaw Doublecross_Andorel here has crafted a little bit of magic for me. Come, stand next to my fire, and steep yourself in the fumes from the tea.

He'll teleport you to the heart of Blackmaw hold, where the negotiations are to take place. Speak with Chieftain Ungarl and sabotage the treaty. Then, kill as many Blackmaw as you can on the way back!_Combat
