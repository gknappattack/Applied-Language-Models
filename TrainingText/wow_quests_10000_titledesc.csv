0,Champions of Azeroth : Assist Magni by completing 4 Azerite world quests.
1,"The Heart of Azeroth : Our world's dyin', <name>. Sargeras's sword has cut deep. Her pain is drivin' the elements into a frenzy!  I can hear Azeroth's voice, but she needs more than her speaker.  She needs her champion.  Far below us lies an ancient titan vault called the Chamber of Heart. I sense she wishes tae speak tae ye there.  Come with me into the chamber. It may be our only chance tae save her!"
2,"Delegation : I am duty-bound to look into your claims immediately, <race>, which means my mission here now must fall to you.A surge of ancient magic, far too strong to have occurred naturally, drew me here. I have since discovered a most troubling development.A bough from Nordrassil has been ripped from the tree and taken deep into the Firelands. There, a powerful ritual threatens to corrupt Nordrassil, consuming it in flame.You must find a way to interrupt the ritual and reclaim the World Tree's branch."
3,"They Grow Up So Fast : I think this little fellow will be a good match for you.This cub is going to require a lot of attention to ensure that he grows up strong and healthy. You should check up on your cub at least once each day. Feeding and caring for your Winterspring cub is the best way to build a bond of trust with him.As your cub grows, he will shed his old whiskers and grow new ones appropriate to his size. Once your cub has shed twenty whiskers, bring him back to me along with some materials for your saddle."
4,"Legion: The Legion Returns : Heroes of the Alliance, I write to you in Azeroth's darkest hour. From the maw of hell, the burning armies of the Legion have returned.  Our fleets depart for the Broken Isles at once. As a grand lance, we will pierce the Legion's lines and drive them back to the nether that spawned them.  Your ship awaits in the Stormwind Harbor, make haste."
5,"A Dying World : Champion. Magni Bronzebeard needs your help.  Azeroth is dying. Before this war, a massive demon called Sargeras stabbed the planet with a sword.  Our planet cries out in pain while the Horde and Alliance fight amongst each other.  Magni Bronzebeard believes you can help heal the planet's wounds.  Meet him in Silithus. He has set up camp where Sargeras's sword impacted our world."
6,"The Art of War : Lok'tar Ogar, old friend. It has been too long since last we spoke.It is good to see that you emerged safely from the depths of Vashj'ir.I am stationed here in Grommash Hold.All in service to the Horde are to swear allegiance to their new Warchief.You would do well not to keep him waiting, <name>."
7,"Toxic Tolerance : You want to ride a Venomhide? Then I've got bad news for you.The Venomhide Ravasaurs, they're all poison: Poison blood, poison spit, poison skin. You climb on one, you fall off dead in a few hours.You'd have to build up a resistance to their toxins before I sold you one, and that takes a long, LONG time... you'd need to be splashed with poisonous blood while fighting one numerous times. If you're really interested, the venomhides prefer the northern area of the Marshlands, northwest of here."
8,"Battle for Azeroth: Mission Statement : The warchief has requested to meet with you in person.  Lady Sylvanas was impressed with the prowess and courage you displayed during our mission to Exile's Reach.   Now that you've arrived, I will make the introduction."
9,"The Ritual Bond : I will tend to Grimclaw until his rest is done - he will be ready to return very soon. I have one more task for you while we wait... a favor to grant you, really, should you recognize it.The great wildlife spirits roam around us waiting and hoping for someone that will aid in stopping the destruction. They are with us as we speak even now, and with the materials  you brought me, I can grant you sight. Speak to these spirits, choose one, and return to me with their blessing."
10,"Hero's Call: Mount Hyjal! : By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Emissary Windsong at Nighthaven in Moonglade.Our brothers in the Cenarion Circle report that Deathwing's minions have launched a destructive offensive against the world tree and threaten to burn it to the ground!Speak with Cenarion Emissary Jademoon in Stormwind Keep to gain entry into Moonglade.For the glory and honor of the Alliance! Fight on, <brother/sister>!"
11,"Battle for Azeroth: Hour of Reckoning : Champions of the Alliance,   At last the time has come for us to reclaim what is rightfully ours! Our final push to retake Lordaeron Keep shall commence at dawn.   The Horde and their Warchief must answer for their crimes!"
12,"Machines of War : Far to the east the ""Worldbreakers"" lay hidden in the Twilight Highlands. We must end their threat and we will do it with the most powerful army ever!  Our new allies, the goblins, are making us new machines of war but I hear that there are problems with the quality. We can't fight with broken war machines. Speak to Foreman Glibbs and make sure our machines are ready for battle."
13,"Security! : It's not as like I haven't got enough to think about here!Keeping this place operational is hard enough without constant elf and draenei harassment.Now, on top of everything, there's an assassin lurking around the camp who's killed an important diplomat... on my watch!Whoever it is couldn't have gotten far, <class>. Scour the camp until you find her and then avenge the diplomat!At least I can bring the assassin's head with me when I have to answer to Hellscream."
14,"Just a Fancy Cockroach : Evidently, the ancient statues were home to various species of scarab.Determined to leave this site in the best condition possible, you resolve to ridding the chamber of these pests."
15,"Light Camera Action : Oh, hi! Isn't this a great shot? I love my S.E.L.F.I.E. camera!  Do you want me to make you one, too? I only need a few parts!  For the strap, I'll need a Russet Belt from one of the armor merchants in Stormwind.  I've already ordered more housings, you're welcome to take one, you just have to find where my shipment ended up!  Oh, and a Standard Scope, most any engineer can make you one of those.  Ok, are you ready for a little photography action?!"
16,"The Battle for Lordaeron : King Wrynn has mustered our forces, <name>. We mean to launch a full-scale assault on Lordaeron.  We'll drive the Horde from the keep and reclaim it for the Alliance. It's been far too long since our flag flew in Tirisfal.  Ready to ship out? Captain Angelica here will see to your transport."
17,"Elementary! : <You can't read the text, but diagrams seem to indicate that the devices around you should be activated in a set order.><One passage of the Apocrypha has been translated to modern text:>   In the beginning was shadow eternal.   Hate blazed forth, and FIRE was born.   Wounds scabbed, and so begat EARTH.   Cries of anguish birthed howling WIND.   Wherein the skies wept seas of TEARS.      We live in the shadow,      The world we know   Built of rage, hurt, anguish and sorrow."
18,"The Grimtotem Weapon : During the last Grimtotem attack, I was wounded, but not before I managed to capture a curious totem our enemies were using against us.It seemed to be emitting raw bolts of energy during the battle, but in all my experiments, I haven't managed to figure out how it works. I'll loan the totem to you if you agree to help me test it.The watery areas surrounding the farm are home to pesky mottled drywallow crocolisks and drywallow daggermaws. Try fighting the crocolisks near the totem."
19,"The Hopeless Ones... : On a ledge of the reef, deeper than where you found the bloodcursed naga, you will find the hopeless ones: The bloodcursed voyagers, ghosts of those taken by the bloodcurse.It is regrettable, what I ask of you now... but they must be destroyed and their cursed shells brought back to me.Their souls must be put to rest. Return to me when you have done as asked and I shall give you one final task."
20,"Supplies from the Uldum Accord : The Uldum Accord appreciates all the help you've given us.  Please take these supplies as a token of our gratitude, and a promise of more to come, should you continue to help us."
21,"Fel To Pieces : The infernals that lurk in Shatter Scar Vale are formidable, but not invincible. Much progress has been made in thinning their numbers.Destroying them is only part of the solution, however. I've found that the stone that infernals are made of still contains large amounts of fel magic even after the infernal's death.The rubble of slain infernals now litters Shatter Scar Vale, leeching its corruption back into the ground. If you could collect it and bring it to me, I would be grateful."
22,"Stalling the Survey : These maps have all been drawn by the same steady hand. I've seen a human surveyor heading up and down the road between the hold and the jungle to the east.We can set their plans back by making an example out of this surveyor, <name>.<Kilrok points to the signature at the bottom of the maps.>What do you think that says? ""Zykes?"" Even human names sound thin and weak. Kill him."
23,"My Own Drone : The saddle is complete. I can't say I enjoyed working with that corrupted metal, but in the end I can easily say this is the finest saddle I have ever crafted.  I know it looks... aggressive, but I assure you that your aqir will find it quite comfortable.  I hope it serves you well."
24,"Warchief's Command: Mount Hyjal! : All able-bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Emissary Windsong at Nighthaven in Moonglade.Our brothers in the Cenarion Circle report that Deathwing's minions have launched a destructive offensive against the world tree and threaten to burn it to the ground!Speak with Cenarion Emissary Blackhoof to gain entry into Moonglade. Blackhoof is located at the tauren district in the Valley of Wisdom in Orgrimmar.Onward, <brother/sister>! Destiny calls!"
25,Adventurers Wanted: Chromie's Call : Chromie is seeking veteran adventurers to embark on expeditions through time and space.This is your opportunity to experience the legendary adventures of the past--today!Speak with Chromie near the Stormwind Embassy for more information.
26,"Farewell, Minnow : Thank you, little one.Sometimes it's easy to get lost in the throes of love and lose sight of things, even as a dragon. I plan to rededicate myself entirely to making sure Kalec never steps up to take Malygos' place. It's the most noble cause I can think of.You should head back to the harbor. I believe someone's waiting for you there.Try not to get squashed or eaten by anything."
27,"The Stormwind Extraction : My lady is shrewd indeed. If we are to infiltrate Stormwind City, we will need the very best the Horde has to offer, and yet a team so small as to be able to infiltrate the heart of Alliance territory unseen.  <Nathanos peers at the gathered group, stroking his chin.>  Yes, I see.  The path ahead is clear. Speak to me when you are ready to undertake the Warchief's mission, <name>."
28,"Proving Pit : Ya done quite well for ya'self, <class>. I'm sure I could teach ya a trick or two here and dere, but I not be wastin' ya time on tiki targets no longer.l put one last trial before ya den, mon. Head over to da provin' pit in the middle of dis area and fight a real baddy - one dat wants ta kill ya back. Just let the jailor by the pit know when ya ready."
29,"Down From the Sky : The archers of Ramkahen are highly skilled, but the bows of the Amathet have the advantage of range. This makes our incursions into their territory highly dangerous.  You have a knack for fighting behind enemy lines. If you could thin out their ranks, it could provide us an opportunity to push their lines back for once.  Will you help?"
30,"Rider on the Storm : You cannot help but to feel a twinge of pride, having unlocked this long lost secret of the ancient worshippers of Elune.You now possess the power to inflict great damage upon your enemy.As it was Furien's tireless work that made this possible, it only seems right that the weapon should be unleashed upon those who took his life.The Alliance scum at Nijel's Point shall pay for their offenses against the Horde!"
31,"Open Their Eyes : Before you go...I've taken advantage of my ""alone time"" with Impsy here to learn some interesting facts about imps. Specifically, he ended up telling me the one thing that all imps fear most. Something they're absolutely terrified of.I thought that sounded useful as well as interesting, so I've done some basic conjuring. This prism will project an image of... well, of what Impsy described.Shadowlurk Ridge is still swarming with imps. Why don't you go test their reaction for me?"
32,"The Eye of the Storm : Greetings, hero of Azeroth.We of the Earthen Ring know you by name, <name>.Your exploits and accomplishments are many. Azeroth already stands in your debt, and yet again she is in need of her heroes.I am but a messenger. A powerful presence seeks audience with you.Peer into the Waters of Farseeing and behold the dilemma of our world."
33,"All Aboard! : You hear all of that, <name>? There are Alliance that need killing and I need to round up a veteran crew.You're coming with me!We won't be returning until our assignment's complete, so round up your things and make ready.I'll be aboard a newly commissioned gunship over Bladefist Bay.Don't keep me waiting!"
34,"Corrosion Prevention : Just look at this area! It's swarming with oozes. If I don't find some way to keep them under control, they'll corrode the wreckage and the zeppelin's cargo!I can't go back empty-handed, <class>! Help me dissolve these oozes before they've digested everything!This device, when powered, will concentrate energy on the slimes, causing them to explode. The zeppelin's fragmented power core should power the device. The one near the main crash works all the time, but the others flicker on and off."
35,"A Legendary Engagement : I expected that I would find you here, <class>. But then, we of the bronze flight have somewhat of an advantage when it comes to such things.<Coridormi smiles.>For reasons unknown to me, my master seeks audience with you.I would counsel you not to take this invitation lightly, <name>. Anachronos seldom has cause to interact with mortals. Wisdom would dictate that you seek him out in the Caverns of Time at once.Speak to me when you are ready and I shall personally deliver you."
36,"Due Reward : You have served me well these past few minutes we've spent together - minutes I shall not soon forget.I believe a reward befitting your unwavering loyalty is in order. You will have the distinct honor of placing Twinkles' favorite toy by his grave in honor of his memory.Please, please - save your thanks for Twinkles; it is not every day that we may honor a horse made of STARS."
37,"Aessina's Miracle : <The finger-like branches of one of Nordu's burning limbs part, revealing an untouched, glimmering seed.>This is the Heart of the Forest. The seed of life.Take this to your Arch Druid at Aessina's Grove - Hamuul Runetotem will know how to invoke its power. I promise you, the wilderness spirit will be silent no longer. New life will bloom from the ashes of old.Thank you, <race>. My time is done."
38,"Weapons of Mass Dysfunction : <Glibbs mops sweat from his brow with a greasy handkerchief.>Saurfang isn't happy with our work? This is very bad. My boys need to step it up.Maybe you can help set an example. A set of Hellscream Demolishers just rolled off the blocks and are ready for inspection. Give them a thorough going-over, and if you find any problems, give the Chief Engineer a good thrashing. Remind them that the Horde is depending upon them!"
39,Learn to Ride in Darnassus : This pamphlet advertising riding training and mount purchases was sent from Jartsam.Jartsam can be found at the Cenarion Enclave in Darnassus.
40,"While You're Here : The Maraudine have raided the Gelkis camps for many years, stealing anything they could get their hands on.One of their favorite torments is to take these relics of power which the Gelkis hold sacred, and bring them here to be defiled.The Gelkis clan would certainly be grateful if you were to find and destroy these defiled artifacts."
41,"Your Time Has Come : <A pleasant image fills your mind's eye as a calm voice echoes through your being.>Young <class>, be still and hear my words.I am called to collect you, to deliver you, to one whose eye none can escape.Find me in Stormwind, mortal, for your time has come."
42,"Touch the Untouchable : I've added a drop of my very own essence to the ooze. Look for a glowing sigil to the west, at the edge of Shadowlurk Ridge. Stand on it, concentrate, and pour this stuff all over yourself. It should be enough to shift you into the nether and let you see what's REALLY there.You won't be alone... the satyr's treasure is being guarded by the biggest voidstalker they could summon. Defeat him, and the treasure is yours.And come back in one piece, or this crazy broad's gonna fry me!"
43,"Druid of the Claw : After examining this charm, <name>, I see now what must be done. Please take it, and do as I ask.You are to approach the door to the nearby chamber. Inside, you will find my soulless body... Although I regret what I am about to tell you, I see no other way to free myself from the control of the Gnarlpine.In order for me to escape them, you must kill my physical form.  Once that is done, use the voodoo charm on my fallen body. After you have completed this task, please return to me."
44,"Find OOX-17/TN! : You have uncovered some sort of strange, egg-shaped device made from metal.  Fiddling with one of its knobs springs the egg to life, as it opens up into some sort of gnomish robotic contraption!  A voice from inside the robotic egg crackles to life.""The name's Oglethorpe, and my homing robot has gone missing!  I will reward you for its recovery!  Please take this beacon to the robot.  Excellent, I now have computed the coordinates for you!  It crashed near the Gaping Chasm in Tanaris!"""
45,"Dahlia's Tears : In this dark time, I'll not be the one to abandon a champion of the Light.We will need something sacred for this to have a hope of saving your Bridenbrad... a remnant of a devout being that fell victim to this very same plague.Go now to the sacred soil of the passages outside my Ruby Dragonshrine where the battle is joined. As my Ruby Keepers fly down and set flame to the ground beneath undead feet, you will witness new life grow forth. Among that life are Dahlia's Tears - bring them to me."
46,"The Bears Up There : Do not fear the bears in this grove, <class> - I have pacified them for the moment.My concern at present is for the welfare of the bear cubs. The fires drove the little ones up the trees, where they've gotten stuck. We've got to get those bears safely to the ground!Flying creatures frighten them, so you'll have to climb the trees yourself. Look for footholds at the trunks. Climb the trees, grab the bear cubs, and toss them - GENTLY! - onto the target here.Nothing can go wrong with this plan."
47,The Offering to Azshara : The warlord said the horn of the ancients was being offered to Azshara above Nazj'vel.Perhaps it's not too late to save the ancient relic from being destroyed.
48,"Protect the World Tree : <Ysera's eyes look distant, as if not fully acknowledging you.>I feel it as well, <class>. Ragnaros has arrived.We must defeat his minions before he can join them and lend them his strength.Seek Malfurion Stormrage at the Tranquil Grove, west of here, and aid his forces in any way you can.I must seek answers from within the Emerald Dream.  You must protect the World Tree until I return."
49,"Traitors! : Please, stranger.  You must help me.I came here to investigate the arrival of a powerful ally to the Neferset, only to be betrayed by my closest allies and given up to the enemy.Go to the terrace above us to the east and find the information I failed to uncover.  You'll need to hide from the Neferset.  Perhaps you can hide behind one of the large plants on the platform to conceal your presence.Do this for me and I will help your friends find their way to safety."
50,"Finding Your Way : Stormwind has a lot to offer adventurers like us, but it's far too big to explore on foot. The captain has arranged for you to receive a mount to help you get around.  She said to speak with Curly at the stables in Old Town... but I can't seem to remember the way there.  Have no worries, <name>! All we need to do is ask a guard for directions. If you ever need help finding something, the city guards will show you where to go.  Let's ask a nearby guard for directions to the stable master in Old Town!"
51,"Gurtar's Request : I have a bit of a personal request for you, <class>.It has been many moons since I have seen my love, Draaka. It will be many more before we are able to be together again. I fear that as time passes, her love for me will wane.This braid has special meaning to the two of us, as do Thorned Bloodcups, the flower of this region.I ask that you pluck the flowers and weave them into this twine, then present the gift to Draaka on my behalf."
52,"The Root of All Evil : <name>, thanks to you we have devised a way to summon forth the root of all evil for the Winterfall tribe - the corrupting demon that dominates them!Take this torch to the mouth of Grolnar's personal cave and plant it there.  Doing so will force the demon to reveal itself and investigate.  This is when you and your allies must strike it down!  Only the essence of the fallen demon will begin the lengthy healing process of the Winterfall tribe... and the salvation of Timbermaw Hold."
53,"Echeyakee : Whitemist, or 'Echeyakee' in the tauren tongue, is the king of the savannah cats. He hunts with such stealth, they say he's like a thin, white mist on the earth. He kills so fast his prey have no time for fear or pain.The tauren say he is both mercy and death.<name>, I now set you on the path to hunt Echeyakee. His lair is just northwest of here, on the north side of a small mountain, among the bones of giant Kodo.Go. Blow this horn when you reach his lair. Blow the horn, and he will come."
54,"Banner of the Stonemaul : When the dragons came and took over Brogg's old home, Stonemaul ogres fled and left everything behind, including clan's banner.Brogg knows banner was kept deep in Stonemaul ogre mound, but these days it's called Den of Flame. Brogg must have clan banner to get his revenge on dragons who killed his friends.Brogg's clan's old mound, Den of Flame, is northwest of Mudsprocket and crawling with dragonkin. Banner will be deep inside the cave. Be careful, <name>."
55,"The Ancient Brazier : What do we have here? A <race>? Come to steal our land with your honeyed tongue and promises?You do not fool me. I have lived a long time, and I know what dealing with your kind means. But the khans do not listen to their elders like they used to.Since you are here, I will put you to use. When the waters rushed in, the great water spirit, Aquarian, doused the Ancient Brazier deep inside of Splithoof Hold.Use this brand to reignite the brazier. Aquarian is sure to come. Bring me the Sacred Flame."
56,"Secondhand Diving Gear : There's plenty of wreckage strewn across the bottom of the water from here to Alcaz, and the Defias have already got divers out there looking around. With the help of some of their gear, we can get you suited up and ready to join the hunt, but you'll have to do some creative ""borrowing"" first.Search this island for a crate of diving gear and something to repair it with. When you've got them, bring them to me and I'll have your gear ready in no time!"
57,"Hero's Call: Uldum! : By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Adarrah at Thistleshrub Valley in Tanaris.Be one of the first to enter glorious Uldum and claim its treasures in honor of the Alliance!You can reach Adarrah's caravan by traveling to the western reaches of Tanaris.For the glory and honor of the Alliance!"
58,"Walking the Dog : Hmmmphh.... it seems they'll let anyone in these days.Very well.  You doubtlessly became acquainted with Smolderos in the proving grounds.Well, I've been entrusted with the care of one of his pups.  Quite the little terror -- if he grows up to be anything like his father he shall serve our cause well.Collect meat from the basilisks around the area and feed them to him."
59,"To Be Prepared : Allies from across Azeroth have come to Stormwind to support our efforts against the Burning Legion.  Before you ship out, you should pay them a visit. Every bit of preparation helps!"
60,"Azsharite Experiment Number One : Well, I can think of one surefire way to send a giant running to the bathroom, but you're not going to like it. What we need is a ... massive ... laxative. Oh hey! Would you believe the gnomes have something of the sort? That can't be a coincidence. I wonder what they're trying to push through over there?Our intelligence reports that the laxative was delivered to Gadgetspring's tower, down on the shoreline south of the Secret Lab. Retrieve that laxative and feed it to Gormungan!"
61,"Void Incubation : Well one thing is for certain with this egg, it requires great amounts of void energy in order to thrive.   It is fortunate for us that an Old God is attacking Azeroth at this very moment, yes?  No? Oh...  In any case, there should be an abundance of void energy wherever N'Zoth's minions strike. You should head out and find some."
62,"Recover the Cargo! : Well, I was able to make enough repairs to this gear to let you dive for awhile, anyway. I wouldn't count on it holding out for a long time, though.The wreckage of the ship is strewn along the bottom from the east coast of this island out toward Alcaz Island. While that helm holds out, locate pieces of the wreckage on the bottom between this island and Alcaz. Use this salvage kit to search the wreckage for pieces of the cargo. Be careful not to venture too close to Alcaz Island. Those hydra are fierce."
63,"Counterattack! : The Horde commends your successes against the Kolkar, but the Kolkar themselves are maddened.  I have reports that a contingent of Kolkar has traveled to the Barrens from their home in Desolace, to seek vengeance.  My latest report was that, even now, they move against these bunkers, from the west!Face the Kolkar invaders, and end their threat in the Barrens.  Kill them until their leader, Warlord Krom'zar, appears.  Defeat him and bring me a piece of his banner as proof.We're counting on you, <name>."
64,"Maatparm Mushroom Menagerie : Did you know mushroom hunting is far more dangerous than mushroom consumption? Mushroom hunters expose themselves to many unknowns - not including potential wildlife dangers!What would life be without a little danger? I am in need of mushrooms for my collection. Scattered throughout these unexplored wilds you will find four different types: An aquatic stinkhorn, a blood mushroom, a ruinous polyspore, and a fel cone fungus. They are each unique to various regions in Bloodmyst. Bring them to me."
65,"Dread Head Redemption : I sense that Durak is more than he seems. Demonic power is dangerous and it is easy to fall to its corruption - even for a trained warlock.   I do not trust him, <name>.  Find this Durak and tell him that the Horde will have nothing to do with him."
66,"Unfamiliar Waters : The Warchief has designs to launch an all-out assault on the Twilight Highlands. Once there we hope to ally with the Dragonmaw orcs.Through my own sources I've discovered that a Dragonmaw orc resides here, in Orgrimmar. He is known as Herezegor Flametusk, and once he commanded legions of their warriors.His insider knowledge is precious to us. Find Flametusk and obtain for us a chart of the Twilight Highlands waterways.Last I hear, Flametusk was washed up at a bar in the Valley of Honor..."
67,"Keep Your Friends Close : The Legion is bold indeed to strike at the Horde's stronghold! You aided our defense, but now I have a more important task for you.It seems the demon hunters will play a crucial part in this war... but I still don't trust them. You will be my envoy to the Illidari. Learn what they know. Study their techniques. If they betray us, we'll use their own knowledge against them.Their camp lies atop the plateau in the city. Go. Nathanos and I will clean up this mess."
68,Learn to Ride at the Exodar : This pamphlet advertising riding training and mount purchases was sent from Aalun.Aalun can be found at the entrance to the Exodar on Azuremyst Isle.
69,"A Prayer and a Wing : A winged visage? Could it be...?<name>, there's no time to waste. You may have been speaking to Aviana herself, trying to return to us.I'll need something from Aviana's past to reach out to her. High atop the ridge overlooking this shrine, you'll find a series of huge nests belonging to Blaithe, an ancient bird of prey that was once her consort. For ten thousand years he's been mad with grief.Go to one of his roosts, and use this call to summon him. Kill Blaithe and bring me one of his feathers."
70,"Twilight Skies : I just got word from Orgrimmar that the Warchief wants us to move out. We wouldn't have been ready if it wasn't for your help!The plan is for the air fleet to take off immediately, and for the navy to follow close behind. Hellscream will be accompanying the air fleet and specifically requested that you come along with us.No time to delay! Go to the Southern Rocketway Terminus here in Azshara, and check in with Friz Groundspin. I'll bring the zeppelin around to pick you up."
71,"To the Rescue! : You're coming with me, <name>.There's no one else that I can spare, and we cannot afford for Splintertree to be lost.Prepare yourself, and speak to me again when you are ready."
72,"Feegly the Exiled : Saddest story I ever heard told, <name>. Feegly was one of our fastest diggers, until he got a hold of that - thing. ""The Tear of the Moons"" we called it. It changed him. Remade him. I wish it had stayed buried.Feegly was banished from Bael Modan but I've heard reports he's come sniffing around the dig site again. He's suffered enough, the wretched thing. If you find him down there, put ol' Feegly out of his misery."
73,"Nat's Bargain : So you found a copy of Dastardly Denizens of the Deep, did you? Well, I can tell you from experience, it's all true. I've even seen a few of 'em with my own eyes.But you want to know about Tethyr.  I said I'd make you a deal, so here's what I want you to do. I'm working on a new line of baits, but I haven't tested this one yet.Just take this paste -- yeah, it smells a little foul -- smear it on yourself, and swim into the deep part of Tidefury Cove to the southwest. Let me know how it works!"
74,"True Power of the Rod : Now, take the rod and while using its power, speak with my brother, Ota Wen.Ota is amongst the other furbolg that the orcs have captured and have penned in the giant cage on the north side of Silverwind Refuge. The rod will allow you to convince Ota and the other furbolg to rise up and attack the Horde.Then you may go wherever your path leads you. Just know that you have found a new friend for that which you have done."
75,"The Trial of Fire : The Trial of Fire... oooh... sounds intimidating, doesn't it? No? Hm. Well I kind of thought so. Firsts are first, you touch the fire crystal and the portal to the trial opens.To beat this trial, you have to hop around in the fire runes without getting hit by the fire. If you stay unflamed long enough, you win!There are little signs to help you - fire hopping to its new rune, fizzles when a rune goes cold. You can figure that stuff out if you want. Or just guess! That's what most people do."
76,"The Theramore Docks : <name>, two of our spies were sent to steal documents from a ship at the Theramore docks.  They gained the papers but were discovered, and were forced to throw the documents into the sea.One spy later escaped, but was unable to recover the prize.  He reported his failure to me, and I now charge the task to you.The documents are in a footlocker, in the waters somewhere beneath the Theramore docks.  Find those documents, <name>, and bring them to me."

80,"The Battle for Darkshore : The ancients of the grove have come to our aid, <name>.  I can see through their eyes even as we speak.The Twilight's Hammer has been forced to hasten their ritual and have thus only managed to resurrect but a remnant of dread Soggoth.Destroy it before it's too late, <name>.  I am needed elsewhere.Return to the druids at the Grove of the Ancients when it is all over they will direct you further."
81,"A Great Idea : Now that we've got a good pile of fresh chunks, we just tie it to this rope...and now you're ready to go catch me a silithid.What? Don't give me that look, it's perfectly safe. Well, mostly safe. Okay, you might die painfully. But it'll be easy! Just throw this meat out there, wait for a bug to pounce on it, and then drag 'em back here by the rope!Go after one of the swarmers. I haven't seen the other ones go for hyenas before, and you should find plenty of swarmers around the edge of the pit."
82,"Vorsha the Lasher : Vorsha the Lasher... the fiendish hydra that roams the seas...She has attacked our outpost, each time unprovoked, laying waste to anything that falls in her path.But I am ready, <name>.

83,
84,"Get Them While They're Young : I can teach you to ride a Winterspring frostsaber, but it takes time and dedication. For this to work, both saber and rider must be highly trained and both must share a bond of deep trust.The cubs are only receptive to this training if they're introduced to their riders at a young age. Some of the cubs in the dens surrounding Frostsaber Rock are at the proper age to begin their training. If you help me gather the most promising of those cubs, I'll allow you to begin training with your own cub."
85,"The Last Wave of Survivors : It's too late for Laird, he didn't make it in time.The last wave of night elves from Auberdine attempted to escape a couple of hours ago. They stayed in their old home, clinging to the hope that it could be salvaged, but it seems they were finally forced out. I fear many of them won't make it, like Laird did not.Quickly, go down the coast to the west and find any survivors that you can. We're sending Sentinels and Hippogryphs down, but every moment counts - we need to know which ones might make it."
86,"A Prisoner of Interest : The Twilight's Hammer wants to free Fandral Staghelm?Malfurion suspected his corruption ran deep... this just cements it.At any rate we cannot allow our enemies to get their hands on such a powerful arch druid.I've a plan, <name>.  We will move the prisoner through the Emerald Dream.  It will be risky, but with all the cultists present here it might be the only way to guarantee our success.Speak to Saynna Stormrunner inside the Barrow Dens to the northeast."
87,"The Grimtotem Plot : With the activities of the Grimtotems in Thousand Needles brought to light, many tauren now regard them with suspicion.  We've seen high-ranking Grimtotems engage in murder and kidnapping to advance their interests and I fear we may become their next target.Blackhoof Village, to the northeast, near Bluefen, is a large new Grimtotem settlement. Their leaders, the elders, will all have orders from Thunder Bluff. See if you can capture the orders and piece them together to learn the Grimtotems' plans."
88,"King of the Foulweald : My research has paid off.I believe that with a show of force, we can diminish the furbolgs' aggressiveness.Take this banner a short ways northeast and place it on their totem mound. They will try to destroy the banner, but hold your ground until their chief, Murgut, appears to save face for the tribe.  Bring me the totem he carries.Gather your allies, <name>. This is no task for a single <class>."
89,"It's a Sabotage : The Horde has wasted no time in shamelessly extracting this mysterious ore from the great wound.  Luckily for us, goblin engineering is not nearly as sophisticated as what we create in Gnomeregan! All it takes is a little bit of old fashioned dynamite to completely disable a goblin shredder.  What unsophisticated machinery!  Take these dynamite bundles and plant them on the inactive shredders around the mining camp.  It'll take those greedy goblins weeks to get back up and running again!"
90,"Traitor's Bait : The Twilight's Hammer agents still lurk within the confines of Orgrimmar. I need someone I trust to collect the final evidence of treachery.  <Eitrigg pulls you aside.>  I suspect that Sauranok the Mystic is involved. I need you to uncover the truth, <name>.

Raptors hunt in packs and will swarm you if you are not cautious."
94,"Where Is My Warfleet? : The Highlands are the home of the Dragonmaw orcs. If we show them our might they would ally with us against the Twilight's Hammer. I am certain!  The fleet is gathering at Bilgewater Port in Azshara but there are reports of delays. You did good getting the goblins to work, I need your skills here too. Find Warlord Krogg in Azshara and see what is taking so long."
95,"The Battle for Broken Shore : The third fleet has shipped out ahead of us, <name>. This gryphon will bring you to them.  Good luck out there. It's clear the Legion isn't going to make this easy, but let's hope King Varian has matters well in hand."

97,"The Burning Blade : I've been sent to investigate the presence of more Burning Blade agents here in Durotar.  To the northeast, you'll find a cave where the organization trains their new recruits.  I'm interested in what exactly they are teaching these neophytes.I only tell you this because you seem to be looking for work.  If you're interested in a little coin, sack the cave and return with their spellscrolls.The cave is somewhat hidden: exit Razor Hill from the east, and follow the canyon's eastern ridge."
98,"Drag it Out of Them : It is our instinct to simply lash out at our attackers, but wisdom dictates another path. We should interrogate one of these quilboar invaders and learn all we can. Take this net, <name>, and ensnare a quilboar pillager attacking our farm just west of here. Club the beast unconscious and bring him to me."
99,"The Butcher of Taurajo : This operative had orders to secure the roadways between the Alliance command and Fort Triumph. General Hawthorne is on the move.<Bloodhilt crumples the documents in his fist.>It's HIM, <name>! Hawthorne - I spit the name - he is the one who ordered the assault on Taurajo!

The soil, the trees, the animals... all grow thick with fel magics.We of the Emerald Circle have sworn to cleanse this forest, and doing so requires a constant battle. While some life here can still be healed, the bears and wolves that wander nearby have been twisted too far.We must end their suffering, and ensure their bodies do not spread the taint further. Hunt the bears and wolves, and return to me with their hides."
105,"Someone His Own Size : While fighting alongside you no doubt provides excellent training for our hatchling, sometimes it is better to have him fight on his own against enemies his own size.  I know of one such opponent nearby, observing the Amathet near the Obelisk of the Stars. You should seek it out."

With her help, we can turn the tide of this attack and undo the damage Twilight's Hammer has done.There may be one who can help us. The oldest of the trees, Nordu, stood in the center of what is now the Flamewake for thousands of years. His wisdom is as old as this mountain. If that old tree still lives, perhaps he can awaken Aessina... seek him out."

109,"Winterfall Runners : Very interesting, <name>...When this toxic substance is mixed with the water from the hot springs, it loses its toxicity, only retaining the ability to temporarily affect those that ingest it. This must be why the Winterfall protect the hot springs so fervently -- they need them to purify their firewater.We need to stop this -- cut off contact between the Winterfall and the Deadwood. A group of runners walks the distance between their village and Felwood. Find and defeat them, and steal their shipment."

111,"The Wolf and The Kodo : My ""associate"" here has some plans for you that I don't agree with.  His actions are hasty, uncontrolled, and irresponsible, and you may end up paying for them with your life.Before you work with Gor, first listen to the tale that I have to tell.  It's a moralistic story - a fable - but I believe its lesson will prove valuable.  Speak to me when you are ready."
112,"Defias in Dustwallow? : My scouts have reported a shipwreck just off the beach to the northeast. Shipwrecks aren't all that unusual out here, but the reports also indicated the survivors were all wearing red bandanas... the symbol of the Defias!The reports indicate their leader resides on a large island just off the coast to the northeast of the tower. Kill him and retrieve any documents you find in his possession."

Point, bugify, squash! Quite efficient. Quite messy too... but again, worry not. No no, worry not, for afterwards, we don't have to clean up!"
114,"Words of the High Chief : The Winterfall are no longer a threat to me, but if you still want to find out what was driving the furbolg to create and consume this strange firewater, I think you should seek out Kelek Skykeeper.He's a druid that once worked to help cleanse Felwood with the Emerald Circle, and has since come here to study the nearby ruins.You might be able to find him to the east at Lake Kel'theril, where he spends his time recently."
115,"Take Down Tethyr! : Sea monster or no, we're not going to risk the safety of our shipping. I've ordered our best marksmen to prepare for a confrontation with this Tethyr. The artillerymen have augmented the dock's defenses with three mortars.I'm going to order the lighthouse's lamp illuminated. If Tethyr does attack, it will be your job to operate the mortars and take down the beast before it can kill all of the marksmen. I wouldn't stand in one place too long, though. Using the mortars is likely to draw its attention."
116,"The Ballad of Maximillian : The time we have waited for is upon us, Squire <name>.  Un'Goro's brood mother will perish at my hands.  The gravity of our task weighs heavily on me, but with the power of the Light behind us, we are guaranteed to succeed.Are you ready to depart?"

118,"Carried on the Waves : The Bloodpetals of Un'Goro have a fascinating life cycle.These trees in front of us bear seeds that fall down into the river when they mature.  The river's current then takes the seed north of here, where the seed hatches - almost like an egg - and a newborn Bloodpetal emerges.I require these seeds for my studies.  Take this net, and use it to scoop up the bright orange seeds in the river.  You'll have to hunt them down under the water."
119,"Lord Banehollow : Only one final power remains lurking in the depths of Shadow Hold now: Lord Banehollow.The Shadow Council here serves his whims, and even Fel'dan was a mere instrument for him to prepare this land for another invasion of the Burning Legion.Proceed carefully, <name>. A dreadlord is a terrifying foe. Stand tall and triumph!"
120,"Survey Alcaz Island : It looks like Renn's hunch about Alcaz Island was right. We need to survey that island, but it would take a whole brigade of troops to fight our way in there.Theramore's defenses can't weather such a hit, so I've arranged with Cassa Crimsonwing, the apprentice to Theramore's gryphon master, to allow you to use one of her beasts to survey Alcaz from the air.Alcaz Island holds the key to the mystery of the Defias' involvement in this kidnapping."
121,"Ever Watching From Above : When my master Khaz'Goroth shaped the world you call Azeroth, he designed Un'Goro Crater to be an area for experimentation.

126,"Catch a Dragon by the Tail : With the zeppelin crash delaying supplies, we've run out of medicines and bandages.We're making use of what we can, but between all the insects, the injuries, and the enemies we're encountering here, I can barely keep up! I've found one herb that seems to help heal wounds and dull pain, but it, too, is in short supply.It's called wyrmtail, and it's abundant in the Dragonmurk and Wyrmbog areas east of town. The plants themselves are made of coiled stalks, and seem to pulsate when you look at them."
127,"The Secrets of Uldum : We are ready to enter the antechamber itself, <name>. This is a momentous occasion.From the writings you've brought us, I believe these ruins were in fact once the grand entrance to Uldum itself.

The thrill of discovery awaits!"
128,"Matis the Cruel : Matis will be brought to justice, <name>; and I want you to be the one to find him and bring him back to the Triumvirate.Scour the island for this bastard.

129,"Behind Closed Doors : You've discovered the location of Khan Shodo's daughter, Kherrah. She is being held behind the doors to Maraudon!The rescue attempt is certain to be risky, but if you seek the Gelkis clan's cooperation, you must free the Khan's daughter."
130,"Challenge to the Black Flight : Brogg relishes the thought of taking his revenge on the black dragonkin of the marsh. <name>, you have been very helpful in preparing for this moment.

It gives the measurements in degrees Kraklenheit!Here, take it, and take readings of the temperatures at the ridge whenever you see a hot spot!Hot spots usually take the form of a glowing, rocky pillar jutting out of the ground.  You'll find them around the base of Fire Plume Ridge... one trip around the perimeter will likely suffice."
133,"The Spirits of Golakka Hot Springs : A moment of seriousness now, <name>.  We have an important quest ahead of us.  The treacherous dragons that plague this valley will not cease their mischief until we destroy their repugnant brood mother.  Before we even attempt to complete such a task, we must ask the Light for aid.I have seen the Light manifest itself nearby, in the form of Spirits floating by the shores of Golakka Hot Springs.  Come, I must speak with them, and ask them for aid."
134,"Crystal Clarity : Hi again! Oh, I forgot to tell you! I've devised a foolproof way to improve your S.E.L.F.I.E. cam!   In fact, with just the right gemstones, I can make a lens that would allow us to do all sorts of things!  Some fellow explorers have told me about a large basilisk out on Yojamba Isle in Stranglethorn Vale. Her hide is dotted with tons of high-quality crystals! What a perfect coincidence!  She sounds pretty tough, though! You should bring some friends!"
135,"The Trial of Frost : You know, some of my apprentices have called me cold hearted. I always say though, I shall not let the temperature of my body parts stand in the way of true learning.To reach the Trial of Frost, touch the Frost crystal to open a portal. Once there, the goal is quite simple - gather the little floaty ice orb thingies.To counter the simple, the rotating Frostburns may put back your progress, as it were. If you want to be fancy, you can use the rune traps to jump over them as they rotate by. Neat, eh?"
136,"The Forest Heart : You must get the Forest Heart to Gnarl at all costs!Down at the bottom of the Dor'Danil Barrow Den it sits, corrupted by the Horde. Only Gnarl can cleanse it.In order to move it, though, you'll need a Power of Nature.

137,"Identifying the Brood : Whilst that craven fool, Mok'Morokk, wallows in power and Tharg wrestles the demons of sorrow and vengeance and vies for leadership of the clan, I seem to be the only one concerned with identifying the source of aggression on our old home.Why the puzzled stare, <name>?

I shall trace the root of this evil..."

The boys and I are doing what we can to find the monsters who did this.I've sent our best investigator, Inspector Tarem, out to the ruins, but this is too big a job for any one man. If you'd lend Tarem a hand, we'd appreciate it. Light knows, we'd all like to be out there helping.The main road will lead you to the inn, but take care. Your journey will take you beyond the protection of my soldiers."

I see you've discovered the high road.The Alliance hopes to sever our ties with Stonetalon, but they forget that we tauren have hunted across these lands for generations. We know every hillside switchback and game trail from here to Thousand Needles.But for these paths to stay open, we must stop the humans from mapping them out.Patrol the trail east and kill any high road scouts you find along the way, then speak to Tunawa Stillwind just up the path."

150,"Smarts-is-Smarts : My monstrosity is taking shape! All that's left is to stuff his skull with something useful.I'm talking about brains, <name>. And here I'm going to be picky.

154,"The Bait for Lar'korwi : This will be the most difficult part because there is some complexity to the plan.  Continue following the river to the north, and look for a bend in the river.  It was here I saw Lar'korwi last.  You will know you are in the right area because of all the bones from massive creatures that once wandered nearby.Take the meat you recovered and place it there.  Then, rub this mixture I created on the meat.If both lures mingled together do not bring Lar'korwi to you, then I know nothing else that will."
155,"Delicate Negotiations : There is but one way to win the trust and loyalty of the Magram.It must be beaten out of them.They have suffered many losses in their war against my clan. They now possess an unfamiliar land, where they struggle just to feed themselves.Now is the time to strike.Speak to me when you are ready, then ride in and plant my spear in the Fatherstone. If we can kill enough of them, their Khan will submit to our will."
156,"Crystals of Power : I'm sure you've noticed 'em, <name>. They're everywhere!What am I talking about? Why, the crystals, of course!The crystals... They're all over the crater. Most people ignore them, but I have a strange feeling that they hold power within them.Say, I'm running a little low on the crystals I have here -- think you might be able to collect some more for me?  You'll find yellow crystals to the northwest, red crystals to the... oh, I'm sure you'll figure it out."
157,"Fade to Black : Now we put an end to all this madness. We need to rout the black dragonflight from Azshara entirely before they can return with any communication for their master.I still don't know what they have up their sleeve for capturing us, so I'd like to ask this one last thing of you - go into sable ridge and kill their leaders, Twilight Lord Katrana and Malicion.If things get hairy, I will come help. I just don't want to risk falling into whatever trap they set for Azuregos."
158,
159,"The Firelord : With his gatekeeper gone, you've given the Guardians of Hyjal access to Sulfuron Spire.Ragnaros will have no choice but to defend the main entryway to the Firelands himself.Go through the Twilight's Hammer portal at the Sanctum of the Prophets and meet me inside.

The displaced Razormane in particular grow desperate, and their attacks grow bolder. I've lost two caravans this week alone!Our warriors at the Crossroads desperately need those supplies, and I'm not about to let the quilboar grow fat off of their misdeeds. Find the missing supply crates and bring them to me. I'd search the quilboar hovel south of here, along the river."
162,"Gnomebliteration : I have downloaded my program to the fusion core and have complete control over it.I've created a small pocket of air inside to avoid vaporizing user <name>.I will yield control of all movement functions so I can dedicate my cycles to keeping the core stable.Go down the hill and neutralize as many of the expedition members as possible.My analysis reveals you might feel... ""guilt"" as a result of such high fatality numbers.User <name>, you must be assured that expedition members are without hope."
163,"Otherworldly Armaments : To craft a saddle for your beast, I'll need some special materials. Mainly, it will require metals much lighter than what we have available.  I have noticed that the Black Empire cultists carry with them weapons made from otherworldly materials, which are impossibly light and strong.   If you could retrieve some of their weapons for me, I may be able to melt down this metal and shape it into a saddle for the aqir."
164,
165,"Town Dwellers Were Made to be Saved : I've a feeling that we may find more than dragons here in this crater.  My paladin's instinct tells me that there are townsfolk nearby that require our aid. Those in distress cannot be ignored.Let us sally forth, Squire <name>!  The people of Un'Goro require our aid!"
166,"Azsharite Experiment Number Two : Okay, new plan. We'll SCARE it out of 'em! In my experience most large creatures are terrified of tiny ones - like rats. Hmm. This place is crawling with rats, but how do we coax them over to the giant?Hey! You don't mind having your cellular matrix broken down and reassembled do you? It's only painful while it's happening. I can shrink you down to rat-sized and you can ride one of these brutes over there like a horse. It's so crazy it's got to work! Speak with me when you're ready for shrinkage..."
167,
168,"Service with a Smile : Oh, simple <race>. Simple, simple <race>.I did not 'forget' to sweep up those reins from that foolish cakewalk of a knight they call the Lich King. I simply did not bother, as I already received the mighty steed during my raid last week.<Johnny motions to the horse on his left.>Since you're here and clearly intrigued by my sweltering greatness, won't you take that superfluous stallion to the assistant resort director in town? My coffers could use a bit of extra lining."
169,"True Believers : Now that I have the Twilight Lexicon in my possession, there is a small favor I'd like to ask of you.My former organization has a secret encoded bulletin they circulate on a monthly basis.If they make any progress searching for me or if they call off the search, word will be published on the True Believer.Although this information is obviously valuable to me, the publication contains other useful information that I can share.  Bring me any encoded texts you find on Twilight's Hammer members."
170,"Just Trying to Kill Some Bugs : Now it's time for my plan to go into full effect. We've got the captured bug strapped up with as many explosives as it can carry, and with Soothfancy's mostly amazing mental powers, we're gonna drive that sucker straight down into the center of the underground hive.And then...BOOM! No more bugs!You get the personal honor of directin' the ugly thing. Go talk to Narain and get set up with your bug-pal."

I don't have a good feelin' about this place!  To make matters worse, I've been gettin' reports of Alliance spies snoopin' around the camp!  Look kid, the Dark Lady has plans for this mysterious ore and I ain't going to be the one to dissapoint her, know what I mean?  Get over to the mining camp and take out those SI:7 spies before they ruin the whole operation!"

When you have steeled yourself we will speak again and I will summon forth a whirling vortex to speed your way up to the skies over Thunder Peak.Channel the power of the Earthen Ring through the elemental to slay Lord Magmathar so that we may bring him into balance once more."
173,"Into the Mists : <Nazgrim fills his lungs with sea air.>You smell that, <name>? It's the smell of our home, the lands our kind have bled and died to preserve.And listen... you hear that? It's the sound of peace and safety - a haven we've carved, where our enemies fear to tread.Remember these things. You won't experience them again anytime soon. We have ourselves a war to win.Now go get settled, we're shovin' off!"
174,"Find OOX-22/FE! : You have uncovered some sort of strange, egg-shaped device made from metal.  Fiddling with one of its knobs springs the egg to life, as it opens up into some sort of gnomish robotic contraption!

I will reward you for its recovery; please take this beacon to the robot!""""I now have computed the coordinates of the robot for you; it is in a cave near Feral Scar Vale!"""

Our progress remains slow, but measurable.Unfortunately, we've received several reports of stone quilen statues coming to life without warning. These quilen are too dangerous to ignore.Venture into the Court of Bones and destroy any quilen statues that you can find."
177,Stepping Up Surveillance : The cultists appear to be digging out the remains of a being known as Soggoth the Slitherer.Perhaps their superiors on the rafters above have more information.
178,"Watch Your Step : This is somewhat simple and somewhat not simple. All the way up there are Energy Conduits. Rather like this one right here one might say! Indeed, I do say.Now for you. You must use my jump pads to ascend the pinnacle, and you must touch all of the conduits you see along the way. When you get to me at the top, you should be all juicy with energy, because really that's the only way to be.And be sure to keep moving or you're likely to be sent for quite a trip!"
179,"Burning Blade Medallion : Through my divinations, I see that an item of power--a medallion--hides deep within the Burning Blade Coven, guarded by beasts and black magic. We must have it.

Use this staff to search through the rubble.Return to me only when you have located that which we seek!"
183,Fate of the Horde : It is a wonder any of our troops survived that bloodbath on the Broken Shore. If not for Lady Sylvanas...High Overlord Saurfang has been asking for you at Grommash Hold. He will not say why... but he was insistent that I send you to him.
184,"Warchief's Emissary : The goblins and the Horde have accomplished too much together to part ways now, <class>. I intend for the Bilgewater Cartel to become part of the Horde.I have something that I want you to deliver to the new warchief.

Go in peace, and never forget your people."
192,"Myzerian's Head : The head of one of Deathwing's most formidable black dragons is now in your possession.While many in Azeroth would pay dearly for such an artifact, something tells you that it belongs in a museum for all to see and remember.Harrison Jones is likely to have the proper connections.Sullah would certainly be happy to deliver it to him."
193,"Poached, Scrambled, Or Raw? : The venomhide hatchling's stomach growls as it gestures to get your attention. It begins scratching pictures of silithids into the dirt, adding small ovals underneath them. It looks at you hopefully and gestures at the circles.They can only mean silithid eggs. The Noxious Lair, in western Tanaris and near the border with Un'Goro Crater, would probably be a great place to find the eggs your little hatchling wants."
194,"A Taste for Grouper : Between boat rides and building, I'm exhausted... and hungry. You know what sounds tasty? Fish. Fish sound delicious.Darkshore is known for its grouper. If you fish me up some, I'll make it worth your time."
195,"Two-Tusk Takedown : This treasure's all fake, but it's not like those den whompers are going to know the difference. Stupid ogres!Here's the plan... you head into the Admiral's Den and spread all of this ""treasure"" around to any ogres that get in your way.

200,"Nature and Nurture : The ancient protectors of Irontree Woods to the north have been dead for years, their bodies a grim symbol of the damage to these lands.Every season, we take the water from this moonwell, and pour it on the ground before them, hoping it will nurture new life. If you'd like, you can deliver the water yourself.It is an excellent opportunity for reflection. Take this vial and fill it at the moonwell, and pour it on the very top of the small hill between the three ancients."
201,"Glyph Chasing : After our initial foray into the hives and Mistress Mar'alith's subsequent madness the three hives have been spewing out bugs! The increased activity might be tied into the glyphs covering those strange crystals.If I can get rubbings of those crystals and the glyphs on them, we might be able to make sense of this madness.Take this transcription set  and hit Hive'Regal to the east, <name>. That's the last rubbing I need!"
202,"Ursal the Mauler : Now the time has come to save the Druids of the Talon. If we fail now, <name>, they will be forever lost in sleep.I shall prepare the Relics of Wakening and perform the ritual.

Travel northwest on the road and find the path north into The Cleft. Ursal's den will be there."

Throw wide the doors of Dire Maul, leap into the arena, and cut down his attendants."

I can feel the corruption even from here and I dare go no further.While I am too well attuned to Ashenvale and the Forest Heart, you... you could descend into the barrow den and do what must be done. I've laid down breadcrumbs for you in there.Though it tears me apart, I must ask that you put to rest the druids' once great leaders: Taneel Darkwood, Uthil Mooncall, and Mavoris Cloudsbreak."

We must stop them here or there is nothing left for us.Across the Fields of Blood there are a number of strategic hills, marked by wooden towers and neutral gray banners.

208,"Justice Dispensed : I doubt the Grimtotems will give up their campaign to drive humans from the marsh, though I get the impression you probably don't mind that.

The elves of Astranaar are preparing to make a devastating assault on our camp as we speak.Drop our new weapon on them from the skies! The destruction of Astranaar will be a dagger in the heart of night elves everywhere!Speak with Thraka when you're ready to begin the assault.Aim true, <class>."
213,"Adder Subtraction : The corruption unleashed here must be studied if we're to find a way of properly fighting it.Luckily, not all the creatures have been as altered as others. The smaller snakes drink little water, and do not eat plants, so their exposure to the energies here has been minimal.

214,"Deadmire : Deadmire is an ancient crocolisk in Dustwallow marsh.  And it is his time to die.Old bones grind as he pulls his huge body through the swamp, and although he still moves with the strength and speed of youth, his aging body tortures the great spirit within it, a spirit whose flame will not waver.Yet now he lives in constant, maddening pain.

He will be a fierce ally in our fight against the enemy."

He defected to the Venture Company shortly before I left, and took his greatest techniques with him. He hoarded his secrets, doling out bits and pieces of knowledge to his trusted inner circle.If he built the samophlange, then he's probably got the manual. Last I heard, he was operating right here, out of Boulder Lode mine to the northeast. Get the manual from him, and collect the pages from his followers."
217,"Blubbergut : Ahoy, mon!You think you be able ta do something for da village here?Most whales we can handle fine, but there be a special whale out there that be too big for our spears.Blubbergut been gettin' bigger an' bigger - eatin' up the fish we use to live on!Get out there and find the thing, then make him pay for his gluttony!"

While your cub looks like it's enjoying the new game, you wonder if it might get more enjoyment from a proper cat toy.With a little bit of leather from a yeti pelt and some feathers from crazed moonkin, you could make a respectable toy. You'll need a hide from the yeti in the Ice Thistle Hills southeast of Everlook and feathers from the moonkin at the Hidden Grove or Owl Wing Thicket."
220,"Calming the Kodo : As you have by now witnessed, the rapid changes to this region can have both positive and negative effects on the native creatures.To the south and east of here, enraged kodo are a constant threat to anyone nearby.It's time to put my theory to the test. I've used the rejuvenated thunder lizard's blood in the making of this concoction. I'm hoping it will soothe the kodo when they eat it.Place it near an enraged kodo and make sure you do it from a safe distance!"
221,"Hezrul Bloodmark : Hezrul Bloodmark is the leader of the Kolkar centaurs in the Barrens. He is fierce, brutal and cunning. Defeating him would disrupt and fracture the Kolkars, greatly reducing their threat to us.So kill him. Bring me Hezrul's Head, and I will mount it from this outpost, so that they may know fear.Hezrul leads his people from the Lushwater Oasis, to the south."
222,"The Stuff of Legends : It is an honor to make your acquaintance, <race>.Your deeds echo in the ears of Azeroth's creatures, mortal and immortal alike.I shall present the heart of Ragnaros to Kalecgos when he arrives.

223,"The Black Shield : Ah, I remember now! Mosarn is a well-respected blacksmith in Thunder Bluff. I knew I had heard his name somewhere, before.In thanks, the Earthen Ring awarded me with a set of armor crafted by Mosarn. Very good work.Perhaps he can tell you more about the shield he crafted.It's not much of a lead, but since we didn't get anything useful out of Reethe, it's all we have."
224,"A Strange Disc : The etching around the surface of this object indicates that it is of ancient origins, and yet no signs of wear can be detected.A hole on its edge, full of splintered wood, indicates that it is meant to be put atop a wooden staff of some sort.Before showing this to Doctor Jones, you should find the other piece."

226,"The Zeppelin Crash : Not long ago, a goblin zeppelin crashed to the east. A representative of the Steamwheedle Cartel passed through here a few days ago.She was looking for information about the zeppelin's cargo and its pilot, Beezil, but none of us really got a good look at the crash. I doubt she'll be able to clean up after the wreck by herself, much less recover whatever cargo the vessel might have carried.If you have time, you may want to check up on her out at Beezil's Wreck, due east of here, near the mountains."
227,"Blown Away : Please, <mister/miss>, you just gotta help me!Father bought me a bunch of balloons from the Darkmoon Faire. They're magical, you know, and never lose their floatiness!There's just one thing...A gust of wind blew them out of my hands. They're scattered all over Stormwind!I'd chase after them myself, but this city's so big I'd get lost for sure.Can you find them for me before they float away?Please?"
228,"Oh, Deer! : Do you speak deer? It's all in the nose.<She points to her nose.>The does have fled the fires, but their little fawns - Some of them are still trapped in the burning and the hurt!Go back into the Inferno and escort three injured fawns back here to their mothers right here beside me.Please save the little fawns, or I'll give you the big eyes!<Her eyes grow big and dewy.>"
229,"Do the Imp-Possible : The satyr hide their corrupted moonwell behind an impenetrable barrier of demonic fire. Their forces must have some way of getting through it.Interrogating the satyr will be useless, but the imps they consort with will be easily swayed. I have a specific one in mind, as well...In the foothills to the east, a lone imp has been seen wandering, far from the other demons. He should prove easy pickings. Weaken him with combat, and then use this enchanted sack to capture him. Then I'll do the talking..."
230,"Threat of the Winterfall : I came to Winterspring to investigate the Frostfire Hot Springs. I've noticed that the water seems to have... strange qualities. I haven't yet been able to discover the source, and to tell you the truth, I've had some difficulty lately, due to the Winterfall furbolg.They seem to be drawn to the springs, just as I am. They have become extremely protective of the water, and won't let me come near the two larger springs to the north of here.I'd like to continue my studies, so won't you help me?"
231,"Ready the Air Force : I gave Hellscream my personal guarantee that I'd have his airfleet ready this week, but our flagship - The Spear of Durotar - still doesn't have its primary engines installed.Fleep promised me a dangerously shiny new engine last week. Go to her junkyard behind the bank and find out what the holdup is.The airfleet is waiting on us, <name>!"
232,"Bar Fight! : Those no-good, smelly, green in the gills goblins have got it coming!I want you to go into the Speedbarge Bar, order a bottle of grog, and hit one over the head with it!Show them that we're not going to take any more of their insolence, <name>!"
233,"From the Mouth of Madness : I know of a draught that should jolt these gibbering former slaves back to reality. Gather some stonebloom from the rocks around Gar'gol's hovel, some bitterblossom from the shores of the nearby lake, and a darkflame ember from one of the braziers at the hovel entrance.

It housed a priceless relic, the Chalice of Elune, entrusted to the shrine's keepers by the priests of Elune.

I must know, <name>."
288,"Return and Report : It is done! Together we were able to bring down a dangerous adversary.Neptulon himself shall hear of your exploits here, <class>.

Transformed by the rod, Dartol would have to speak to a furbolg who was uncorrupted.I would start with one known as Krolg. Seek his hut southeast of Mystral Lake."

My local contacts have reported that the deserters base their operations in a ship moored on a small island to the southeast of the docks.Arresting their leader, Gavis Greyshield, should cause the others to lose their will to fight.

Necromancy can just be so much fun!Touch the Shadow Crystal to open a portal to my Trial of Shadow. Once there, move to the Altar when you are ready to begin.Weeping Souls shall begin to pursue you... your goal is simply to drag them into the traps. And be sure not to let them touch you."
312,"Keep the Fires Burning : This is no small task, <race>!We have more ships arriving, and without the lighthouse they'll be lost - or worse! You are hereby charged with keeping its fire lit.Collect the blubber from the hydras in these waters, then bring it to the forge here to melt it into oil.Throwing that oil on the lighthouse fire will buy us the time we need."
313,"Moonglade Calls : I have received word that our brothers in Moonglade have requested your help, <name>. You should travel there and speak with Loganaar in Nighthaven. He will tell you all you need to know."
314,"We're Here to Do One Thing, Maybe Two... : You're in Hellscream's army now, <name>, and in Hellscream's army we kick butt and take names. Gone are the days of our people starving in the streets of Orgrimmar as we sign treaties with elves. We take what we need now. Kalimdor belongs to the Horde!The Alliance attempts to stop our expansion every chance they get. Unsatisfied with owning most of the Eastern Kingdoms, those pig-lickers want it all!Overlord Krom'gar has called for more troops in Stonetalon. Get on the caravan west of here and go!"
315,"Vyral the Vile : We have discovered another base of operations for the Twilight's Hammer.  It is called Twilight's Run; it is a cave tucked in the northeast corner of Silithus.  The local leader of the cult, Vyral the Vile, haunts that cave - it is he who you must next defeat.  When you have done this, bring me his signet ring.Fortune to you, <name>.  The horrors of Twilight's Run are formidable indeed."
316,"A Trip to the Moonwell : It didn't work.<A sorrowful and resigned expression upon his face, Pelturas removes the tear from the soup and gently washes it.>The eruption of Thunder Peak must have affected it in some way. You must take the tear to the Moonwell of Purity, which still lies intact, protected by the goddess' power, at the southeast base of the volcano.There, you will wash it in the sacred waters of Elune. What happens beyond that, I cannot say. I fear for my daughter's life. It is in your hands now, <name>."
317,"Lightning in a Bottle : Lo'Gosh granted me a vision while you were in the hovel, <name>. I saw you striding across the Lightning Ledge, with lightning bolts in your hand. The vision was powerful: Lo'Gosh feels this is of utmost importance. We must not fail the ancient.Upon the Lightning Ledge, Twilight's Hammer has been experimenting with devices they call ""Lightning Channels.""Investigate one of these channels, then use this totem to summon the Spirit of Lo'Gosh and learn what the ancient is planning..."
318,"Pirate Accuracy Increasing : I don't know if you've noticed, but the cannonballs are hitting us. I'd say the Southsea pirates are getting more accurate... the ship is on fire!You've got a river boat now. Go talk to Mazzer Stripscrew.Put those fires out!"
319,"Coming Out of His Shell : It looks like our egg is ready to hatch! Isn't this exciting!  Come, let us welcome our new little friend to this world."
320,"Razormaw : Many of the black dragonflight were slain during the attacks. One of them, a lieutenant of Deathwing himself, still haunts this place. If you look to the heavens, you can see his spectral countenance circling the skies. His hatred is so great that he remains even in death.Take the bones that you gathered for me earlier to the top of the mountain on this island and place them in the ever-burning pyre. This act should signal Razormaw to descend. When he does, slay his undead form."
321,Lessons From the Past : This unfortunate explorer has clearly suffered a bit of bad luck in the recent past.Prudence dictates that you perform the unenviable task of searching the corpse for clues that might shed light on your surroundings...
322,"Prisoners of the Grimtotems : We're doing all we can to keep the Grimtotem raiders at bay, but they keep launching assaults on the tower. Even worse, they've managed to discover and capture the patrols the captain sends out to gather information and safeguard the road.I suspect the captives are being held in Blackhoof Village, to the northwest. Knowing the Grimtotems, the defenders of the village probably carry the keys to the prisoners' cages with them. I don't care what you have to do, <class>, just bring back my men alive."
323,Twilight Riot : I thank you for freeing me.  Let us take advantage of the distraction you've created and get out of here.We must hurry before the cultists catch on.Meet me again when we've left this place.
324,"Kolkar Leaders : The centaurs have plagued the tauren for years. And recently, the Kolkar centaurs of the Barrens have grown into a real threat. Normally they were disorganized in these lands, but new leaders have risen among them. Rallying them.To preserve our holdings here, these centaur leaders must be destroyed.Bring me the head of Barak Kodobane. He camps west of these Forgotten Pools.Defeat him, then return to me."
325,"More than Coincidence : We've gleaned as much as we can from the ruins of the inn. I'm concerned about where the investigation will lead us from here, but we must know the truth.Between the hoofprints and the shield with Mosarn's mark, I'm led to believe that the Grimtotems may have been involved. They've recently established a settlement in the swamp, Blackhoof Village to the northeast. Travel to Blackhoof Village and search for more arms of Mosarn's manufacture."
326,"Hunting Brendol : I'm too busy collectin' artifacts to busy myself with much else, but there is a bit of an issue here I wouldn't mind sortin' out.There's a forsaken apothecary who's been pokin' around these parts for a while now. Normally, I'd ignore him, but three times now he's snuck into my camp and pilfered my supplies.... enough's enough!Find the thief and bring me whatever's left o' my things!"
327,The Hammer and the Key : My Nemesis. Still lives.The servants of fire still come.We must pursue. Into their den.The ogres know the way.Slay the Field Captains.Recover the Glyph of Opening.This is the way.
328,"... and Bugs : Another component of my new recipe is the shelled leg of a giant crab.  And the crabs they have in Dustwallow -- spiny rock crawlers they call them -- will be perfect!The shell of the crab leg is a key element of the dish's presentation so I need pristine, unscarred legs.  An adult crab might only have one or two such legs, and I need a lot in order to research my dish.Head on over to the rocks surrounding Theramore and get me those legs!"
329,"Ferocitas the Dream Eater : The emerald... It is missing! My dreamcatcher has been damaged!There is a band of Gnarlpine mystics located to the north of Starbreeze. I have heard reports that their leader, Ferocitas the Dream Eater, has been wearing a necklace that glows green in the night. Now seeing my dreamcatcher, I am sure that he has stolen my emerald... He would never realize that its power is useless to him.Find this missing jewel, <name>. And, while you're there, clear out some of the corrupted mystics as well."
330,"Egg Hunt : Skylord Omnuron wants us to find Aviana's Egg, and I can almost guarantee you it's cloaked by one of Sethria's shadow devices.Search around the camp for shadow cloak generators and shut those things down until you find the egg.Once you've unveiled it, I'll call out to the other druids. Defend that egg until we can carry it off to safety.Go get that egg, <name>!"
331,"Ogre Abduction : This is neither a crude ogre trinket, nor an ancient relic made by my kind. Its specific construction is new to me...and this fact disturbs me greatly.The wolf-girl will be sending you to Dire Maul soon, to fight the Gordok elite. They are the leaders of the Gordunni, and would know who is supplying these.Take the orb back, I've cast a few enchantments on it. Hold it up in front of a weakened Gordok ogre, and once you've captured him, bring it back here."
332,"Learning from the Crystals : Welcome to Blood Watch, <class>. Seeing to the defenses of the outpost is my primary concern, but I've also been tasked with a variety of other duties by our leaders at the Exodar.The problem is that it's hardly safe to send out large amounts of researchers when the island is this dangerous. I need someone to gather a series of crystal samples from various sites on the island.The first sample I need must come from the ravager infested ship debris south of the town and across the bridge."
333,"Slash and Burn : Victory is possible, <name>.This portal is not just a means of bringing back Cenarius through the dream.  Think about it, <name>.  Once a gateway through the Emerald Dream is open, our forces can use them to move freely from Moonglade, Nordrassil, and even Wyrmrest, to this strategic location.All Ysera needs is time. It'll be up to you to keep the Twilight's Hammer forces in Darkwhisper Gorge from pulling together and attacking us from the east.Take one of the emerald drakes and hit them hard, <name>."

335,"Things Left Behind : The invading aqir forced the Wastewanders to flee many of our settlements in Uldum. In our haste to escape, much was left behind.

You can keep anything of use to you, of course."
336,"Fetid Filets : You know, it occurred to me that since this creature has been imbued with void energy, it may prefer a more... corrupted food source.  I speak, of course, of the Minions of N'Zoth.  It's a long shot, but it's worth a try."
337,More Fetid Filets : Our little guy is getting hungry again.   Could you pick him up a quick bite to eat?
338,"Stupid Drizle! : Stupid, stupid Drizle! I told him not to go!Drizle wanted to steal more honey from Felpaw Village... you know, just west of here? You can see it from the cliff...Anyway...

Even if he is a dummy! I don't want Drizle to get eaten!"
339,"Special Delivery for Brivelthwerp : I recently came into possession of something that needs to be delivered to a gnome that goes by the name, Brivelthwerp. It's more like Briveltwerp if you ask me.I want you to take it to him in the southwest, down at the Sunken Dig Site. He's up to something and there's moolah involved... I can smell it!Keep an eye on what he's doing, <name>, and see if you can't get a cut of his profits. A big cut!"
340,"The Titans' Terminal : Now that we have the disc, a lot of our earlier finds are starting to make sense. Shortly after my arrival, Prospector Remtravel unearthed what he presumed to be a prehistoric toaster.It's my belief that this slotted box is some sort of data reader. Unfortunately, it broke apart and washed away with the rest of our base camp when the tidal wave struck!It can't have gone far, <name>. Pieces must be buried in the nearby sand. Here, use my trusty buried artifact detector to comb the beach for them."
341,"By the Light of the Stars : Look at this, <name>.<Harrison holds up the dead scout's goggles.>I tightened the clamp in the middle and crimped the wires on the edges. They may not be the most comfortable, but they should hold together.If I've translated your tablets correctly, there's something hidden here - a final piece to our puzzle.I hope your spectacles hold the key.Let me know what you find!"
342,"They Don't Know What They've Got Here : Listen, <name>. I don't have a lot of time to talk here.These guys are excavating relics from this site and taking pieces of ancient technology that we need!I need you to check their crates for pieces of an ancient activation device. The officers should have the codes you'll need to open them.Hurry!We can't let them load this stuff into their planes!"
343,"Smoke in Their Eyes : I'm not sure what knuckle-headed plan your friend is concocting, but we're going to need a distraction if we're to stand a chance of escaping.Take the torch from that brazier and go start some fires.Perhaps if we divert the Neferset scum's attention away for a few minutes, we'll have the opportunity we need."
344,"A Little Help From My Friends : Ugh... It's so hot...I was exploring this area, when all of a sudden, the heat just became unbearable. I must be suffering from heat exhaustion.Please, help me get back to my friend Spraggle at Marshal's Stand. I think I'm well enough to follow you there.I am feeling a little out of it, so you can slap me if I'm feeling woozy.  If I do happen to faint again, just splash some water on me from Spraggle's canteen. That should work, I hope..."
345,"Mastering Puppets : <During your brief communion with the Eye, you felt that its power source lay deep within the hovel. You felt the weight of a powerful tome, binding together four elements.><Mastering the Eye will require you to search the hovel for this tome.>"
346,"The Ravaged Caravan : I was part of a caravan taking supplies to the Orebor Harborage in Zangarmarsh. As we were nearing the border of the marsh, we were jumped by a vicious squad of Warmaul ogres. They killed the others and took me prisoner, along with all of our supplies.Thankfully, they neglected to place a backing on my cage. When they fell asleep, I made my escape.It's too late for my comrades but we could really use the supplies they stole. Warmaul Hill is in the northwestern mountains of Nagrand."
347,"Return to Jaina : We must make plans to destroy the remnants of the Defias. Please convey my thanks to Lady Jaina, back in Theramore.

349,"What's Your Specialty? : Hey, <name>! Have you decided on a combat specialization yet?  Since you're a <class>, you already know about the different classes available to adventurers. But did you know that there are also areas of specialization within each class?  Choosing a specialization is an important decision.

350,"Black Heart of Flame : Now you will use our newfound knowledge to pull Thol'embaar into the mortal plane like a babe screaming from the womb. Then you will crush him.The ritual is simple: take this charred branch, tap it on the ground three times, and utter his name aloud.You must call him from within the heart of the Inferno. Destroy him, and bring his black heart back to me."
351,"The Low Road : This bundle of papers was found in a leather satchel hidden under the officer's clothes.Battle maps of the region depict Honor's Stand, connected to what appears to be a large unfinished roadway crossing the Barrens all the way from Theramore. It looks like the Alliance plans to build a road from the coast straight into the heart of Kalimdor!Kilrok Gorehammer will want to see this."
352,"An Ocean Not So Deep : You look like an able sort!There are a great number of wrecks off of the coast here... most old, some new. For quite some time, I've been trying to get at their holds and put their valuables to more use, but there's a nasty infestation of murlocs that seem to have other ideas. I've sent scores of adventurers and none have returned.Worry not, I've learned my lesson, and that is not your fate. Swim to the due north and look for Gary. He'll explain the new plan. It's pretty simple really."

Dere you'll be meetin' Master Gadrin.

If you're still eager to do good deeds, or just get paid, I've got something you might be interested in.Starfall Village is just northwest of Everlook. The night elves there recently suffered a pretty nasty bug infestation, and they're asking for any help they can get.A few goblins from here already went there to start exterminating, but I'm sure there's room for more. Talk to Wynd Nightchaser, he'll fill you in."
356,In the Outhouse : Hello? Hello! HELP!I'm almost out of air! You have to get me out of here!<The voice inside gags.>One of those Southsea treasure hunters has got to have a crowbar!
357,"The Fossil-Finder 3000 : One of the things I hate the most about digging is the fact that half the time, all you find is dirt.  That's why I've been spending most of my time out here tinkering instead of digging.Let me show you what I've invented: the Fossil-Finder 3000.  I just put the finishing touches on it.  If it works properly, it should find the largest fossils in the area.  I know, sweet, huh?Test it out and see if you can find some ridiculously big dinosaur bones."
358,"Playing With Felfire : <Draaka leans down to speak to you.>Listen... Before you say anything, I KNOW we're not to meddle with demonic energies....But look around you! These are desperate times, <class>.We'll most likely die here, regardless. May as well go out in a blaze of glory, I say!So... Are you in?Take this canister and go southeast to Felfire Hill.

359,"Hungry, Hungry Hatchling : The venomhide hatchling looks at you expectantly, then begins to scrawl a pictogram into the dirt.The drawings are rough, but you can make out the shapes of diemetradons, stegodons, and pterrordaxes. As the raptor finishes the sketch, it looks up at you, bares its teeth, and makes a biting motion.Your venomhide hatchling must be craving fresh meat from these animals. Find and kill any type of diematradon, stegodon, or pterrordax in Un'Goro Crater and feed its meat to your hungry hatchling."
360,"Thieving Little Pluckers : I don't have the most glamorous job in the world.I do not concern myself with matters of war or the deep mysteries of the halls of Uldum or what have you.I am in charge of these grounds... and these grounds grow dates.Now, these little date-plucking mongrels have gotten gutsy enough to stand on each other's shoulders to try and steal my precious fruit.I will not stand for this.Take this mallet, crafted by the titans, blessed by the sun-kings and who-knows-what-else and smash the runts!"
361,"Catch and Release : The Blacksilt murlocs on the southwestern coast are curious creatures. In some ways, they act barely sentient, yet in others, they show a remarkable degree of organization.I have a few theories about that, but no real way to test them until recently. I've devised a method that will allow me to track the murlocs I'm interested in without doing any lasting harm or interfering with their natural behavior. If you're willing to help with the marking, I'll gladly pay you for your assistance."
362,"Saving Princess Stillpine : Help me, <name>! The Bristlelimb captured me and are planning to sacrifice me to their foul gods!High Chief Bristlelimb holds the key that opens the cage.

364,"Airborne Again : We just got word from Valormok that we can't send anymore windriders that way unless we want them shot down by Talrendis snipers. We can't give up Valormok if we want a secure route to Ashenvale, so we're going in another way.The airborne priests have graciously offered to drop some people in for us from above sniper range. Head up to the military area and secure a ride on one of their planes. They'll get you there in one piece, and hopefully once you're there, you can resecure our windrider lines."
365,"Ashenvale Outrunners : Blasted elves! Dey knew right where to hit us!It was dem outrunners... I tried to warn 'em that we were being spied on, but no one listened. Now look at us - cooped up here like chickens!Never too late for vengeance, mon! Hunt 'em down and make 'em pay for what they done!"
366,"A Shambling Threat : Dustwallow is Horde territory, <name>. The humans may have their little island and their precious sand bar, but the marsh belongs to us.In time, we will surely win this stalemate with the humans. For now, we must master our own territory.

369,"To The Ramparts! : These woods may be silent but our enemies lurk behind every trunk. I've discovered many an orc with arrows in his back, his weapon still sheathed.It is treacherous here, behind the lines, but we could use strong arms and sharp minds down at the Mor'shan Ramparts. Kadrak is preparing an offensive from there - he prefers action to talk. You and he will get along.Speak with me when you are ready and I will fly you there."
370,"A Not-So-Charmed Life : The furbolg covet that which does not belong to them.<Hephaestus turns the charm over in his hand and then discards it.>There's a property to the carving that slowly corrupts those that aren't trolls. As I understand it, the furbolg have done this sort of thing before. Some never learn.No doubt they hoard most of the charms in Thistlefur Hold above their village to the north."
371,"Spirits of Stonemaul Hold : Brogg has completed the totem that will put the spirits of his friends to rest. When the dragonkin came, they killed all Stonemaul who did not flee.

374,"Skull Rock : <name>.  The Burning Blade has infested the cave east of Orgrimmar known as Skull Rock.  Inside that cave they perform vile rituals, and burn their own flesh with Searing Collars.By wearing these collars, I believe the cultists attune themselves to demonic power.  But to confirm this, I must have a collection of the collars to study.Go to Skull Rock and gather Searing Collars from the cultists you find there.  Bring them to me, and I will uncover their secrets."
375,
376,"Flames from Above : We've identified the general direction where the infiltrators have been coming from, thanks to your work.Now we just need to shut down their camp and put an end to their operations this side of Nordrassil.Take this horn.  It will signal one of our emerald drakes to swoop down and give these Twilight cultists a taste of the flames they so madly worship."
377,"Break the Unbreakable : With the claw, we are ready to break through the Jadefire's defenses.Head into the ruins to the northwest. Beyond the frontline of the satyr you'll find a narrow pass heading to their corrupted moonwell.

Slay him once you are through!"

379,"Demon Seed : Listen <name>, we can't leave quite yet. I managed to overhear their plans while they were preparing for the ritual sacrifice.They're planning to use a powerful artifact called the Demon Seed to launch a full scale attack on the Horde. They're keeping it under close guard over in that cave.If you can get your hands on the Demon Seed, we should take it to my sister Nagala. She'll know what to do with it."
380,"Impending Retribution : Now that you've been suitably rewarded, I hope I can speak with you frankly.You've done my kingdom a great favor, but you've also unbalanced a fragile peace process.I was pursuing my brother's release strictly through diplomatic means in order to avoid bloodshed.Now, the enemy is sure to seek retaliation.Speak to Nomarch Teneth at the Tahret Grounds to the east, Sun Priest Asaris at the Seal of the Sun King to the north and Asaq at Mar'at to the west.  Find out where the enemy will strike."
381,"Lycanthoth the Corruptor : I think I understand what's happening here. The Twilight's Hammer fears that the ancients may someday rise up to oppose them. They'll do anything to stop the return of Goldrinn.This ""Lycanthoth"" is a twisted version of our beloved wolf god, summoned by the Twilight's Hammer to replace him.Bah!

384,"Timbermaw Hold : Okay, I know this is a longshot, but I figure it never hurts to ask.While I deal with the fallout of all the ridiculous nonsense that just went on here, I need you to go speak to some bears. The Timbermaw furbolg control the forests to the northeast, and they're not too fond of us.I just need someone to give them the idea the Horde isn't all that bad. Head northeast up the road to Timbermaw Hold--don't go into Felpaw Village--and ask the furbolg outside if they have any favors they'd like done."
385,"Are We There, Yeti? : My friends are always coming up with great ideas. I've never felt like I could match them... until today! I just drew up the plans for something great! If you promise not to tell, I'll let you in on the secret... I'm going to make a mechanical yeti! Not only are my friends sure to be freaked out when they see it, but when they get over that, I know they'll be impressed!I need thick yeti fur from the Ice Thistle yeti.

There must be a twilight presence behind our lines that we haven't accounted for.It's possible that whoever is instigating the elemental disturbance is using foul magic to hide themselves from our sight.Seek the aid of the faerie dragons that roam near the World Tree; they can see through any of our enemy's illusions.Feed them the juniper berries that grow nearby to gain their trust."
388,"Warmth of the Sun : The desert nights in Uldum can get awfully cold. I fear for our little egg's ability to withstand these temperatures.  These Amathet to the East seem to have mastered the harnessing of the sun's energy. If we could borrow some of their expertise, we could use it to keep the egg nice and cozy.  Keep your eyes open for something we can use."
389,"An Ancient Reborn : I'm convinced that YOU are the herald of Aviana, <name>. It was you who first saw her and rescued her essence from the claws of a dragon.Yes, I believe Aviana is to be reborn into our world.

392,"Runaway Shredder! : I've been trying to impress our new Horde allies with our legendary goblin efficiency, but in hindsight automating the shredders was a bad idea. Now they're mindless killing machines, rampaging over the countryside. Don't get me wrong - that kind of thing has its place - but for the time being I need a brave <class> to help me get these things under control.It's easy. Automated shredders, like all machines, must first be beaten into submission. Afterwards, seize the controls and I'll radio you instructions."
393,"A Lost Companion : Please help... I can barely sit up.My friend, a bear named Grimclaw, he's not here. I sent him ahead to let the Sentinels know we were coming before we left Auberdine, but he never arrived. I sensed something might be amiss as we were leaving, but with the evacuation, I never had a chance to act on it.If he's injured, there's only one place that he would go - the Withering Thicket, north of Auberdine, down the road to the south from here. Bring him back to me safely... he's my only family."
394,"Dousing the Flames of Protection : The braziers are spread throughout Shadow Hold.Enter the tunnel into Shadow Hold, and follow it through the underground passageways. Douse each of the brazier's flames and the protections the Council has set up will fall for at least a short period of time."

So Darla says if you can muster up out of that cave you're in and beat that elemental, she's got a mighty fine prize in store for ya!"
396,"Je'neu of the Earthen Ring : The Earthen Ring is a shamanistic group dedicated to studying and preserving the elements.  They have forgotten more about crazy old gods, ancient legends and lore than most scholars will ever know.Lucky for you, I know someone in the Earthen Ring here in Ashenvale.  Head over to Zoram'gar Outpost on the coast of the Zoram Strand; show Je'neu Sancrea what you found.  If anyone can figure out that globe's significance, it'd be him."

Fetch my treasure and I'll split it with you!"

I plan to hunt these demons to the ends of Azeroth, and your kind will be the arrow I shall loose upon them.Tell your Illidari within Orgrimmar to make ready to serve the Horde.But make no mistake, your kind once served the Betrayer. Betray me, and there is no world you can run to that will save you from my vengeance."

411,"A Shameful Waste : Welcome to Forest Song, <class>. Where you see tents, there will one day be buildings, but such ambition requires a steady stream of materials. I cannot bring myself to order our workers to fell any of the ancient trees of this grove, but our neighbors to the west have no such reverence for the forest.We shall reclaim the tainted wood from Satyrnaar to the west. Take the wood to Gnarl at the Warsong Lumber Camp. He is an Ancient who will purify it for our use."
412,"The Ancients' Ire : Come to join the offensive? If you're looking for Sandrya Moonfall, she's leading the attack on the Shatterspear leader at the cave in the back of the vale, you can meet her there.While you're here though, we could certainly use your help with routing the rest of their tribe.

He will be pleased that such a weapon has been removed from the enemy's arsenal.

Venomhides are vicious and must be trained from the moment they hatch.If you want to ride one, you'll need an unhatched egg. Scattered throughout the Marshlands are a number of ravasaur nests.

They are somewhat like fel cones, but quite a bit more potent.

Use the ireroot seeds to route them before they become a more serious threat."

Wait until they catch a fish, then get the sample quickly and get away before they finish eating.Please do not harm any of them."

Let the meeting finish then return to me with the identity of the scoundrel."

And he has... considerable influence with the shardtooth females.He is my kind of bear.I want to eat him.His cave is near the maulers. Good luck!"
432,"Gorishi Grub : The venomhide hatchling looks at you expectantly, then begins to scrawl a pictogram into the dirt.The hatchling's drawings seem to resemble various types of large insects, perhaps the gorishi silithids. The hatchling finishes his picture, then gestures at it with one short arm, snaps its jaws, and licks its lips.It must want you to go to the Slithering Scar, in the center of the southern part of Un'Goro Crater, and gather silithid meat. When you have the meat, feed it to your hungry hatchling."
433,"Help for Mudsprocket : When that goblin... what's her name... Boxie, Foxy... Moxie, that's it! Anyway, when she came through here on her way to the zeppelin wreck, she said the town of Mudsprocket was having some problems.That crashed zeppelin was bringing them fresh supplies. If you follow the road south from here, past the Stonemaul Ruins, you'll eventually come to Mudsprocket.Why don't you check in with Drazzit Dripvalve down there and see if there's anything you can do to help?"

Forgemaster Pyrendius has personally crafted many of the cursed weapons that Twilight's Hammer is using in their conquest of the realms above.Before we leave these lands of flame...

453,"The Karnitol Shipwreck : Intriguing.Well, we might not be without hope quite yet.Along that same coast, but to the north near Ranazjar Isle, there're night elf ruins at the bottom of the ocean. A tribe of naga, the Slitherblade, make that their home. I think that'd be our best bet.If a scouting party went that far south, then they must've been pretty powerful. If you're gonna find Karnitol's belongings, I'd start with the more powerful naga: the tidehunters or sea witches."

In the Alliance tongue, he is known as ""Goldrinn.""I don't need to tell you how important the wolf god has been to the Horde - his tenacity under adversity has been an inspiration to all of our disparate races.Southwest of here, down in the valley, lies a shrine to Goldrinn.

462,"Kodo Roundup : Bibbly thinks he is the only goblin in Desolace who knows how to make money.  Well, the only caravan brave enough to travel these parts relies on me.  Ever since I learned how to rejuvenate and control aged kodos with my kodo kombobulator, the caravan owner Cork, Rigger, and I entered a partnership.Take the kombobulator and use it on any ancient or aged kodos; it will jolt the beast into a tamed kodo and force it to follow you.  Once you have a kodo tamed, bring it back to me."

Corruption permeates the camp, and I wish to put an end to it before they become a problem.The Deadwood tribe is evil, but it is the effects of the fel that pollutes their minds.  Their hostility is not truly an innate quality, yet they cannot be helped.  It saddens me that we must fight our own brethren.Please, <name> - I ask you to do what must be done.  Simply spare me the details; such troublesome images upset me far too much."
466,"Desolation Hold Inspection : Thanks to you, the immediate threat is over. But my work here in the Barrens is only beginning.Honor's Stand was captured and Taurajo was sacked while Warlord Gar'dul was in charge of the region. The Warchief has sent me here to clean up his mess.I would like you to ride into Desolation Hold to the south in advance of me and let Gar'dul know that it is time for a reckoning.Talk to me when you are ready to leave and I will assemble my vanguard to accompany you."
467,"Sang'thraze the Deflector : The blood speaks. I can feel its flow through the sand...drenched in death, a desert of suffering...<Mazoga's eyes roll back in his head.>There! The blood flows to the south, in a valley of bones. Zakkaru! Zakkaru, spawn of Makkari, the dark one who demands sacrifice... his father forced from Zul'Farrak, his ascension interrupted... he will taste blood once more...<Mazora reels.>Go, <class>. Zakkaru has Sang'thraze. Ya not be wanting him to keep it, trust me."
468,"Might of the Sentinels : The Twilight's Hammer? Here?This is far more serious than I expected. We've got to put a stop to this. I don't know if I'm ready to lead such an offensive, but I'm not about to let my fears get in the way of what needs to be done!I will rally our forces from Feathermoon Stronghold. Head to Dire Maul, make your way to the arena, and disrupt Cho'gall's activities; we will launch our attack during the confusion."
469,"The Reagent Thief : If there's one thing you can count on Apprentice Morlann to do, it's whine about reagents.Normally, I just ignore him, and it never works. This time, I'm going to try something different.Maybe if I replace the missing reagents before he notices, he'll leave me alone. The most common reagent we both use is marsh venom, which comes from the darkfang creepers and noxious shredders in the marsh north of the farm. If you bring me the venom, I'll replace it before Morlann notices it's gone."
470,"WANTED: The Demon Hunter : Since reclaiming Jadefire Run from the satyr, the Emerald Circle has sent many druids to begin the long task of cleansing the ruins. Last night, several of them were murdered... by a night elf.The witnesses say it was a demon hunter, a crazed disciple of Illidan. A rare sight. No doubt he's gone mad with power just like his master.I'll pay top bounty for proof of this murderer's death. He's been spotted just off the road to the north, in a valley beneath Jadefire Run."
471,"Winterhoof Cleansing : I have crafted the totem to cleanse the Winterhoof Water Well.  Now, you must take it to the well and perform a cleansing ritual.  The well is to the southeast, but be warned: whoever did this may still be there, laying in wait.This may prove very dangerous, <name>.  Be careful...but do not let the defilers of our well escape."
472,"Young and Vicious : Ya be a good one, <name>.Moraya was askin' for new raptors ta train. We shouldn't keep her waitin' any longa! I have a few other recruits bringin' some over as well, but I have a special one dat I've been promisin' Moraya for a while.Swiftclaw be one of our fastest and bravest young raptors yet, but he can be a bit unruly. I'll lend ya da lasso, I just need ya to catch him somewhere on da island here and steer him over to da pens on da main isle. I doubt he'll be makin' it easy on ya though."
473,"The Escape : I suppose I'll learn as we go... Couldn't be too hard. Just some buttons here, and a lever or two... Well, are you ready to go?"
474,"We All Scream for Ice Cream... and then Die! : Don't get me wrong... I'm cheerful on the outside, but inside I'm just terribly torn to pieces. All of my friends and employees are dead.Could you do me a favor? Would you swim down there and attach the tug's tow hook to my dead employees? I'll reel them in."
475,"A Favor for the Furrier : The commander can be most generous to those who demonstrate their loyalty, and I know of something that you can do to curry favor with him.Before building up his... ehh... workforce, he dealt in the furs of animals.He is quite skilled in the art of leatherworking. The furrier can do wonders with even the most tattered pelts.The dried oasis to the east is said to be home to a rare breed of coyote.Their furs would make a very thoughtful gift."
476,Learn to Ride in Mulgore : This pamphlet advertising riding training and mount purchases was sent from Kar Stormsinger.Kar can be found in Mulgore's Bloodhoof Village.
477,Flamebreaker : The large elementals that besiege us are not a singular entity.They are an amalgamation of lesser spirits bound together by the Twilight's Hammer cultists' magic.The rebuilt flameseer's staff will give us enough power to shatter its bonds.Destroy the smaller elementals once you've broken up the more dangerous large ones.
478,"Warchief's Command: Desolace! : All able bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Furien at Tethris Aran in Desolace. The brave Horde warriors of Desolace need your help to beat back the armies of the Alliance and ancient demons.To reach Tethris Aran, travel south from the Charred Vale in the Stonetalon Mountains.Destiny calls!"
479,"Wave One : Here they come, <name>! The Twilight Knight Riders, astride black buzzards birthed in the scorching sulfurous breeding pools of the Firelands. The only way to defeat them is from the sky!Take wing once more, <class>, and slay them.Run into enemy riders with your lance to destroy them.Go forth. Fly, fool. Fly!"
480,"In Defense of Darkshore : Now that we know our preventative measures work, we should cover as much ground as possible.I've arranged to commandeer one of our hippogryphs, but I can't do this alone. Talk to my friend Orseus, next to the flight master right outside the grove here. Let him know when you're ready and I'll meet you there. We'll canvas Darkshore from the air and protect as many animals as we can!"
481,"Supervisor Fizsprocket : According to the documents you salvaged from the caravan, the Venture Co. created many plans to attempt to drive us from our lands here, so that they could have free reign to plunder our lands.The depths that they would sink to accomplish their goals disgusts and appalls me. I want the mastermind behind their plans killed. His name is Supervisor Fizsprocket, you will find him at the Venture Co. mine east of the ravaged caravan. Bring me his clipboard, we shall see if we find out anything useful."
482,"Grimtotem Chiefs: The Chief of Chiefs : And now the time has come to take out the leader of all of the Darkcloud Pinnacle Grimtotem: Arnak Grimtotem.It is said that he's the disgraced nephew of Magatha Grimtotem, the Elder Crone and matriarch of the Grimtotem clan. Supposedly, his indiscretions have left him in a state of disfavor with her.But none of that matters right now. All that matters is that we kill him. For good this time."
483,"You'll Know It When You See It : With his dying breath, Kohor mentioned the summoning of a demon that could threaten the entire region.He may have been bluffing, but that's not a chance worth taking.This cannot wait for the Alliance's invasion of Desolace to take shape. You must scour Thunder Axe Fortress for clues and bring an end to this potential threat."
484,"The Second Sample : Now that we have the baseline crystal, we're going to need samples from more dangerous areas of the island to complete the set I'll be sending to the Exodar.The next sample must come from the crystals controlled by the blood elves in the Bladewood area to the northwest of Blood Watch. I have heard reports that they alter and harvest the crystals for use in some magical apparatus. See if you can find one that has not yet been incorporated into one of their devices, and mine a sample from it."
485,
486,"Jarl Needs Eyes : Eye juice is good juice for drinking.  Too bad most critters only have two eyes.But spiders have lots of eyes.  Lots and lots.  And Darkmist eye juice is tasty.  Smooth and salty!  Unpopped spider eyes... I taste them already.Darkmist spiders are west of here, in the Darkmist Cavern.  You figure the spiders are named after the cave... or is it the other way around?"
487,"Angered Spirits : Doctor Venkman vas vone of my greatest researchers, until he had to be put out of my misery.He did leave me vizh vone of his greatest accomplishments, zhough. Against zhe properly attuned supernatural adversary, zhis veapon vill siphon zhe target's essence.It is of key importance in zhe ritual I vill be attemptink.Vhere do you come in, you ask? Simple. You have zhe priviledge of collecting zhe material.Zhe veapon is calibrated to vork on zhe Furious Specters in zhe temple to zhe east."
488,"The Fare of Lar'korwi : Once, a long time ago, a brother of mine took some meat from one of Lar'korwi's kills. He didn't know it at the time, but Lar'korwi saw him from the forest. Lar'korwi followed my brother for days, destroying everything he touched. My brother, scared, finally decided to run from the Crater and leave Lar'korwi behind.Lar'korwi killed him not far from this spot.If you want to provoke Lar'korwi, find a fresh kill of his and take some of the meat from it.Start your search to the west."
489,"To the Mor'shan Rampart : Kadrak at the Mor'shan Rampart to the north is calling for aid.The rampart rests on the border between the Northern Barrens and Ashenvale. It is the front line in the fight against the Alliance.We're driving the night elves out of the forest. We'll claim its resources for the Horde!To get there, take the Gold Road north out of the Crossroads.Destiny calls!"
490,"All That Remains : We had lived peacefully among the Owlbeasts of this island for many years. You can imagine my surprise when they stormed the beach and attacked us.I fought tooth and nail but was easily overpowered. As I blacked out from the vicious blows that I had been dealt, I prayed that my family not suffer.When I awoke, all was quiet. The sand was soaked red with blood - their blood. They were devoured whole.I care not for vengeance, <name>. I only ask that their remains be returned to me for proper burial."
491,"Eyes on the Amathet : On behalf of the Explorer's League, I'd like tae thank ye for helping establish the Uldum Accord and buying us some cooperation from Ramkahen.  In the interest of better understanding our foes, Ramkahen has allowed the exploring of the Amathet tombs. Unfortunately, though, their forces are spread too thin to provide protection.  I was hopin' ye could help out with that.   Think ye could spare some time tae see what they're all about? We can start with an aerial look."
492,"First Degree Mortar : Hey bud! Like explosions? Of course you do. Who doesn't like explosions?!I've got mortars set up on the ridge to the east to hold the naga back. Go forth, recruit. Mortar them... mortar them all! Ahahahah."
493,"They're Out There! : They're out there, <class>. And they're on to us.Some of my men have begun turning up dead. Elf attacks, no question about it.My guess is that your work at Astranaar has them desperate to stop our progress here. A last ditch effort to escape defeat!Take these goggles. They'll help you see even the sneakiest of the elves. Keep them off my back while we finish weaponizing your explosives."
494,"Speech Writing for Dummies : Listen, <name>.  I found out what they're doing with Jarod Shadowsong.  He's scheduled to be sacrificed by the ogres of the Twilight's Hammer as part of this year's initiation.I heard that the initiate charged with delivering the speech ahead of the sacrifice is an ogre named Okrog, but get this: you were a close second.We need you to deliver that speech if we're to free Jarod.  Don't worry -- I'll write you some cue cards -- just make sure Okrog has an ""accident"" as he leaves the Seat of the Chosen."
495,"Windshear Mine Cleanup : The Horde has overrun Windshear Mine. I'm not sure what these orcs are hauling out of here or why they're here, but I know that it can't be good. Get in that mine and take out the management. Without goblin overseers, these peons will be even more worthless.While you're inside, keep your eyes peeled for any other information about the Horde operation in the mines.Good luck!"
496,"Commandeer That Balloon! : We don't have a moment to lose, <name>. You're going to have to commandeer that hot air balloon and stop it!How? I have no idea! We don't have time to argue details! Grab onto that rope ladder and climb up! Just start banging on stuff once you're inside!If you somehow manage to stop the balloon and survive, report to Lord Fallowmere at Windshear Hold in the west.Good luck, we're all counting on you. Now if you'll excuse me I'm going to RUN FOR MY LIFE!"
497,"Siegebreaker : <name>, you've proven yourself on the Fields of Blood. But the Alliance still threatens our tauren friends.The siege machinery outside the gates of Mulgore is like a spear aimed at our heart. I want you to go to the gates, south of here, and remove those siege vehicles from play.Here, use these stickybombs. They're courtesy of our new goblin allies. It looks as though they stuffed explosive powder into ... what looks like ... grease-covered socks. But they'll do."
498,"Free Samples : The crown has ordered SI:7 to infiltrate the goblin mining operation and collect any information we can find on this mysterious new substance.  My agents have infiltrated the camp, but the clock is ticking and we need to get our hands on some extracted ore samples fast.  In other words, I need someone who can take the direct approach. Someone who can handle a fight against overwhelming odds and come out alive.  Take the ore samples to Khargus Stonemantle for analysis when you return."
499,"That Smart One's Gotta Go : There's some kind of smart brain bug in the back of the cave. It's in charge of all of the silithid down there.My ice cream is melting! How am I supposed to launch my ice cream empire, and save my inventory, if that thing's in there?!"
500,"Hard to Harvest : The Lakkari Tar Pits, just north of here, conceal a hidden treasure: rare flowers that grow at the bottom of the pits.  These tarblossoms, as they're called, are valued for their beauty and their durability.  It's been a while since I last harvested tarblossoms, so there should be some new plants growing at the bottom of the pits.  Grab some for me?By the way, good luck swimming in tar.  It's nothing like swimming in water."
501,"Diabolical Plans : The demon dropped this parchment, which is amazingly written in the Orcish tongue!  The ones mentioned in it, Diathorus and Gorgannon, are the two infamous dreadlords that control the demons hereabouts.The plans detail preparations for a demonic attack on Splintertree Post to the northwest.You're certain that Valusha at Splintertree Post would be interested in these."
502,"Terrors from the Deep : The Aqir threaten the livelihood of the Wastewanders with each passing day, but I have heard of greater terrors that have been unearthed with them.  Our fighters are able, but I fear what might happen if one of these ancient terrors falls upon us.   I know that you have experience putting down great foes. I would like to ask you to do the same for us.   After all, we can hardly help protect the forge if we've been decimated by some long-buried monster."
503,"Delivery for Donova : Donova Snowden is a kind dwarf who frequents the nearby hot springs. She claims to be studying their magical properties.She is a kind person and has good relations with our tribe. As the Winterfall have become more and more aggressive, she has begun researching the cause of their corruption.I must keep my post here, but I have made a basket of refreshments for her. Please take it to her for me and tell her we await her next visit."
504,"Two If By Boat : Are you ready to go, <class>?One of our braves will row you out to the Mirage Raceway. If anyone has survived out there, they'll desperately need your help.May the Earth Mother smile upon you."
505,"The Twilight Mystery : A camp of Twilight's Hammer cultists once thrived northwest of here.  If you were to venture there now, you'd find the area swarming with elementals and nothing but scattered pieces of wood and canvas to mark the spot where the camp was.I've recovered a few fragments of a clay tablet from the site, but I have too few of them to piece together anything useful.  See if you can find the remaining tablet fragments so we can shed some light into the Twilight's Hammer presence here in Silithus."
506,"The Shaper's Terrace : <As you look into the orb in front of you, you hear a voice.>The crystal pylons have been activated.  A sufficient number of crystals have been gathered.  The prerequisites have been met.  We are prepared for teleport to The Shaper's Terrace.Speak to me when you are ready, <race>.  We will consult with The Watcher."
507,Meetup with the Caravan : The pyramid inside of the Maker's Terrace in Uldum can be used as some kind of super weapon that will end all life on Azeroth.<Belloc thinks a moment.>You must continue the good research that you've begun. Head south to the desert of Tanaris. There's a caravan there that's about to leave for Uldum.Perhaps you can tag along.
508,The Name Never Spoken : Did my drought work? You spoke with one of them?Then you know what to do. The name of their elemental master is written on three firestones scattered throughout the Inferno. Examine each of these stones and we will have the name we need.Hurry! Your precious forest burns!
509,The Flameseer's Staff : A powerful artifact known as the Flameseer's Staff was lost during the initial onslaught by the enemy forces.  It was an ancient bone staff that granted its wielder power over the elements of fire.Its fragments litter the area around us.  Find them and bring them to Malfurion.  Perhaps the artifact's power will still be of use.
510,"Memories of the Dead : The runes on this ring you found are still legible: it was given to ""Kalytha"" when she was granted admission to the Academy. With the right spell or two, this personal trinket of hers is the gateway to her soul.Take the ring back to Lake Mennar. Kalytha's spirit should now be visible to you on the shore of the lake. Touch her and the ring will allow you to see the world as she sees it, forever reliving her final hours. Probe her mind, <name>! Speak to the others and learn the secrets of Lake Mennar..."
511,"Wasn't It Obvious? : Azuregos! Yes, of course. Troubled old dragon, but lovely heart. I don't think all the years of vagabonds assaulting him have done him much good. He's a mite strange these days.Not long ago, when returning yet again to our local Spirit Healer, Anara, I couldn't help but notice that her and Azuregos seemed to be hitting it off. I imagine he's still keeping her company.The portal behind me is probably the quickest way to reach her. It might sting a little though."
512,"A Balanced Diet : Now that our larva is hatched, we'll need to figure out what we can feed it to keep it healthy.   It would seem that the aqir are carnivores, but the only things I've seen them eat are... well... us.  Of course, we can't feed our little friend people, so we'll have to find an alternative. Perhaps we could substitute animal meat?"
513,"Sharptalon's Claw : The mighty hippogryph Sharptalon has been slain, with the claw of the felled beast serving as a testament to your victory.Senani Thunderheart at the Silverwind Refuge will no doubt be interested in seeing this trophy as proof of your deeds."
514,"Shy-Rotam : Time for the big kill, pal! Shy-Rotam lurks in the north, the largest frostsaber of them all.You should feel honored. There's no fiercer game for a hunter to match their skills against... and if you saw the cash I'm being offered by gourmands that want a piece of this fellow, your eyes would pop out!Once you've got her, head on back to camp. Don't want to totally exhaust our frostsaber population in one day..."
515,"Trial By Fire : I'd love to say that with the tides turning against us in Hyjal, every recruit helps our cause and so on... but to be perfectly blunt, most of you are nothing but a burden.If I had a copper for every peasant who got too scared when the cataclysm hit and now wishes to join our side... well, let's just say I'd be a rich woman.Fortunately we have checks in place to separate the wheat from the chaff.  Go and prove yourself to the fiery instructors below.  Hopefully you'll do better than the others."
516,"I'll Do It By Hand : Yes, this all looks familiar enough.Thanks to all the information you gathered for me, I'm sure that I can activate the mechanism. I'll just need some time free from distraction.As soon as I get started, you can count on that titan construct to try and stop me.That's where you come in.I don't need to remind you of what's riding on this. Take down that guardian!"
517,"The Gatekeeper : According to these tomes, one of Ragnaros' most powerful lieutenants serves as the sole gatekeeper to Sulfuron Spire.You won't be able to defeat him alone.Sound this horn when you engage in combat with Azralon and any of our forces in the vicinity will come to your aid.You must hurry, <name>.  It won't be long before the Firelord realizes what we're up to."
518,"A Talking Totem : The furbolg village to the south is the home of the Deadwood tribe, sworn enemies of the Timbermaw. They are corrupted and foul like so many others, driven mad by the taint of these woods.Something unusual has occured near the village though. Travelers coming here have said that the totem next to the road has spoken to them.I have heard nothing every time I approach it. Perhaps it will speak to you, <name>? Maybe you can find out what's going on for me."
519,"It's Time to Oil Up : Three things come out of Irontree Clearing: lumber, oil, and exhausted workers. The first two are pretty much the cause of the third, but I like to be efficient about things where I can.I've got our shredders working triple unpaid overtime, and there's really nowhere in the schedule for them to get maintenance.Use this grappling hook to nab some of the extra oil cans floating around camp and use them to oil up the shredders, would you?"
520,"I've Got This Guy : Good timing, <name>.Seems I'm not the only one interested in these obelisks, and these fellas aren't inclined to compare notes...I think I can handle this guy.Maybe you could take care of a few of his friends before they make their way over here?"
521,"That's No Pyramid! : That pyramid at the Maker's Terrace in Uldum is nothing of the sort. It's a giant machine that can be reconfigured for any number of uses.Deathwing was going to have the Twilight's Hammer turn it into a massive weapon!<name>, you have to take the portal to get this information to Harrison Jones in Stormwind. He'll know what to do."
522,"Peace at Last : I wish we had a way of letting James Hyal's wife and son know that we have brought their murderers to justice.<Captain Vimes produces a small wreath decorated with flowers.>There are some who say that their spirits will know, even if we cannot reach them. It's not much, but I'd like you to lay this wreath at the Hyal family monument. It's one of the stones in the graveyard just north of Theramore's gates."
523,"Seek Out Tabetha : The arms you captured in Blackhoof Village have not seen any combat beyond mere training exercises, which means the Grimtotems who destroyed the Shady Rest are still at large.To the south, in the heart of the Quagmire, lives the witch Tabetha. Though she is a human, she has dealt honorably with us and trained some of our mages.Ask her for assistance in tracking down the band of Grimtotem responsible for burning the inn. The Alliance must not be allowed to think we were complicit in the attack."
524,"More Than Illness : We've found a brood of dragon whelps gathered off the road to the north, and they show the same illness as the stags.Green dragons are not simple beasts of nature, but the very guardians of the wild. They are magical creatures, and to see them ill as well implies this is a dangerous threat.We must stop this from spreading further through any means. Slay the infected whelps, <name>, and return to me."
525,"Ending the Threat : Their leader and his guard are before us. My Sentinels are ready to take care of his guard, we only awaited this arrow to seal their leader's fate.Let me know when you are prepared to attack. As soon as my Sentinels engage, I will shatter the leader's shield, and we will assault him together. Strike swiftly and we can rout this threat to our lands here and now.We await only you - speak to me when ready."
526,"Runecloth : In Timbermaw, we are content.  We do not like strangers.  This is good for us, but it is bad for trade.Not long ago, a rare night elf friend came to Timbermaw and she wore a runecloth cloak.  runecloth is rare among us, but the cloak was so fine my people want me to make more runecloth clothing.Will you bring me runecloth?  If you bring me enough, then I will give you something in trade."
527,"An Ounce of Prevention : Are you familiar with the Old Ones, <name>? Onu and I agree that the artifact you found in the lake can only be their work, and it's devouring Darkshore. Something is stirring up terrors we thought dead long ago. This is bigger than you or me, but my first concern is protecting the wildlife.Here, this sapling contains the life essence you gathered for me. I believe it can protect the local fauna. Test it out on a nearby un-consumed bear, stag, or moonstalker, and let me know what happens!"
528,"Intelligence Warfare : I am convinced the Alliance is using spies to scout the field and pass along information. They knew to strike at Taurajo while the hunters were afield. And they countered every one of Gar'dul's moves like he was an open book.Well <name>, I for one will not be outplayed. Not here. We will win the battle for intelligence.Even now I hear reports of Alliance operatives slinking around in the shadows, especially here, outside these very walls. Kill them and bring me back something of use."
529,"The Befouled Element : The slain elemental has produced an intensely glowing globe of water.  The contents of the globe are, at best, disgusting.  It would be safe to assume that whatever has befouled the water of Mystral Lake is most likely present in the water of the globe.It's not exactly common knowledge who might be interested in such a find; perhaps Mastok Wrilehiss at Splintertree Post, might have an idea."
530,"A Bird of Legend : Local legend tells of a mighty owl that circles the mountaintops like death on wings.  They named her Deathwing.Soon afterwards, they were told that that name was already taken.  So they settled on a moniker that evoked a similar sense of horror and dread:Hell-Hoot.Hell-Hoot can be found atop the mountain to the southwest of our smoking pit.  Silence the infernal nocturnal... so we can eat her!"
531,"Dead Man's Chest : Well gosh, as you can plainly see there's this really big battle with these pirates here going on. We're doing our best to make sure they never bother Gadgetzan or our new gnomish homes there ever again!By killing them.So how about helping us? We really wanna make sure we kill more than green-nose over there and her awful thugs. I'd really appreciate it!"
532,"Digsite Status : The patrol's been quiet today. And that's got me worried, <name>.Ever since the Alliance sacked Taurajo, none of our positions are secure. You look like you can handle yourself - can you scout around for me?Check in with my son Marley outside the Bael Modan excavation, southeast of here. The site's exposed and susceptible to raids, and my son's too proud to signal for help if he needs it."
533,"Futile Resistance : <name>, I certainly don't want to deliver my report to Commander Singleton without at least a little bit of good news. We've got to wrestle control of these roads back from these Horde holdouts.From what we can gather, Kona Thunderwalk is the name of the ringleader. He's got a camp just north of here. A Stonetalon native, he knows these roads better than his own hide. If we can wipe him out, resistance from the west might vanish.Find and kill Kona Thunderwalk, then report to Commander Singleton!"
534,"Too Far Gone : Yes, I speak your tongue, <race>.We furbolg have been through this kind of corruption before. Not long ago our leader stole the Idol of Remulos. The demon-tainted thing ensorcelled the entire tribe and our redemption was barely delivered by a druid known as Broll Bearmantle.But this time, we did not steal. The trolls of Zoram'gar gave us the charms as a sign of friendship. A deadly friendship it would seem.Our chief, Dal Bloodclaw, is too far gone. Enter the hold and return with his charms."
535,"Dolanaar Delivery : Greetings, young <class>.  Can you offer me aid?  I have a package of herbs that I must deliver to the town of Dolanaar.  But I still have business with the druids of Shadowglen and cannot yet leave.Can you deliver this package for me?  It must be sent to Innkeeper Keldamyr, at the Dolanaar inn.  It lies along the road, to the south."
536,"The Corruption's Source : I rushed here as soon as I heard the news from Wizbang. I know who's behind this mess now. Zenn Foulhoof.He came over from Teldrassil after he was chased out for performing perverse magics. The kinds of corruption he employs are not welcome among my people, and it seems he's taken it a step further this time, perhaps as some form of revenge.Zenn's been given too many chances, it's time we remove this threat to all that is natural. Kill Zenn and his minions, and then find me back in Lor'danel."
537,"The Darkscale Warlord : If the naga want to throw in their lot with the Twilight's Hammer, then may Elune have mercy on them.Go into their lair in the island of Nazj'vel and find their leader, the naga warlord known only as Wrathspine.Perhaps the horn of the ancients can still be saved."
538,Honing Instincts : It looks like our little friend is anxious and ready to practice more combat.  Would you care to show him the ropes?
539,"Clap 'Em In Irons : Our policy of conscripting non-violent criminals from the Stormwind Stockades has come back to haunt us, <name>. Some of my less-scrupulous soldiers broke ranks after our victory in Taurajo and are looting the remains of the city.This is a breakdown in discipline. Worse, the desecration of their homes only spurs the enemy to fight harder when our ultimate goal should be peace.Take these manacles and bring the Taurajo looters to justice. Speak to them first, but you may need force to subdue them."
540,"Thunderdrome: Sarinexx! : I hope you're ready for the next one, <name>. One mistake could mean instant, painful death! But that's what the people pay to see, isn't it?I hope you're not afraid of bugs..."
541,"Free the Pridelings : The trappers are rounding up all of the young wind riders. <name>, will you go out there and free the pridelings?"
542,"Three Princes : The Gelkis reside in southwest Desolace. They are just as stubborn as the Magram, and since they have not suffered war and relocation, they are considerably stronger.Humbling the Gelkis will require an extreme show of force.Khan Shodo and his three sons rule the clan. Shodo is aging, and suffers from old war wounds. He never leaves the depths of his cave. The strength of his rule lies in his sons.Slay them, and persuade the Khan to commit to our cause."
543,"Aqir Instincts : In observing the aqir battling the Wastewanders, I have seen the newly hatched immediately join the aqiri assault. It would seem the need for combat is born into these creatures.  We should exercise this in our new hatchling, under your supervision of course. Take him out with you and show him how to fight our enemies.   He may not be able to fight for long, so don't call him until you're ready for training.  With luck, he will come to see us as part of his hive."
544,"Working the Bugs Out : Why high command decided that a silithid mound was the ideal place to build a fortress, I'll never know. Them lil' buggers are tunneling under our fortifications and setting back our timetables. We need to scorch 'em out!Take this here bucket of burning pitch and dump it on the silithid mounds right outside the main gate. They look like big piles of sand. Kill anything that comes out, but be careful, <name> - them nasties are likely to swarm you when you light those mounds up."
545,"Lost in the Floods : The recent cataclysmic events have done more than wash a few boats onto our shore, <class>.  The Southfury River has overflowed, and Durotar's entire western basin is now flooded.There are still people out there.  I've been searching for a while, but haven't been able to find anything.  Would you mind using my telescope and taking a look for yourself?"
546,"Lost But Not Forgotten : Today marks the anniversary of my son Kron's passing.  As long as I refused to admit it, I recognize now: Kron is not returning from his crocolisk hunt.I've been working on a project... something that will memorialize Kron's passion for the hunt.  It's a crocolisk-tooth necklace... rows and rows of teeth, suitable to be worn by only the bravest young orc.  I will place it on his grave.Kron was brave, but he was not strong, like you.  Will you bring me the teeth for my necklace?"
547,"Thunder Down Under : Our army needs water, and luckily the elements gave us plenty of that when the cataclysm hit.  The water that filled up the canyon to the southwest should do the trick.Unfortunately, the corpses of thunder lizards still sit at the bottom of the canyon, and their electrical discharges are a bit too dangerous.  I've got grunts that can lift them out of the water, but we need someone agile enough to attach the other end of the rope.  Are you my <man/woman>, <name>?"
548,"Grimtotem Chiefs: Isha Gloomaxe : Basic brave philosophy dictates that if you kill the leaders of your enemy's forces, they will soon fall into disarray. We are going to do just that, <class>.Isha Gloomaxe is the closest of the Grimtotem chiefs. We will test her and her axe, and she will be found wanting."
549,The High Priest's Vote : High Priest Amet's vote is the only one that is completely outside of our control.He will vote as his divinations tell him and nothing we do will dissuade him.I figure that gives us even odds either way.The only problem we face is that his clairvoyance has failed him ever since the barriers around Uldum fell.He will not cast a vote unless he regains power over his divinations.Take the stairs at either side of the Vir'naal Dam and Speak to him to see what you can do to help.
550,"Take it to 'Em! : We was lucky to escape, <class>. I'm not sure I'd feel right if we didn't take care of them ambushers.Hows about you git back up to Khartut's tomb and give them little buggers what fer!It's off to the northeast, just inside the entrance to Uldum if'n I recollect correctly.What're you looking at? I sure ain't in no condition to do it!"
551,"Shaping Up : High Commander Kamses has a special mission for me?Wait... don't tell me.  It's hyenas again, right?Very well, I shall do my best.Meet with me at the Sunwatcher's Ridge.I won't disappoint you."
552,"Through the Dream : Alysra's plan might be necessary, <name>.  I don't know how much longer we can hold off the cultists.Fandral Staghelm is bound by powerful spells.  He won't be able to escape you, even inside the Emerald Dream.Beware, though, for all we know the nightmare has spread to this part of the world inside the dream.Take Fandral to the surface and hand him to Alysra.  Let us hope he's more secure in Moonglade than he is here."
553,"An Offering for Aviana : Although the guardian of all winged creatures is no longer with us in body, I sometimes hear her voice in the whisper of swaying leaves.<name>, we ask much of you as you set out to preserve this mountain. Before going on, take a moment to reflect.Take this offering of nectar to Aviana's burial circle, a circle of stones just outside the main door of the shrine. Perhaps some time alone with Aviana's memory will help sharpen your focus."
554,"Last Stand at Whistling Grove : We might have a chance to beat these flames back thanks to your work in the Inferno.Still, more wildlife is threatened. Keeper Taldros ran north through the flames, to Whistling Grove.See if you can help him!"
555,"Satyr Horns : Heya! I've been traveling through Ashenvale, heading towards Ratchet, and decided to make a stop here at Splintertree. I'm always looking for an opportunity, and it seems that satyr horns are in high demand in Ratchet these days.After asking around here, it seems that the satyrs in Night Run, Satyrnaar, and Xavian all have the type of horns I am looking for. I'm no match for those satyrs... but you look like you might be!Tell you what, you collect the horns for me and I'll make it worth your time."
556,"Respect for the Fallen : There were two humans here: Feero Ironhand and Delgren the Purifier. They were members of a holy organization known as The Argent Dawn. Both fell defending the post when the Horde first attacked.I'm going to loan you my magical cloak. It was a gift from Cenarius that allows me to move invisibly.Find both of their corpses and retrieve Feero's hammer and Delgren's prayer book. Feero's corpse is in the courtyard and Delgren's is atop the tower.Beware, the warlock up there will be able to see you."
557,"Mist : The sabercat's fur is a distinctive gray color, blending into the surrounding forest. As she lays there, you observe that she is badly wounded, with deep lacerations across her back and stomach.She raises her head and gazes at you, bright intelligence shining in blue eyes. She seems to wish to follow you."
558,"The Eye of Twilight : The ogre clan across the lake is led by Gar'gol. I use the term loosely; Gar'gol has the intelligence of raw beef.So far as I can tell, Gar'gol is taking orders from a magical instrument: ""The Eye of Twilight."" He follows its commands unquestioningly.If we can sabotage the eye, we can cause unimaginable havoc.Go to Gar'gol's hovel and seek out the Eye of Twilight near the entrance. Study it. Find a way to subvert it. Ah, marvelous chaos..."
559,A World Worth Saving : We could not stand against them. Their warriors... wreathed in the sun's flames...  They want the forge... to end all...  Go... I will... endure...
560,"Where's My Head? : He's here, <name>! Captain Grunwald is a high-ranking Alliance officer from Northwatch Hold, no doubt here to coordinate an assault on Orgrimmar with his night elven allies. We have observed him entering the tower southwest of here. I want his head, <class>. I want to send it back to Northwatch to drive a wedge between our enemies!I've sent a goblin assassin, Slinky Sharpshiv, to the tower but she hasn't returned. Go find her. And get me that head!"
561,"Pre-Flight Checklist : This new engine is extremely fast. And dangerous. I'd use the word ""volatile.""That's the way the Captain likes it.Run back up the hill and let him know that I'll install this bad boy right now and that he should meet me at the construction site."
562,
563,"Death to all Trappers! : There's only one answer for those filthy Twilight's Hammer trappers! Death!Bring me their nets, <name>."
564,"A Disarming Distraction : The curse has taken over the expedition members' higher brain functions, but my calculations reveal their suppressed adolescent subconscious can still be stimulated by realistic imagery.Utilize this holo-projector to distract them.They are currently setting up explosives at the tomb to the east to attempt to gain access to secret passages in Uldum.They seek dangerous re-origination technology beneath Uldum and must be stopped."
565,"Bloodied Sentinel's Glaive : The glaive rests inches from the sentinel's outstretched fingertips. Her eyes stare, sightless, at the ashen husk of Teldrassil on the horizon.  Perhaps someone in Stormwind can tell you what happened here."
566,"Xylem's Asylum : Quite marvelous of you! A pleasure to observe. Much to study.Off you go now, retire to my tower. Joanna will get you situated. I shall open a portal for you."
567,"Take it to the Tree : Those mangy curs think they can just snoop around my site and get away with it? I'll show them...And what I mean by that is, of course, that YOU will show them. You and the small army of axe-wielding goblin hires I've sent to Talonbranch Glade.The place will be swarming with worgen by now. Just where we want them. Head to the southeast, join up with the rest of our forces, and let some fur fly."
568,"Silithissues : The silithid! They're bugs, <name>. Or something like bugs. They're not natural... and we built a fortress on the equivalent of an anthill.Take this burning pitch. It'll set the buggers on fire and plug up their burrows at the same time. Be careful when you pour this stuff on there - the silithid will come out in swarms!Look for silithid mounds around the exterior of Desolation Hold. They look like heaps of sand. Kill anything that crawls out."
569,"Chips off the Old Block : My mysterious benefactors gave me more than one task. The second task took me farther south, to the Frostwhisper Gorge. I was surprised to learn that the gorge's bridge had been broken in two, preventing land travel from one side to the other.In addition, the juvenile Frostmaul tumblers were separated from their stronger adult parents. I thought that I could defeat them in battle.I was incorrect. I was forced to run away in shame.Teach these tumblers a lesson, <name>. Fight them, and win."
570,"Ignition : I don't suppose Sputtervalve sent you? I'm in a bind here. I hopped in without realizing that I need a key to unlock the shredder's movement column. One of the other shredder operators asked me if everything was okay, and I panicked! Instead of telling him that I was missing my key, I told him there was some sort of mechanical problem.We need to get out of here on the double! Search the upper level of the derrick, Supervisor Lugwizzle should have a key for this shredder.Help me out here!"
571,"Retaking Mystral Lake : We could easily have held Silverwind Refuge from the Horde had they not taken control of our water elemental defenders on Mystral Lake.One of their shaman summoned in Tideress, an old and angry water spirit of the forest who befouled our elementals and turned them against us. With the lake and the Horde pressing in on us, we had no choice but to retreat to the spire here.Go east. Take the lake back so that we will have a chance to retake the refuge some day."
572,"Speak With Spraggle : My good friend Spraggle has been fretting about something for some time now.  I'd help her, but as you can see, I'm pretty comfortable right now.Could you check in with her and see what she needs?"
573,"The Weakest Link : They say a chain is only as strong as its weakest link.I subscribe to that theory and expand upon it.Rather than removing that weak link, one must... strengthen it.The other links will step up their performance out of fear of they themselves becoming the weakest link.In my army's case, our weak link has a name.  Salhet.You'll find him training near the bottom of those stairs.Start him off with something easy.  The hyenas on the hills to the west, perhaps."
574,"Salhet the Tactician : Ever since I was a cub, I've always wanted to be a general.I was eager to join the army.  But as you've seen, my combat skills are not all quite there.This is not the first time I've been sent to kill hyenas.  As a matter of fact, I get sent here so often, that I've befriended these lions and trained them to do my bidding.They are my soldiers and at my command they will slay legions of hyenas.  Watch!"
575,"Blood Theory : The land is not all that has changed in Desolace. Here, the wildlife has responded to their new environment in strange and sometimes exciting ways.I am particularly interested in the Rejuvenated Thunder Lizards that roam just to the west.I need a sample of their blood.You may begin helping me by using this jar of leeches on a few of them.Once they've filled on the blood of those beasts, return them to me."
576,"Cleansing Our Crevasse : I recognize this foul creation. It's a terrible disease that kills almost instantly, and in a most violent manner. Loathe as I am to employ such devices, I fear we have no choice here.As you of course know, the naga remain a serious threat to the region. The time has come for us to drive them back into the sea!When you are ready, Grimfeather will take you to the crevasse where they are preparing a violent assault.Use the concoction on the naga and their allies to make Desolace safe!"
577,"Biological Intervention : The energies unleashed here have surged through the wildlife, twisting them into powerful and unstable forms. If allowed to spread beyond this grove, these deviates will wreak havoc on the existing ecosystem, devouring local prey and driving out the weaker natural creatures.You must go and cull the population of the overgrowth. Return when this task is done."
578,"Parts-is-Parts : I've always wanted to try making an abomination. It looks simple enough, but you know how it is when you learn things from a book. There's no substitute for doing!First, I'm going to need parts. Lots of parts. And you're going to get them for me.No need to be picky: human, orc... it doesn't matter. Parts is parts.Just be sure the corpses you harvest come from the Battlescar, so I know they're fresh.<Calder presses a rusted, gore-covered bonesaw into your hands and smiles disarmingly.>"
579,"Exploiting the Situation : <Hey there, handsome!  I've had my eye on those big, beefy biceps ever since you stepped into town./What're you looking at> ugly?  I've seen you walking around Razor Hill, trying to steal MY men from me!;Listen, I've got something for you to do.  I hear Gar'Thok's got you headed over to Tiragarde.  While you're there, think you could find some abandoned Kul Tiras knicknacks?<Thanks sweetie!/Don't ask why> just get to it!;"
580,"After the Fall : Aww, that was nothin', really.Those statues were teetering as it was - just needed a little push is all.How about you go and sort through that rubble?I've got a feeling we're close to getting this all sorted out."
581,"Behind You! : The three leaders of the Bulwark are powerful and not to be underestimated, <name>. Fortunately for us, you now have a disguise to make you look like one of the Twilight cultists.You should put the disguise on and speak with Codemaster Deethuk, Commander Fastfuse, and Elementalist Starion each alone. Get them to turn their backs on you, and when they do, strike quickly!"
582,"Chasing A-Me 01 : Unfortunately, something's happened to one of my greatest inventions.  You've seen mechanical squirrels, yes?  Well, to get closer to the apes of Un'Goro Crater, I created a mechanical ape to blend in with their kind--I call her A-Me 01.She has been studying the local wildlife at Fungal Rock for several months, but she should have returned by now.  I fear the worst for her.Can you help me find her?"
583,"Raze Direhorn Post! : There's no scrying necessary to see the trouble my new ""neighbors"" are creating. And if this is the band that burnt down the Shady Rest Inn, as you claim, there's no reason to tolerate their presence any longer.Take this torch and raze their camp to the ground! You'll find Direhorn just to the north of my farm, near the road. You can't miss it, really, as the Grimtotems have done a splendid job of announcing their presence with those totems they favor."
584,"Shore Leave : We're looking pretty good here at this point. It's definitely been a pleasure working with you, soldier.If you're ready to take the artifact back, we've got a Gyrocopter ready to take you back to Bilgewater Harbor so that you can deliver it to Uncle Bedlam personally."
585,"The Chieftain's Key : Sniff... I'm sorry! I didn't mean to get caught! They grabbed me and put this chain on me and left me here! I can't move and my leg fell asleep and I'm hungry!The chief has the key... Chieftain Bloodmaw, the other ones said. He's in the north end of the camp.But hurry! Please! Don't leave me alone here!"
586,"Sandsorrow Watch : If you're looking for more work, I've got a line for you. I know an elf by the name of Trenton Lighthammer who's been obsessed with the sand trolls near here for years. He's dead-set on finding some kind of mythical sword made by them, and just a while ago he finally got a crew together to go to Sandsorrow Watch and look for it.Last I heard, they kicked the trolls out of one of their camps and set up shop there. Look for it to the west, near Zul'Farrak."
587,"Kill 'em All! : I want to see some dead goblins, <name>! Just west of here you'll find a whole warren of those little insects burrowing into the mountain.Let's see to it that they're digging their grave.Destroy them. Lay waste to their whole grubby operation. They've sown their own demise in Bael'dun, <class>, and it is time to meet the reaper."
588,"The Kodo's Return : The great beast rises slowly to its feet, the loose Barrens soil spilling from its revitalized limbs. Instinctively it trudges back toward its home at Grol'dom Farm.You'll want to check in with Kranal Fiss to make sure the kodo made it."
589,"The Baron's Demands : I'm bound fer that gallows fer sure, mate. That treasure's no good to me now...Unless I can use it ta buy me life. I'll make a deal with ye, <race>. Smash these manacles and I'll tell ye where me treasure's buried.Oh, me word is good, friend. I used ta be a real Baron, ye know."
590,"Do the Honors : It looks like all that's left to do is to place the orbs on the pedestals at each corner of this mechanism.We appear to have stumbled upon what may be the most important find in modern history.<Harrison looks at you for a moment, then hands you the orbs.>Well, go ahead, <name>.We'd have never made this discovery without you."
591,"Search the Bole : I wish your tidings were better.Raene is correct, I know about Dartol's creation and the treants in the area--at least I did once. They've become corrupted now, their nature twisted.To find the next piece of the rod, you'll have to find the key to open the chest it's in.The wooden key is on one of the treants northeast of here near the Felwood border, at the Howling Vale. Once you have it, look for a small glade through the tunnel at the vale. The chest should be hidden around there."
592,"One Shot. One Kill. : I was traveling to Lor'danel with an important message when I was attacked by the furbolg Marosh and his trackers. During the attack I was poisoned, leaving me barely able to stand. I can make an antidote, but it will take time before it is ready.I would ask that you defend me until I can apply the antidote. I will aid you with my bow as best I can.Should we survive, I will be able to deliver my message to Lor'danel, while you speak with Onaeya at Maestra's Post to inform her of this incident."
593,"See You on the Other Side! : Alright, <name>. We've bought ourselves a little breathing room, but there's no time to lose.Follow me!"
594,"Get Me Outta Here! : <You reach up to unfasten Kristoff's bonds.>Good! Make a break for the exit, and I'll follow.If we get separated, check back here to make sure I haven't been recaptured."
595,"Disrupting the Rituals : The firestorms up ahead are unbound elementals in the purest form - something I didn't think could exist outside their own plane. Only very skilled summoners could unleash something like this.<name>, head into the Inferno and seek out Twilight Inferno Lords. They've got to be summoning in reinforcements as we speak. Silence them... For good!"
596,"Victims of Corruption : Bloodmyst Isle was forever changed by our arrival. The Exodar's crash scattered debris all over the islands and I think it's beginning to have an adverse effect on the wildlife.Before I can be certain of my conclusion, I'll need to get a closer look. The crystals seem to have affected the trees the fastest, so it seems that the treants would be the most likely to show symptoms. If you bring me samples of bark from corrupted treants, I can begin my in-depth studies."
597,"Unbound : There are two very powerful elementals that the Twilight's Hammer have bound. They are using the bound Fury and Vortex to infuse Animus with a great deal of power.When Animus has absorbed enough of their power, he will explode. The rest of Thousand Needles and much of the surrounding lands, will be obliterated."
598,Portals of the Legion : Here it is - the Hand of Iruxos.Got it from one of the Burning Blade leaders myself.You must possess it if the demon portals at Mannoroc Coven are to be banished... which is what I now ask you to do.With the demon threat increasing we must close these portals to stem the tide of demons to this world.
599,"Warchief of the Horde : The meeting to decide the next Warchief of the Horde is about to begin.  The other leaders of the Horde have already arrived. They are waiting for you inside the embassy.  Speak with me when you are ready, and we will greet the others together."
600,"Timely Arrival : It's good to see you. I wasn't looking forward to enduring what Alanndarian did, so the rescue is somewhat welcome.I saw the troll leader before I was captured, and thought I had the perfect opportunity to kill him, but he's protected by some sort of magic shield. Morra needs to know before she mounts her assault, but first, we need to get out of here.Help me to the dock - I'll make my way to Lor'danel via water, and you can go back to Morra with the intel."
601,"Sethria's Demise : While you've been raiding Sethria's nest, messages have been flying back and forth between here and the shrine. Skylord Omnuron was at first reluctant, but I've persuaded my fellow druids to risk a direct assault on Sethria herself.Everyone agreed to my plan... provided YOU spearhead the attack.Take this signal rocket and engage Sethria on the far ridge. When she reveals her true colors and shifts to her dragon form, fire the rocket and backup will arrive to help you!"
602,"Wildmane Cleansing : Your cleansing of the Winterhoof and Thunderhorn wells is spoken among the spirits, young <name>.  The Wildmane Totem is made, and your last task lies ahead.The Wildmane Water Well lies north of Thunder Bluff.  Perform the ritual!  Heal the land of the Grimtotem's poisons!  Let clean water flow once again!"
603,
604,"The Far Watch Offensive : Pigmen running amok right on the border of Durotar? Not on my watch! It is as they say, <name>: The best defense is crushing all who oppose you.One of my scouts followed the quilboar after the last caravan raid, so we know where to strike. Kreenig Snarlsnout is the mastermind behind the attacks along the river. Crush him, <class>. Defeat him and disembowel his forces so that the attacks on this camp cease.Search for a quilboar-infested cavern along the river, just south of our stables."
605,"Unraveling the Mystery : We're on the verge of a breakthrough, <name>! The rubbings you recovered have allowed us to recreate the glyphs on this crystalline prism. They are apparently a means for the Qiraji and other unknown entities to communicate various messages to the silithid.Unfortunately, that is all we could get out of the glyphs. We need to find a way to unlock the messages hidden within the crystals.Take the glyphed crystal prism to Geologist Larksbane at Cenarion Hold.  She might be able to help."
606,"Butcherbot : I make my money around here selling animal parts. I've been perfecting a foolproof method of maximizing profit: The butcherbot!These little guys are programmed to harvest every scrap of usable material from the wildlife around here, on a case-by-case basis. He does all the work, and best of all, only I know how to get the goods back out of him.If you're interested in making some coin, take one of these guys for a spin. I need some glasshide basilisk parts; you'll find a bunch of them to the south."
607,Neferset Prison : Hieroglyphs depicting a chained Tol'vir mark the southeastern corner of the map.Perhaps Tahet was brought there when he was imprisoned.
608,"Hungry as an Ogre! : You meet some people out here sometime. Nice people. Met an ogre once. Ogres get hungry just like me.I'll never forget what he said. He said ""Mud big ogre. Me hungry. Go bash fishy. Bring Mud food. You feed Mud or Mud eat you.""So I got him those fish and he ate 'em up. That's when I started too. The heads are the best part, all soggy-like.Don't crush those heads now. It makes them sad. Sad heads aren't good eating. Get me happy heads and I'll eat them and be happy too."
609,"Unleash the Raptors : Now that we've got our raptors, our next move is to ""encourage"" them to attack the Grimtotems at Blackhoof Village to the northwest.I've got a leftover haunch of... well, it doesn't really matter what it is. It'll be your bait. Set it down on the ground in Blackhoof Village near the windmill in the center of the settlement. The raptors should take care of the rest, if their training took."
610,"Fresh Bait : I was stunned to discover that Twilight's Hammer had located - and imprisoned - the great turtle ancient Tortolla. As we speak he is chained above the murky waters of the Ashen Lake.Freeing Tortolla from his bonds will not be easy. But we will take it one step at a time.Head into the Flamewake and collect for me heaps of core hound entrails. I will explain why later.And beware of Nemesis the Usurper while you are there! His time will come, but we are not yet prepared."
611,Return from the Firelands : I'll usher out the rest of Goldrinn's followers and seal this portal behind us.The rest of our forces at Mount Hyjal will want to hear of this victory. Return to Ian Duran and let him know what we've discovered and how we were triumphant!Simply step through the portal to return to Mount Hyjal.
612,Don't Drink the Water : Our shaman claim that the elements of water have become greatly agitated by the pollution of the water source. We know that the Exodar's power core is lodged into the mountain to the west. It must be leaking volatile fluids into the water supply! I need you to get me more information.<Aesom points to a flask and nods.>You are to take this flask and follow the beach north until you reach the area where the rivers of Bloodmyst drain into the ocean. Take a sample from that location and return to me.
613,"Wings Over Mount Hyjal : <name>, is it true you're going to try to commune with the ancients?Southwest of here is the Shrine of Aviana, the matron of all flying creatures. It's the home of my favorite instructor, Choluna. I've never encountered one who was so deeply in touch with the spirits of this world. You could learn a lot from her!The recent attacks have isolated the shrine. But it's easily accessible from the air - look for the second biggest tree on Hyjal. Good luck!"
614,"Enemy at our Roots : The goblins are already upon us!We have tried everything in our power to warn the goblins to leave Irontree Clearing before we resorted to violence. As they turned a blind ear to us, we struck, and now rather than spare the forest they would lay down their lives for greed.They will soon know the full extent of our fury! The battle rages just beyond our northern gate. Join our pack in glory and slay any goblin who dares come before us!"
615,Thunderdrome: Zumonga! : Splendidly done! But you'll be fighting more than mere humans!Your next opponent's a mean one...watch out for his right hook. And his left. I'd be wary of his fists in general.
616,"Hacking the Wibson : It is true.  New expedition crews have arrived by sea.My scanners detect that they already have been afflicted by the curse phenomenon.You must hurry and go aboard the M.A.C. Diver.  The access codes will give us control over the fusion core's functions, but there is still a layer of security we must bypass.User <name>, I must ask you to hack a very sophisticated mainframe known as the ""Wibson.""Do not worry I will provide you with further instructions."
617,"Raptor Captor : The patch of swamp to the northeast is home to a particularly nasty breed of raptors. We've lost more than one unwary soldier to them, but I think we can turn them against our Grimtotem neighbors.Take this rope and use it to capture Bloodfen raptors or Bloodfen screechers that you've subdued. I wouldn't try to capture one of the beasts until you've weakened them quite a bit in combat. It's going to be quite a struggle."
618,"Reduced Productivity : Alright, <name>, here's what I've learned.There's a titan device deep in a place called the Halls of Origination. It's meant to be an emergency reset switch for all life on Azeroth. If activated, it will destroy every living thing in the world!Now, it's only meant to be used under certain extreme conditions, but if Deathwing is able to corrupt the titan watchers, he could use the contents of the coffer to trigger the device.Go to the Obelisk of the Moon, <name>. Slow them down!"
619,"Sealing the Dream : It is ready. Take this, <name>; a beacon of natural essence, blessed by the will of Ysondre.To the east, on the other side of the flowing brook, is Dream Bough. There stands the Great Tree, the tallest in Feralas, a sapling of the World Tree itself. A portal to the heart of the Emerald Dream sits in its trunk, and it is this portal you must seal.The portal will be guarded, but you must be brave. May the Earth Mother watch over you."
620,"Hero's Call: Dustwallow Marsh! : By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Calia Hastings at Theramore Isle.You must aid SI:7's Calia Hastings in uncovering the threats to Theramore, both within the city and beyond its walls. You can reach Theramore Isle by taking the boat from Menethil or traveling across the marsh from the Southern Barrens.For the glory and honor of the Alliance!"
621,"Rocket Rescue : When the water came in, Steamwheedle Port to the east was flooded, and a lot of poor goblins are still stuck there! Now those mean pirates are shooting at any boat that leaves the docks here.But they won't expect us to fly! There's a hot air balloon by the docks. We can use that, fly over to rescue the goblins, and take care of the pirates, too. Mr. Noggenfogger will be so pleased!Go to the docks and hop in the balloon and I'll be right behind you, okay? I've got to get some rockets..."
622,"Seaside Salvage : If we want to convince Mister Noggenfogger to let us move more gnomes here, we've got to show him just how nice we are! I know just the thing.Gadgetzan's under blockade by pirates, but plenty of the goods that get blown off the ships survive intact... they just wash away. Most of them wash up in the shallows just south of town.If you could go collect those supplies for them, it'd help us make friends! And it'll keep that mean goblin girl over there from taking them and selling them."
623,By Hook Or By Crook : I suppose he'll come around with some cold water to the face. What do you think he'll tell us?I'll secure him inside our livestock pen behind me here. I don't think he'll stay conscious long. Find out what you can about why the quilboar are attacking our farms! I'll leave the interrogation methods up to your better judgment.
624,"The Fledgling Colossus : If you're here to help, then maybe you can help us with a lurking threat.To the south lies the Slithering Scar, a quivering silithid outpost in the middle of the jungle.  You can't miss it.One of my scouts reports that the silithid are harboring a young colossus in their large central underground chamber, and once it is fully grown, they plan to unleash it upon Un'Goro!This must not be allowed to pass, <name>.  Find the colossus and kill it."
625,"Marshal's Refuse : A big part of making money is shamelessness.  You have to be willing to profit off of the misfortune of others.  It all ends up boiling down to one question: How much do you love money?When Marshal and his crew abandoned their refuge up to the north, they left behind lots of supplies.  This stuff isn't rare, or even particularly valuable, but it's there if you're willing to take it.  His camp is up in the cliffs, to the north.Oh, and be on the lookout for whatever it was that made them leave..."
626,"The Witch's Bane : In my years as an herbalist, I've often observed that nature will provide subtle cures to the most vexing of problems. I've read that hedge mages and witch doctors often use the smoke of an herb known as witchbane to draw evil from its hiding places.If true, this would mean witchbane should be growing near the shallow waters of Witch Hill. You should be able to identify it by its broad leaves and reddish central stalk. Bring me any of the herb you can find, <name>. It may be our only hope."
627,"Master Trapper : One thing about me that you might not know, <name>...I come from a long line of trappers. My father taught me, as his taught him, to master the art of trapping creatures in a most merciful manner.As any master trapper will tell you, the most important ingredient in an effective trap is the bait.So let's start there.Fill this bucket with the meat scraps from almost any wild creature in Uldum."
628,"Pulling Weeds : With such an abrupt change to the ecology, it is to be expected that some of the flora and fauna don't react as well as we'd hope.The uprooted lashers are a troublesome example of this. Roaming the fields to the east and south they are a detriment to the region and must be disposed of.While you're about, please deal with any of these pests that you find."
629,"Buzzbox 413 : Greetings!I'm helping Tharnariun here try to unravel what's been corrupting the wildlife in the area. I've set up some machines in the field that can analyze animal parts and possible corruption agents. If you can get me some good samples, we can get to the bottom of this affliction quickly.The first machine is Buzzbox 413. I set it up on the beach just east of town. I'll need you to gather some flesh from the nearby corrupted tide crawlers and bring it to the machine so that I can analyze it."
630,"Friends Come In All Colors : My brothers and I are being hunted.Our sire was recently killed and the black dragonflight seeks to rout those of us that still live. I'm here to find Azuregos and take him to safety, if only he would let it be that easy.Azuregos doesn't make many friends, and his taste in them tends to be a bit... unique. The only one I know of here is a murloc named Ergll. You should be able to find him on the coast northeast of here.Do whatever it takes to find Azuregos and send him to me.Please hurry."
631,"Twice Removed : We cannot condone reckless violence - it is not our nature. However, there are times when the consequences of avoiding battle are too tangible to ignore, as is the case with these naga.When the earth in the area shattered, a small section of ruins rose to our east. These ruins once housed those loyal to Queen Azshara, and it seems her kind have returned in search of something.Take this petrified root. You can use it on their fallen to raise ents to aid you. Deal with them and their leader swiftly."
632,"The Apes of Un'Goro : There's plenty of money to be had here in Un'Goro, you just need to know where to look!Apes may be common here in Un'Goro, but they're much rarer up north.  In Everlook, a gorilla hide fetches ten times what you'll get for it down here!I'm not going to send you all the way up to Winterspring - that'd be irresponsible - but I could use your help actually obtaining some hides.You'll find gorillas at Fungal Rock, to the northeast, near a waterfall.  Don't forget to check inside the cave!"
633,"Kavem the Callous : Kavem was cruel enough before the Neferset signed up with Deathwing.  His pleasure in deriving pain now borders on the insane.It is he who now holds the keys to our shackles.He dwells in the building next to us, to my right.Find him and take the key from him.  Do not hesitate or show him mercy.  He will slit your throat and think nothing of it."
634,"Avenge Furien! : This cannot be!My dear brother - slain by Alliance scum!They must be made to suffer, <race>! Find a way to bring them pain! I shall not rest until it is so...Furien had been researching ancient artifacts in the eastern regions before his death. Speak to Sorrem. Perhaps he can direct you in my brother's footsteps."
635,"Mossy Tumors : There is a malevolence growing in the timberlings. We are trying to find the source, but until we do...in order to keep Teldrassil safe we must cut down the timberlings who are beyond help. Those that wander Wellspring Lake to the north are the most tainted. They must be removed!Destroy the Timberlings you find there, and gather the mossy tumors growing upon them. Bring the tumors to me so that they may be burned."
636,"Sullah's Gift : Jonesy tells me you two need to make it up that mountain.Well, you're not going far with those troopers crawling all over it like ants on a carcass.Some of my friends were able to confiscate a bit of the enemy's hardware. It should make your journey a bit easier.Make your way up the ridgeline to the north, and you'll find it waiting for you.Good luck, you two!"
637,"Not So Fast! : <The Khan of the Gelkis clan stares at you with an empty gaze as you detail the demon threat and Leh'prah's visions.>It matters not to me what becomes of this land now. I have failed my clan and my forefathers....There is but one thing left in this world that might bring my old soul hope, and she's likely dead as well.My precious daughter, Kherrah, was taken from me by the Maraudine clan. If you can bring her back to me alive, I shall consider your proposal."
638,"Reason to Worry : These appear to be orders dispatched to the overseers at the ruins from a superior in the Shatterspear War Camp. Most of the document contains negligible strategic value, but a couple lines stick out to you.""We captured another night elf spying on our operation. She has been taken back to the camp to be tortured for more information. Keep an eye out for additional spies - we cannot afford for our operation to be compromised.""The Lieutenant will surely want this information."
639,"Wash Out : Delicious!Azy always trying to get his hands on magic artifacts. Said he was trying to make friends with that archmage person. Xylem!Xylem has LOTS of apprentices. Takes in all kinds, burns'm out, leaves them wandering all over. High turnover.Last one was last night. Headed over towards that big goblin tower construction thing, way west. Maybe he'll help you meet Xylem? Maybe Xylem knows where Azy is?Play nice!"
640,"Clearing the Way : Only the most battle hardened, noble and positively fearless of draenei will submit to Legoso's mission. The exarch will not order any agent of the Hand to take on the task of destroying the Vector Coil and dispatching Sironas. He refuses to send any draenei to their death - which is what the mission is: suicide...<Corin sighs.>My job is to soften up the Sunhawk defenses. You are to slay Sunhawks near the Vector Coil and keep the path clear for our champion - whoever that may be."
641,"Speaking Their Language : The quilboar are attacking because they perceive weakness. Strength is the only language they understand. So we will show them strength.<Makaba withdraws a large horn from his satchel.>This is admittedly crude work but it'll do. Bristleback leaders use horns like these to challenge one another for dominance.<name>, I want you to challenge the Bristleback champion, Sabersnout, to single combat. Defeat him in front of his followers. Blow the horn at the Bristleback challenge ring due south of here."
642,"Trouble From the Ground Up : Teegan's a fool to think the quilboar caused this sudden overgrowth. Look around you. I've been watching these plants bloom and sprout daily - each generation is more mutated than the last. This isn't tribal magic - it's something primal. And dangerous.The day before last a great druid passed through our camp. Seek out Naralex, somewhere in the midst of this jungle. He'll know what to do.And bring him some plant samples from around the overgrowth to help his studies."
643,"Harpy Raiders : Since you're here, <class>, perhaps you can help me with a small problem. The blasted harpies have been ravaging our caravan supplies for too long. It's time we slit a few of their throats and diminished their numbers.The most devastating attack will destroy a good section of their lower chain of command and then we can work our way to the top.Take out Witchwing harpies of any kind in the Northwest and bring me 6 Witchwing Talons. That should be a good start..."
644,"Gargantapid : No! It didn't work! I don't know what to do, unless...Oh gosh, it's worse than I thought! She must've been stung by the one lurking in the cave. I saw it the first night we arrived. Claws the size of a goblin. A tail as tall as a tree! We shared hushed whispers of it around the campfire... we called it... GARGANTAPID! ...hey, are you laughing? Stop that! This is serious! Chelsea's life is on the line! Please, I'll make it worth your while...just bring me Gargantapid's poison gland!"
645,"Mutiny, Mon! : Now for my favorite part of any mutiny: the killin'! For pirates, it doesn't matter who's supposed to be in charge, only who's in control of the ships. Anchored on the east end of this island is the Maiden's Dagger, Cap'n Garvey's old flagship. He left his most trusted officer in charge: Alicia Cuthbert. Once we take her out, the ship is ours, and so's the sea.I'll get the men onto the boats. I need you to board the Dagger and blow this horn from on deck - that'll be our signal to board. Yar!"
646,"The Voice of Goldrinn : Southwest of here lies the shrine of Goldrinn, a memorial erected in honor of the ancient wolf spirit and his contribution during the War of the Ancients.Our new worgen allies have been drawn to the memory of the wolf god - go figure! - and were in the process of cleaning up the shrine.I haven't heard anything from my contact, Ian Duran, in days. Can you fly down there and find him? I've got a bad feeling that Goldrinn's shrine is in trouble..."
647,"The Gordunni Orb : In addition to clearing out the ogres...Estulan mentioned something else about the ogres. He said the ogre warlocks may have some sort of orb, or other item of powerHe was terse about it, but seemed upset...he said there was ""no way they could be Highborne"", so I think he wants to know just where they got them. Bring me back one of these orbs."
648,"Totem of Vark : You no longer see unrecognizable symbology in the totems. The totem of Yor reads to you just as easily as your native tongue.The markings identify another furbolg den, due west of here. You are able to expertly decipher the language on the totem and know that your destination is Bristlelimb Village. Yor will guide you but if you get lost, you know that you are able to take the ancient elven road in the forest leading west to reach your destination."
649,"A Love Eternal : I would like to extend my gratitude for saving us. I would call myself fortunate, but my beloved, Anaya, lays long dead. I am alone and deeply troubled, and sadly, I require your aid yet again.Wandering the woods of Darkshore after my rescue, I found myself in the ruins of Bashal'Aran... where I saw the haunted spirit of my beloved.She must be freed, but I lack the heart to do it. Her spirit must be destroyed."
650,"The Fallen Guardian : Fandral Staghelm was kept prisoner here in Hyjal. It was the green dragon Alysra - one of my very own! - who was in charge of keeping Fandral secure.We can only conclude that the Twilight's Hammer has gotten to her. You must confront her, <name>. Destroy her if you must - I cannot bear to see it.She was last seen in the Ruins of Lar'donir, west of the World Tree."
651,"A Sacred Burial : Only the most valiant tauren are laid to rest at Red Rocks, our sacred burial ground. It is an honor bestowed upon the great warriors who helped found and defend Thunder Bluff and those who have given their lives for the greater good of their tribes and chieftains.But it appears a foul menace has made its way onto our holy land. A band of Bristleback Interlopers is ravaging the grave site and I am too old and past my prime to drive them away.They must be driven off with force, <name>."
652,"Out of Harm's Way : Luckily, when the infestation occured, no druids were slumbering in the western barrow den. It is still a sacred site to us, however, and its depths hold blessed relics kept there undisturbed for ages.While I am somewhat trusting of the goblin exterminators, I am also... familiar with the habits of their race. Please retrieve any relics you can find in the barrow den and bring them back to me so they are not damaged. They are within urns, nestled in the small alcoves throughout the den."
653,"Puddle Stomping : There's a big problem here! It's great that the ocean came in so far, because now ships can get to Gadgetzan. But now there's a bunch of nasty old sea giants encroaching on the town! I'm sure Mister Noggenfogger would appreciate us taking care of them for him.Don't worry, I won't ask you to do it just out of the goodness of your heart! Take care of them and I'll give you a reward!"
654,"With a Little Help... : Fine, I be helpin' ya. He not gettin' outa payin' me alimony that easy! 'Sides, there be the baby he had with me sistah ta take care of!First thing we needin' is the innards of his closest friends. That'd be his cap'ns.Go down there an' pay the three of them a visit."
655,"Dearest Natalia : My dear Natalia has gone missing.Truth be told, she had been acting strangely for weeks leading up to her disappearance. I had caught her talking to herself when no one was around on more than one occasion. She was adamant that everything was ok and that she must be allowed to continue her research.She was last seen heading to Bronzebeard's camp to the south.My soldiers are spread too thin, <name>. I need you to go to Bronzebeard's camp and question those dwarves."
656,"Meats to Orgrimmar : I have some choice cuts of meat that I want to send to a friend.  Her name is Gryshka, the innkeeper in Orgrimmar.  Will you deliver the meat for me?The fastest way to Orgrimmar is on a wind rider.  Take the meats to the Razor Hill wind rider master, Burok, and speak with him about transport to Orgrimmar."
657,Learn to Ride in Durotar : This pamphlet advertising riding training and mount purchases was sent from Xar'Ti.Xar'Ti can be found at Sen'jin Village in southern Durotar.
658,"The Last Stand : <name>, I desperately need your help! I cannot hold out forever against this demonic onslaught. If I fall, Astranaar is next!Please help me!"
659,"This Old Lighthouse : The old lighthouse out to the east hasn't worked for some time, but Babs Fizzletorque has gotten it into her head to get it working again.I don't know how she plans to do it by herself, but she claims that it'll make the movement of ships and goods into the docks smoother, so I can't really object. Drawing duty on the docks is really nothing to complain about when you could be on the front lines, you know?"
660,"Raptor Raptor Rocket : Shortly after my intellect was augmented, I bred with Subject Four in order to create a unique race of cognitively superior raptors. Subsequently, Subject Four neither called nor wrote: I have determined to disembowel him upon our next encounter.Nonetheless, there are enough raptor children imprisoned in this lab to provide adequate genetic stock for repopulating my race. Please release them from their cages and carry them to the rocket."
661,"Explosives Shredding : I hate to send you back in there, but based on your description of what's going on, we can't let them use all of those explosives they have stored up!It's too dangerous for you to try to destroy them yourself, but if you were to steal one of their shredders, I'm sure they're tough enough to withstand the explosions.After you've destroyed their explosives, return here with the shredder. There's no sense in letting them have it back."
662,"The Blood of Azeroth : Do the leaders of the Alliance and Horde even know what they're fightin' over?  This substance that is risin' up from the wound is the lifeblood of Azeroth!  We need ta heal the wound, not exploit it fer power! Azeroth is the only home we've got. We cannot allow her ta die!  I trust ye, <name>, and I know that yer voice carries great weight among the Alliance. Ye must reason with 'em ta stop this madness!  'Tis the only hope our world has..."
663,"The Writ of History : In shu'halo myth, the Rattle of Bones is connected with the Writ of History and the Drums of War. They are supposed to be powerful tauren artifacts.We must keep our eyes peeled if we're to find the other two. The writ will most likely look like some kind of pictographic scroll if the stories are to be believed."
664,The Stolen Silver : It's clear that these raptors acted alone to steal the Horde's silver.It's time to teach these beasts a lesson.
665,"The Northern Pylon : You've done us a number of favors, <name>... now let Gremix do one for you.  The attacks on Marshal's Refuge were terrible, undoubtedly.  They came without warning, and took no prisoners.  They were lucky that so many of them survived.A few weeks ago, I came across a crystal pylon in the cliffs to the northeast of here, east of Marshal's Refuge.  I think the pylon and the attacks may be related somehow.  Maybe you can investigate?  I'm sure someone in Marshal's Stand will thank you."
666,"The Moss-twined Heart : The heart of Blackmoss the Fetid is covered with a dark, oily moss.  In fact, the only way to tell this is a heart is from its slow, rhythmic beat... A beat that continues even now.Perhaps Denalan will want to see this heart."
667,"The Kurken's Hide : Take the Kurken's hide to Moordo, on the other side of the village. He will fashion the hide into an item of your choice."
668,"Still With The Zapped Giants : Hey pal! I'm still working on a variant of a gnomish shrinking ray, using superior GOBLIN technological advances in its construction!  In an effort to avoid inconveniences for myself such as death, I'd like for you to try it out on some of the sea giants along the coast here.  You should find miniaturization residue on them after you shrink them - bring me back some!"
669,"Brood of Seldarria : <The Gnomecorder buzzes.>Be very careful, <name>. You do not want to rouse that black dragon.Now, look around you. If this is a nest then there must be black dragon eggs nearby. Search the premises for eggs and destroy any that you see.Return to me should you find and destroy Seldarria's eggs.Goldrinn watch over you."
670,"Field Promotion : Commander Molotov sent word directly that you should be dispatched to our forward post. We're preparing to send squads into the ruins to rout the naga and recover the artifact, and he would like you to lead one of them.Get to the northwest corner of the beach and follow the path up to our forward post."
671,"That Gleam in his Eye : If you're looking for Harrison, you just missed him.He was going on and on about his latest discovery, and how everything was beginning to make sense.Whatever... he certainly wasn't making sense to me.I tried to convince him to stay here and just enjoy a few desert sunsets with me, but there's no talking to him when he gets that gleam in his eye.Perhaps you'd be willing to check in on him?He was headed to that big monolith, south of here."
672,"What's Haunting Witch Hill? : I traveled out here to pay Jarl a visit at his new home and it's been a nonstop horror show ever since! There's something seriously wrong here and I can't be the only one who sees it...Have you seen the ghosts and corpses shambling about Witch Hill? I've a feeling that if anyone knows what happened here, it is them. Seek out these risen husks and risen spirits in the surrounding area, grant them rest through combat, and see what you can learn from them before this evil consumes Jarl!"
673,"Meet with Feenix Arcshine : I just received a scroll for you from Orgrimmar, <name>. It's from Feenix Arcshine, one of the mage trainers there. He wants you to meet with him at The Barracks in the Valley of Honor."
674,"Ethel Rethor : We have plenty of enemies in this region without raising the ire of the Cenarion Circle.When we established our post here, we were asked to keep a watch over one of their researchers.Korrah was last seen at the tower to the west. Do be a dear and pay her a visit. It's been some time since we've bothered to check on her."
675,"Teldrassil: The Burden of the Kaldorei : You must now visit the moonwell that rests under the boughs of the Oracle Tree, far to the northwest. The first and most powerful of our wells, its waters are said to possess the very essence of Elune's Powers.Retrieve a phial of its water and return to me. I will meet you at the crossroads in front of Darnassus when your task is complete."
676,"A Small Start : I am Admiral Odesyus of Alliance Naval Command. Our ship was forced to port on your island due to an infestation of sorts. It's embarrassing to even talk about, but goblins somehow managed to stow away in the holds of both of my ships.Last night, while most of the ship's crew was asleep below deck, they struck!Stranger still, they took our navigation gear and jumped ship!They disappeared into the thicket, east of here. Will you go in search of our gear? It will make for a strong gesture."
677,"Death to the Broodmother : We've located the matriarch's feeding grounds south of the Ascendant's Rise.She will be extremely angry to have lost one of her drakes.  Place the skull there near the carcasses she devours.  If she's anywhere in the vicinity, she will come out and attempt to exact revenge.We will have a surprise waiting for her."
678,"Wisps of the Woods : I have toiled long here with the Denmother to spread the teachings of Cenarius and the ways of the wild. She has gained much of my trust, and in return, I have been allowed to introduce the spirits of the forest to her students. The company of wisps is a great honor, as well as a useful blessing.But now the goblins descend on us, and seek to steal the wisps for nefarious use. Please, prevent this blasphemy!Call the wisps back here from the western woods with this blessed branch, and keep them safe."
679,To the Summit : We are staging a relief effort at Westreach Summit for all of Thousand Needles. Shyn will lend you my wind rider to safely get you there. Speak with Kanati Greycloud when you land.You must go quickly if lives are to be saved!
680,"Find Gorat! : Gorat is one of the Horde's most adept assassins.The mere mention of his name strikes fear into the hearts of our Alliance foes.He is reliable, fiercely loyal, and - until now - punctual.Something's not right, <class>.Gorat's mission was to find and eliminate the elf in charge of this assault on the ramparts.He should be somewhere in the region of Fallen Sky Lake.Find him!"
681,"Ride to Orgrimmar : For just a few coins I will have a wind rider bring you to Orgrimmar.  When you get there, you can take Grimtak's meats to Gryshka.  Her inn is in the Valley of Strength.Speak with me again when you are ready for the journey."
682,"Never Trust a Big Barb and a Smile : Next, we gonna get some poison from the scorpions that be runnin' around here.  But don't you worry, Bom'bay's not gonna let you get hurt!Bom'bay's got a big totem that you gonna stick in the ground when the scorpion strikes.  The totem gonna suck up all the poison, and you gonna walk away still breathing.  Sound good?"
683,"Gobbles! : At last! Zhe time has come to set my Gobbles free of zhat nasty curse!Pay attention now, <race>, and stay on guard. Zhere can be no interruptions vhile I perform zhe ritual.Let me know vhen you haf secured zhe perimeter!Now, move it!"
684,"Elune's Tear : I'd hoped Orendil's cure would save Relara, but I fear it only slowed the disease running through her. We must find more powerful medicine! Thankfully, Orendil spoke to me of further remedies should his first one fail.Elune's Tear is a type of stone that rests in only one place: the remains of Iris Lake, destroyed by the eruption of Thunder Peak, northeast of Astranaar. Orendil said the stone will wash away corruption.Please, <name>, bring me Elune's Tear and pray it will end my child's sickness!"
685,"Kodo Hide Bag : The kodo beasts of Mulgore are strong and sturdy -- traits much respected among us.  If you are skilled in leatherworking and wish the knowledge to make a Kodo Hide Bag, then bring me supplies for my trade.Do this, and I will share my knowledge with you."
686,Power Over the Tides : Do not worry about me.  My wounds are deep and death will soon come to me.It is all up to you now... you must stop the Twilight's Hammer.The Old Gods they worship have granted them power over the restless water spirits... but that power is tenuous.  Channel Elune's presence through this orb once the elementals have been defeated.Use the power of Elune to banish the spirits permanently.
687,"Warchief's Command: Felwood! : All able bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Tenell Leafrunner at the Emerald Sanctuary in Felwood. The Cenarion Circle requires your help to wrest Felwood from the control of demons and other corrupt creatures!To reach the Emerald Sanctuary, travel north from Ashenvale and follow the road until you reach the sanctuary.Destiny calls!"
688,"Negotiations : <name>, great job defending the Speedbarge! I've got something else that I need you to help out with.I've sent Riznek and Trackmaster Zherin northeast to negotiate with the centaur survivors. Their Splithoof Heights is dripping with oil!I figure those smelly half horses won't know what they've got and we'll get the rights to pump up that black gold for a song, but I'd feel better if you took charge of the talks.What do you say?"
689,"Twilight Geolords : The Twilight's Hammer, an insane cult bent on destruction, set up camps in Silithus and perform rituals day and night.  We do not yet know their plans, but we do think they are somehow linked to the pulsing red crystals spread across the desert.Although their mystery may one day be solved, we must first deal with their immediate threat.  Go to their camps to the west and seek out Twilight geolords.  They are the heads of these serpents; that is where we must strike!"
690,"Three Friends of the Forest : Care to make a quick trip to the south? I've three friends that I haven't heard from in a while. With these strange tentacles popping out of the ground to the north, and all of the demonic activity, I don't dare leave my family.Bolyun set up his camp in the southwest corner of the forest, just to the northwest of that damnable Fire Scar Shrine. Alenndaar and Harlown joined him, so they should all be okay, but you never know.Thanks, <name>."
691,"Salhet's Gambit : Neferset City is too well defended.  The mountain next to it, however, is not.I've spoken to the ranger captain and he's willing to take a handful of his men and secure the strategic mountaintop.There is one catch, <name>.  He agreed, but only if you would spearhead the attack with them.It must be a small group, else we'll draw the enemy's attention too soon, but trust me... the rangers of Ramkahen are as tough as they come.  With you by their side we'll surely succeed."
692,"Up a Tree : Hold still a second, I'm going to bring your main buzzsaw controls online.Night elven snipers from Talrendis have been hiding in the trees, taking potshots at my workers. I want you to take care of those snipers... by first taking care of those trees. Look for Azshara saplings east of the main gates. Your shredder will know what to do. Chop to it!"
693,"Cruelfin's Necklace : Examining the crudely constructed pendant, you notice the crystal pulsating softly. Though it emits little light, you can almost feel the crystal radiating a sense of wrongness.You're not quite sure what might have possessed Cruelfin to create this pendant, but the find is too important to ignore. You should probably show it to someone at Blood Watch."
694,"Ready the Ground Troops : It was a bad idea to muster the troops in this festering goblin metropolis. Every vice that coin can buy is within arm's reach. Our mighty veterans are running rampant, blowing years of Northrend back-pay in a city-wide debacle.Can you make a sweep through the city and gather up any stragglers that have gone AWOL?My axebite warriors are unmatched on the battlefield, but I won't have them disgrace their uniforms while on shore leave."
695,"You Gotta Have Eggs : I don't have a very discerning palate, but even I can't stand the taste of those chimaeras that you'll find around here.  Their eggs, however, are a different story.Chimaera eggs are the richest, most buttery eggs you'll find this side of Orgrimmar.  Way better than boring owl eggs, and not as sulfurous as those weird wildkin eggs.I'll take as many of them as you can gather.  Head northeast, and look for their nests in the snow."
696,"Ancient Obstacles : I've studied the gate here for years, trying to find a way of entry that wouldn't disturb any of the ancient architecture just behind it. It figures a few overgrown earthquakes decided to muck the whole thing up! But what's done is done, and the entrance to Uldum is revealed.I wasn't expecting anything to come out of the ruins before we went in, though. A whole mess of golems are running amok in the valley now, let loose from inside. Someone needs to clean them up if we're gonna get in there!"
697,"Go Blow that Horn : That old, bitter centaur, Skycaller Vrakthris, mentioned a great air spirit that the centaur worship. To secure the Heights, the last step is for us to deal with this thing.I've seen them blow the giant horn at the top of the hill up there and an air elemental came down. It gave them orders and then dissipated.Go blow that horn, <name>."
698,"A Tale of Two Shovels : Hey wait a minute, this bone has pickax marks on it.  These aren't yours, are they?  No, I recognize this mark... this must be that blasted dwarf!  Gah!Let me step back for a minute and explain.  There's another archaeologist south of here named Durrin Direshovel.  He practices a reckless, devil-may-care brand of archaeology that offends even me.A priceless fossil, ruined by sloppy pick-work.  This is the last straw, Durrin!<name>, go put an end to Direshovel and his negligent excavation."
699,What's that Rattle? : Did you see that glowing rattle on the ground outside of Isha's hut?
700,"Nahom Must Hold : As soon as we make our move west in order to attack Neferset City, the enemy will strike us from the east, where we'll be weak.Nahom will be the first to fall, and if it does, Ramkahen will soon follow.A small detachment is there already.Get a briefing from them.  I want you to make sure that they hold Nahom until I can send more troops there."
701,"The Captain's Logs : Now that you've got that thing under control, let's gather up the lumber I was supposed to be collecting. Otherwise these orcs are going to build a catapult out of ME!Fresh lumber should be stockpiled all around the area. Use the shredder to collect all you can."
702,"The Devourer of Darkshore : Now that the creatures of Darkshore are safe, let's turn our attention to the artifact you found in the lake. I believe it's the work of a minion of the Old Gods. We'll fight these fiends using the very lifegiving energies of Darkshore itself! Take the Lifebringer Sapling to the shore of the shallow lake to the south of here. Wave it over the waters of the lake and it should disable that ancient artifact.Be careful, <name>. The artifact is likely to be guarded by who-knows-what."
703,"Deceivers In Our Midst : Now that you've had a lesson in keeping an open mind, perhaps you'd like to learn WHY I killed those druids.The answer is simple: They are not druids at all.Demons still roam the ruins, now hiding in plain sight in the guise of friendly caretakers. See for yourself...this blindfold is soaked in demon blood. Take it north up the hills to Jadefire Run and place it on your eyes. It will show even the most oblivious fool the true nature of any demon."
704,"Hunting the Damned : The first demons to set foot in this forest were infernals. Long ago, these powerful beings of stone and demonic fire fell from the sky to take this land for the Burning Legion.The charred craters of Shatter Scar Vale to the south are where these infernals landed, and many still wander there. They are fierce foes, and killing them is both a worthy challenge and a noble cause.I offer reward for those who join the hunt. Return here afterwards."
705,"Warchief's Command: Stonetalon Mountains! : All able bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Blood Guard Aldo Rockrain at Silverwind Refuge in Ashenvale. The Horde forces in Stonetalon need your help to drive back the Alliance invaders and protect our people. The blood guard will direct you to the border of Stonetalon.To reach Silverwind Refuge, travel into the heart of Ashenvale and join our forces by the lake.Destiny calls!"
706,"A Squad of Your Own : I certainly hope that you're here to help, <class>. The situation is as dire as it appears. To put it quite simply, we are losing!My girls and I are the last line of defense against the Horde, but we're not going to get out of this one without taking the fight to them. Up for a challenge?I have a small squad of sentinels that I can loan to you. Get them close and I'm certain that their magic arrows can destroy those wreckers and invaders.Speak to me again if you need replacements."
707,"Winds in the Desert : I'm Rezlak, one of Gazlowe's boys. Boss sent me to help the orcs here in Durotar. Things'd been going good except for the caravans. Can't manage to keep them safe! Makes my job a little harder, you know?The last shipment, which they PROMISED would get through, was snatched by the Dustwind harpies of...where was it...Razorwind Canyon?I gotta have those supplies! Follow the big canyon to the south, you'll find the ravine cut right into the west and east sides of the walls."
708,"Get Koalbeard! : If we're going to get those oil drilling rights, we need to know what the Alliance is offering. How can we win if we can't do them one better?!Their negotiator, Kravel Koalbeard, is up there talking with one of their khans right now. Why don't you head up and persuade him to hand over the Alliance's proposal?You don't have to kill him... we're not savages! Just rough him up a bit."
709,"Shipwreck Searching : <Hey handsome, welcome back!  You wouldn't mind running another errand, would you?  I'd be EVER so grateful.../You!  Stop right there> you tramp!  I'm not finished with you yet.;I hear you're headed off to the shore east of here.  The beach is filled with crashed ships, and those ships have gnomish tools in them... tools that I can use.<See you soon, beefcake!/Get cracking> missy!;"
710,"Margoz : One of our more useful shaman, Margoz, knows more of the Burning Blade's corruption.  He speaks of a cave called Skull Rock in the mountains, just outside Orgrimmar, that shelters a large band of Burning Blade cultists.Before you go to Skull Rock, speak with Margoz.  He is wise and his council is valued.He is camped to the southeast, between the coast and Drygulch Ravine.Follow his advice, but whatever Margoz says, <name>, I still want you to crush those cultists!"
711,"The Goblin Braintrust : If we could just stop the damned bombing from the goblins' creations we'd be able to launch a counter-offensive to take back Silverwind Refuge!It's been my experience that goblins are either lazy and unproductive, or too productive and end up killing themselves with their own explosives. Unfortunately for us, they're being motivated by the brilliant Chief Bombgineer Sploder.Get up to the Skunkworks on the west side of the refuge and don't come back until you have the Chief Bombgineer's head!"
712,"The Elder Crone : You have the code. Now all you have to do is head to the eastern section of the Bulwark and free the Elder Crone.Good luck, <name>. Thank you for all you've done."
713,"The Hermit of Witch Hill : The marsh seems to have a strange effect on humans. Some grow mad simply by living here.Anyone who has ever settled at Swamplight Manor has gone mad in a spectacular way. The latest owner, one ""Swamp Eye"" Jarl, is already showing signs.I don't completely understand what's happening there, you'd have my thanks for looking into it.The manor is at the eastern edge of the swamp. Trek east across Bluefen and past North Point Tower. The manor is in a haunted patch of land called Witch Hill."
714,"Finding Teronis : A friend of mine from Astranaar, Raene Wolfrunner, asked me to send a scout west to Lake Falathim. Teronis left days ago, just before the Horde attacked.He was searching for an item he thought could slow the furbolg attacks on our people--a rod created by a now-dead, evil wizard.Before he left, he mentioned a gem for the rod. Unfortunately, we know that the lake has been invaded by some evil force.Please, <name>, find my friend."
715,"The Front Line : Their forces are weakened, their supplies destroyed, and their subleaders are dead. It is time for us to take this fight to their home, and their leader. I'm admittedly still in the dark as to what spurred their sudden aggression, but perhaps we will find some answers on their doorstep.Take this arrow that Balthule prepared and report to Sandrya Moonfall deep in Shatterspear Vale to join the attack. It would be best to secure a ride on one of our nightsabers - going on foot would be dangerous."
716,"Thazz'ril's Pick : <name>, you are a dependable <race>. Can I count on you for another task?  Some time ago I was surveying the cave to the north for minerals, and I left my favorite pick behind. When I later returned to retrieve it I found the cave was filled with vicious beasts! Will you go into the cave, the Burning Blade Coven, and get my pick?  I left it in a chamber with waterfalls. My pick has a spell on it so you can see it in the dark, so you won't have to worry about finding it... just what's guarding it!"
717,"Final Delivery : Overlord Krom'gar sends word from the base. You are to get back on the Krom'gar hot air balloon and take it to Cliffwalker Post. From there, the plan is to unleash the payload on the Alliance at Battlescar Valley.You better get going, <name>. It's not wise to keep Krom'gar waiting.Speak to General Grebo when you arrive at your destination. He'll be able to brief you on the next course of action."
718,"Changing of the Gar'dul : When Bloodhilt arrives, I'd like to - ah - talk in private. Can you accompany me to make sure things stay on the level? This Bloodhilt is a, ah, he's a, he's a loose cannon.<Gar'dul tries to compose himself.>Meet me atop the northern tower and we'll talk with Bloodhilt together."
719,"Quiet the Cannons : Now it's time to do something about those darn cannons up on the bluffs to the east!If you'd be so kind, hop into your boat and cruise on over to the Southsea Holdfast. Up top you'll see a bunch of cannons firing down on us.Those pirates don't know squat about engineering. It shouldn't be too difficult for you to clog 'em up and make them explode."
720,"Raging River Ride : Enjoy your cut of the loot, <name>!I hate to share, but business is business. And that double-dealer Nozzlepot is guaranteed a 10% cut of this treasure. Can you deliver this to him at his outpost in the north?He's got a little research station upstream, along the river. If you travel just northeast of town here, Horton Hornblower can give you a free ride on one of his riverboats. Tell him I sent ya!"
721,"Sludge Beast! : Whatever is lurking around the Sludge Fen, it doesn't appear to be human. Judging from the remains around its tracks, it's also dangerous.You decide to follow the tracks down to the bottom of the lake and look for the creature's resting place."
722,"Twilight Territory : The demons of the Burning Legion think they can just walk up here and take whatever territory they want.  Sure -- the territory was previously theirs, but that's beside the point.We'll teach them not to cross the Twilight's Hammer.Head to the Gates of Sothann and wipe out the contingent of Horrorguards that roam the area."
723,"Ancient Suffering : You must be careful when you venture forth. Other spirits are bound to this place, malevolent and hateful ones. They've all suffered so much.None of what they used to be remains, only suffering and a will to live. We will need that will to summon the overlord that keeps me bound here. Please, gather the essence of the spirits, and bring it back to me."
724,"Flight in the Firelands : <name>, our enemy is using this grotto in the Firelands to prepare an invasion. We're going to hit them hard right where they live.But first, you'll need to get your wings. Flight in the Firelands does not work as it does in the outside world. Something about the dense, superheated air. You'll need some practice!Get a Twilight Firelance from the rack behind me, equip it, then mount one of Aviana's Guardians. Practice flying - flap your wings! Visit a flag placed on the ledge below and return."
725,"The Great Moongraze Hunt : You're starting to make a name for yourself, <name>. How about trying your hand at hunting?Back on Draenor, our greatest hunters would hunt a beast that resembled the moongraze stag of this region known as a talbuk.If you think yourself draenei enough, go out into the wilds and kill enough stags to fill your pack with meat.You will find them grazing south of Azure Watch. Watch out for their horns!"
726,"Cindermaul, the Portal Master : Twilight's Hammer is using these corridors, and others like them, to move supplies from the elemental planes up into Azeroth. In order to seal these passages off, we're going to need to know how they're constructed.Find for me the Tome of Openings, used by the elementals to open gates between the planes.Cindermaul the Portal Master should have one. You'll have to kill him. Careful! He's probably got some tricks up his sleeve..."
727,"A Destiny of Flame and Sorrow : My kind has always been hated for what we do... despised outcasts, accused of corruption beyond redemption.Yet if it was not for a demon hunter, these very woods would be the greatest stronghold of the Burning Legion on Azeroth. I speak of my master, Illidan Stormrage, the ""Betrayer"".See for yourself. See what occured here when Illidan was first freed, and the demonic forces of the dreadlord Tichondrius ruled this forest completely unopposed..."
728,"Sarkoth : <class>! I thought I would die out here with none to know of it. While I was hunting the scorpids of the Valley, I came across a particularly vicious-looking one. Hurling myself at it, I managed to inflict a massive blow to its claw before it closed around my leg.  I wasn't ready for its stinger though, and it sliced down and into my chest, cutting into my flesh and letting my blood. Please, you must kill the scorpid for me! My honor must be upheld! I fought it up on the plateau to the south."
729,
730,"More Than Expected : Ya definitely more den expected, mon. I'm sure dere's more important stuff we can be usin' ya talents on now. Ya don't need ta hang out with da newbloods no more.Head down to da village to da southeast and make yaself known. Lend a hand here and there and I'm sure ya make yer way up to sometin' more prestigious quick enough."
731,"Got Lumber? : Kadrak has just received fresh orders for our troops. I hear we're to begin offensive strikes into Ashenvale!I have far too few supplies to support an assault, and my shipment from Orgrimmar has yet to arrive.I am forced to  improvise, and could use your help, <class>.Speak with Kadrak and ask him for the reins to Brutusk. The kodo will take you to the Warsong Labor Camp. Once there, seek out Gorka and ask her to load you up with logs."
732,"The Twilight Skymaster : Twilight Skymaster Richtofen is at the Twilight Aerie up above and to the southeast. No matter what we do down here, if he's not dealt with, all hope is lost for Highperch.While Heartrazor is too injured to help you with the fight, he can fly you up there. The rest is up to you, <name>.Good luck."
733,"The Root of the Corruption : You might have dealt with the symptoms of our problem, <name>.  But I've been studying these foul beasts and the eggs are not laid here by them.The stream from the current carries their eggs to the dam, but whatever is laying them will be found upstream.Go northeast, to the river's main source, and deal with the root of the corruption."
734,"The Road to Darnassus : The road to Darnassus must be kept safe. Corrupted furbolgs from the Gnarlpine tribe have been attacking travelers relentlessly.Important news and commerce travels to and from Darnassus by way of this road daily. We cannot afford to have a rogue band of heathens terrorizing people.Take up arms in the name of the sacred forest, <class>. Their den lies up this northern path. Slay these Gnarlpine ambushers and report back to me."
735,"More Bits, More Bits! : We need more Aqir samples, $p. As many as you can get your hands on!  I've made some fascinating discoveries already, but there's so much more to learn.  With further study and a bit of good luck, perhaps we can slowly begin to uncover some of their weaknesses."
736,"The Corruption of the Jadefire : The cleansing of this forest has been a grueling process. For every success we have achieved, a new challenge has arisen.The Jadefire satyr have been a constant nuisance. They seek to corrupt the forest just as we seek to cleanse it. Now, we have taken steps to begin eradicating them from Felwood entirely.Travel to Jadefire Glen to the west and rid the forest of their presence. You'll find the entrance just north of the walls of Deadwood Village; look for their vile banners."
737,"Dream of a Better Tomorrow : Mr. D is sick, <mister/miss>. Won't you help him? All you have to do is find his hat and batteries and he'll be all better. I'd go get them myself, but I can't leave Mr. D alone!His hat was stolen by the meanies in the Venture Co. over at the water wheel and his batteries are hidden around Windshear Crag. You'll just have to look real hard for those!Would you kindly bring Mr. D's stuff back so he can teach those baddies in the Alliance a lesson?"
738,"Blacken the Skies : <name>! Give us a hand here, will ya? Gorsch here had a bad experience at the all-you-can-eat seafood joint back in town, and now we're short a pilot.My job was to take out those elven glaive throwers before they cut our air units to ribbons. Hop on this wind rider and take to the skies! One of my bombardier buddies will ride with you and bomb the targets at your command.And hey! Chuck a bomb straight at the night elven command center - the large building south of here, beside the bridge. Glorious!"
739,"Rite of Wisdom : To gain acceptance amongst the elders of Thunder Bluff you must next complete the Rite of Wisdom.Now that you have passed the Rite of Vision, the ancestral spirits of Red Rocks will give you the blessing of our ancestors. Only those who have drunk from the Water of Seers can gain the blessing.Travel east of Thunder Bluff, to Red Rocks and seek out the Ancestral Spirit, <name>."
740,"Report to the Denmother : With the goblins scattered and their equipment destroyed, they'll either get the message and leave, or be easy pickings if they choose to stay. We've won here.You've fought as fiercely as any member of the pack, <name>. Return to the Denmother and let her know of our success. I'll be maintaining my watch."
741,"The Forgotten Pools : Have you felt the tremors, <class>? Something has cleaved this land in two. But we druids can sense other tremors, as well.Life is stirring in lands once dry and lifeless. The oases around the Crossroads are suddenly blooming. I can sense a power leaking its way to the surface, but from where? Is it related to the disaster that shattered the Barrens?We must find the source. Travel to the Forgotten Pools, northwest of the Crossroads. Search its waters for a source of power, then return here."
742,"Rain of Destruction : Just in time, <class>. The elves have launched another attack!From the guard towers, use the accursed ore to mark targets for Draaka.Her projectiles will strike your target and erupt in fel magic flame, destroying any nearby enemies.There is strong prejudice against the use of demonic magics. Unjustified, but real nonetheless. For this reason, I will transform you into an imp for the duration of the mission to prevent you from being identified."
743,"Wet Work : Listen carefully, <class>.There are three leaders in this region who are commanding the elves, keeping their focus directed on the lumber camp. Slaying them will certainly cause panic and disarray, hopefully enough for us to successfully complete our mission.While you're at it, bringing down their scouts can only aid our cause."
744,"Fortune and Glory : We have to keep moving, <name>. It's just a matter of time before those troops get their act together.The coffer should be just beyond these ruins.Stay on your toes. Something tells me this isn't over yet..."
745,"Firestarter : You are now able to understand the script in which the journal was written.Along the runestone, it is explained that the monument's gemstones were imbued with the power to summon a firestorm.The storm could grow to be a mighty weapon either through sustained worship of Elune, or charged by spiritual energies of the fallen.Looking down upon the newly revealed ghosts of Elune's disciples, you reason that you have neither the time, nor the inclination to worship the goddess of your enemy...."
746,"Gather the Intelligence : It's me, <name>, Ortell!Don't look directly at the outhouse... you'll give away my position.Everything's going according to plan then?  Excellent!I'm going to need you to obtain some intelligence while you're here.  It might not seem like much to get our hands on a map or a letter, but it may mean saving a hundred lives on our side if we can anticipate our enemy's next move."
747,"War on the Twilight's Hammer : Make no mistake about this, <name>.  The outcome of this war will determine the very survival of our world as we know it.The Twilight's Hammer has become more powerful than ever with Deathwing's return.  Should they succeed in taking over the World Tree, they might strike a blow from which we will never recover.It is time we beat back the enemy.  It is time we crushed the Twilight's Hammer."
748,Return to the Shrine : Aviana's Egg should have arrived safely back at the Shrine. You should go check on it! Choluna should know how to handle this.I'll finish the last of our business here and catch up with you later.
749,Tortolla's Triumph : I'll escort the children of Tortolla out of here and seal up this accursed portal.I'll leave it to you to inform Tortolla of our victory. Simply step back through the flamegate. The ancient will be pleased!
750,"Where Are the Parts? : I've been waiting on parts for these guns for days! I sent one of my best blastgineers and two dozen miners into the Deep Reaches five days ago for the parts. After not hearing from anybody for three days I began to get a little worried. The Overlord sent two of his best orcs in to see what was going on. We've received no reports since then...Head into the Deep Reaches, directly below this fortress, and find out what's going on! I need parts!"
751,"Spare Parts Up In Here! : Whew, that was tough. I didn't think we'd make it, <name>. We better get these parts back to Chief Blastgineer Bombgutz. I think I hear the gnome flying machines buzzing outside. We haven't got a minute to lose!"
752,"Rejoining the Forest : It is time to say goodbye now. You have raised me from a seedling, brief though it was, but now I must rejoin the forest.Take me back to the hill you found me on. There I will set my roots, and grow in the shadow of the ancients that came before me."
753,"Beginning of the End : Champion, we have acquired a new target. Our scouts in Battlescar Valley report that the night elves are preparing their own weapon of mass destruction and hiding it within an ancient tree. They will never be given the chance to use their weapon against us.You are to escort the bomb to the Sludgewerks for refueling and then to Cliffwalker Post, from which we will detonate the bomb and kill all of our enemies.Go now, <name>. Report to Jibbly Rakit when you arrive at the Sludgewerks."
754,"The First Step : What you see here is the work of the quilboar, young one. Year after year they have encroached on our village. The great cataclysm finally drove them from their dens to spread like locusts across the land, and now you see the result; my own mother, dead from their savagery.Today, you are of age. Today, you will take up your weapon and fight for the tribe, and avenge the Greatmother. Follow the path to the east, and find my son, Grull. He will lead you in our strike against the quilboar."
755,"War Dance : Some see our people as gentle giants, or noble savages. They have never seen us fight against our own kind...against betrayers from within.The Grimtotem were offered mercy in exile, and they have scarred their own home to spite us. They will no longer be tolerated in Mulgore.I've already sent our warriors ahead to drive them out through Stonetalon Pass, to the north. You have fought bravely against the Grimtotem, <name>; I ask that you join the battle again. Go, and help deal this final blow."
756,"Winterwater : I don't want our gambit to fail, <name>. Such a failure would only draw attention to our efforts, giving Umbranse an opportunity to hone his defenses. No, we have to do this right the first time.The Frostwhisper Gorge, to the south, provides us access to powerful ice elementals. The water within these elementals' hulls should amplify the power of your dreamcatcher, ensuring our efforts.Obtain this water, <name>. Then return to our small camp."
757,"To Track a Thief : Animal tracks surround the wreckage, tracks made by enormous curved claws. They appear to be raptor tracks.Your first instinct is that raptor-riders assaulted the caravan, but the impressions aren't deep and there are no non-animal tracks to be seen.The tracks head northeast of here toward the east side of Thorn Hill. The answer to this mystery must lie in its shadow."
758,"He Needs Ale! : <Marley grasps the side of your head with a shaking, bloody hand.>Ale... Must... have ale...Ol' Barkerstout from inside. <He coughs.> That should ... do the trick."
759,"The Prophet's Dying Words : We... are... bound by oath... to protect the scepter of Orsis.Listen, <class>, I don't have much time... left.Find the sacred receptacle... in the southern end of the city.Do not... let it... fall into their... hands..."
760,"End of the Supply Line : Cho'gall's Twilight Proveditors swear a blood oath that they will get their supplies through to the front, pledging a pound of their own considerable flesh for every pound of supplies they fail to deliver. They would rather die than fail.See to it that they do both."
761,"Mental Training: Speaking the Truth to Power : You might think you're ready to receive the knowledge we're to impart on you.  But you are not.Think of your mind as a box inside a series of other boxes.Each step of our training will open one of those boxes, until you are ready to achieve direct communion with the elements.Take the Core of Ascension and answer all questions it asks of you, truthfully.  Failing to do so could be... fatal."
762,"The Push Westward : Our work is done here, <name>.  Against all odds, we stopped the Neferset advance on Nahom.Let us join the forces pushing west, lest they take all the glory for themselves.They must've reached the outskirts of Neferset City by now."
763,"Close to Tears : Our warriors have observed foul manifestations coming forth from numerous void tears within the surrounding jungle.   They have been but mere weaklings, clearly intended to test our defenses before the real forces arrive.  If we do not deal with this threat now, however, it will only be a matter of time until we are overrun by their fodder.  Find a way to close those portals!"
764,"The Kurken is Lurkin' : After the crystal storm had subsided, a beast of myth appeared in our village. Brought here by the invading wildkin, this beast, the Kurken, laid waste to our village. Many Stillpine were slain in defense of our lands by this fiend and many have since lost their lives attempting to subdue the beast.In my visions, I have seen one defeat the Kurken. The one must be you, <name>. You are our only hope. Enter Stillpine Hold and slay the Kurken. Bring me his hide as proof of deed."
765,"A Favorite Treat : I've made a wonderful discovery, <class>. On the uncorrupted part of the island grows a remarkable fruit called the sand pear. They're found near the bottoms of the trees.I've been preparing pies from them, but if I'm not careful, the elekk will start to wander over and steal my fruit. I've taken to gathering enough to share with the animals, but my stores are gone and the craving for pie has returned. Would you be willing to help gather the fruit I need for another batch of pies? I promise I'll share!"
766,"Grundig Darkcloud, Chieftain of the Grimtotem : The Grimtotem chieftain awaits your arrival, <name>. Take the weapon crates with you and head to Grimtotem Post, south of here.Good luck, <name>. Should anything happen to you I will personally notify your next of kin and let King Wrynn know what you have done for the Alliance."
767,"Falling to Corruption : The aggression of the Winterfall furbolg has to have its source somewhere. I'd like to get to the bottom of it if I can!I've seen the furbolg in the camps to the north brewing something in a cauldron. They seemed very protective of it... if whatever they're cooking up is what's causing this, I must examine it myself.Find that cauldron if it's still there, and bring me back what's inside!"
768,"Is Your Oil Running? : Last time we had an oil leak this bad, the oil itself tried to get away!I don't know what does it, maybe all the demon goop floating around here, but when we get a big enough crude leak half of it globs together and tries to run away.That's profit trying to escape! Go run after those oil sludges and bring back their sweet, precious oil!"
769,Crisis at Splintertree : There will be no help coming from Splintertree.The elves have launched a major assault on our stronghold there and they have the place surrounded!We must inform Kadrak or die trying!Your kodo has been loaded up with the wood you collected. Let me know when you're ready and we'll charge the enemy lines.
770,"Making Stumps : As you've been told by now, we are to escort a diplomat from within the besieged lumber camp to safety.As it stands, that's simply impossible. The elves have a thousand arrows trained on the camp's exits.First we must create a diversion - something that will take their eyes off of the camp for a time.My idea is simple. Take this axe and cut down the trees they've been nurturing in the region.When you're through, light the brazier here to speak with me again."
771,"On to Something : This is remarkable work you've done! Especially for someone who hasn't taken my courses.These tablets provide new information on several subjects.They indicate that these obelisks are part of an enormous ancient mechanism that once kept this whole region masked from the rest of the world.They also depict how to recharge the mechanism, which is where your Shaft of the Stars comes in...Get ready, <name>. We have some history to make!"
772,"Help Mudsprocket : The Steamwheedle Cartel's new outpost in the southern part of the marsh isn't faring so well. The zeppelin carrying supplies to Mudsprocket crashed, leaving them without vital tools, food, and medical supplies.Follow the road down south and into the marsh's interior. You'll pass by Tabetha's Farm and the Stonemaul Ruins before the road brings you to Mudsprocket. Offer any help you can provide to the town's leadership."
773,"The Glowing Fruit : Hanging from beneath the fronds of this glowing plant is a large, round fruit.Denalan would want to study this fruit, you are certain."
774,"To Be Horde... : Stand by me, <name>, and watch as our mighty weapon destroys our enemies!Learn what it means to be Horde!"
775,"Scavenged : <You discover a cargo manifest on the body, detailing a long list of sundries urgently needed on the front.><A bloody trail in the dirt indicates bodies were dragged south of here, toward the raptor dens.><The raptors may have dragged away the supplies, as well. Retrieving those supplies for Corporal Teegan could help salvage this disaster!>"
776,"Sunken Treasure : The treasure has been on the sea floor so long that the gems have calcified into thick stone. But the power harnessed in these goggles will allow you to locate them easily.A little gnomish ingenuity goes a long way!So borrow the Goggles of Gem Hunting, <name>, and see if you can collect some of the lost treasure for Captain O'Breen.I'd swim down there myself but...um...well, I have important scientific business to tend to up on the safe, dry land....er, yeah."
777,"Inoculation : Zhanaa needs our help to salvage parts from the Exodar.  Taerix prepared an inoculum that can be given to the Nestlewood owlkin that live in the area of a lot of the salvage.Just get close to the unaffected ones and use the crystal on them.  Unfortunately, you'll have to kill the others.  You'll find the owlkin at Nestlewood Thicket and Nestlewood Hills to the southeast."
778,"The Stagnant Oasis : Can what's happening to the south happen here? Judging by what you found at the Forgotten Pools, these oases may be the key. Let's perform an experiment.Here, take these seeds I've collected from the summit here. They are dead and infertile, but carry them down to the Stagnant Oasis just below us. If there is a fissure there, then place the seeds within it... and observe. Report your findings back to Tonga at the Crossroads."
779,"They Took Our Gnomes : The gnome explosives squad we requested from Tinker Town arrived last week. Just in time to face an assault by the Horde. We lost a lot of soldiers that day. Most of the gnome team was taken as well. Now we're neck deep in Horde, Silverwind Refuge has been lost and we're down a dozen gnomes.I'm begging for your help here, <name>. Travel east to Silverwind Refuge and look for any gnome survivors. They were all carted off by a big, merciless orc named Thundrak. Find him and you'll find our gnomes."
780,"Theramore Spies : The Horde and Alliance hold an uneasy truce.  Outlying skirmishes and covert actions are taken by one side against the other, and it is our duty to ensure the Horde is on top!Now is the chance to do just that.Alliance infiltrators have taken positions east of Brackenwall Village.  They spy on the village and report our movements to Theramore, which we cannot allow.Hunt down the infiltrators and slay them.  Send a clear message to their superiors that we will not tolerate their spies' presence!"
781,"Twilight of the Dawn Runner : The ogres here are useful for little more than crude jokes, sour ale, and bouts of headbutting. When my ship, the Dawn Runner, ran aground, those curs from Theramore made off with my cargo and last surviving crewman. I made my way here searching for help, but those good-for-nothing ogres stared blankly at me when I told them my story.I could use the help of a reliable <race> in recovering what remains of my cargo and freeing Ithania from North Point Tower, to the northeast, where they're being held."
782,"Message for Saurfang : <The Darkspear loyalist opens the package and reads the letter within. As she finishes the note from Thrall, a hint of a fanged smile appears on her face.>Ya should take dis directly to Saurfang inside Orgrimmar. Be sure ta let him know dat de package be from Thrall.Take me raptor. Hurry, little one, dere be no time ta waste!"
783,"Teldrassil: The Coming Dawn : There is one last moonwell that I would like you to visit.  It is directly south of here, on the shores of the Pools of Arlithrien. Be wary as you seek out the well, and keep your weapons close at hand. I sense a growing corruption from the boughs of southern Teldrassil.When you have the water, I want you to bring it to a familiar face that you'll see at the pools. She wishes to battle the corruption, and has asked for you personally."
784,"The Captured Scout : I've heard about you, <name>, and the news you brought from the south.  The battle has reached a stalemate.One that I fear is about to be broken by the Firelord's reawakening.That is unless we tip the scales in our favor in some way.There is a scout that was captured by the Twilight's Hammer.  I believe she was in possession of valuable intelligence. Find her in the Twilight camp to the west."
785,"No Accounting for Taste : <The machine buzzes for a few moments  before Wizbang's voice breaks through.>Interesting! The source of this corruption definitely came from something external--no surprises there--but it appears that in this case they've been eating something foul. A large mammal probably. Most likely a bear.Search the beach for a bear carcass for me. Slightly east of there would make the most sense, on the inland side of the beach. Bring me the sample back at town."
786,"Arms of the Grimtotems : If the equipment you found at the ruins of the inn belonged to a Grimtotem attack party, there's likely to be more just like it within their camp to the northwest.We haven't been able to gather much information about Blackhoof Village, but judging from the size of the raiding parties, there's a substantial force based there.Do whatever you have to to capture some of their equipment so that we can compare it with your findings from the inn."
787,"The Darkmist Legacy : I am chained to this place...it takes so much effort just to speak to you. I can barely maintain this shape.I could help you, but please, help me pull myself together first. Once I'm more focused on this plane, I should be able to do it...If I could just leave this tomb, the soil itself outside is full of ancient arcane deposits, laying forgotten for centuries. Could you bring me some?"
788,"Intercepting the Message : It is good to see you again, <name>. I have a quandary that you might be able to solve.Our agents situated behind Sunhawk lines have reported seeing Sunhawk soldiers parsing an unusual document.Unfortunately, we have been unsuccessful in acquiring a copy of the document for ourselves. I need you to go out in the field and try to recover the document. I am certain that if you apply enough pressure, a Sunhawk agent will turn over the information we seek. I leave the use of force to your discretion."
789,"Holdout at Hunter's Hill : Honor's Stand may have been lost, but its spirit was never crushed. Even now survivors are holding out at a point called ""Hunter's Hill.""Continue following the high road and you will find our camp just up ahead. Speak with Onatay when you get there and let her know the trail is, for the moment, still clear."
790,"Your Place In The World : Finally, you are of age, <name>... of age to battle in the name of the Horde. To conquer for the glory of the Warchief.  Yes...  <Kaltunk looks you over.>  You will do nicely.  No doubt you wish to find a great dragon or demon and strangle it with your bare hands, but perhaps it would be wise to start on something less... dangerous.  <Kaltunk laughs.>  Report to Gornek, he should be able to assign a task better suited to a young <class>. You will find him seated at the fire behind me."
791,"Management Material : Truun needs wood, huh? Normally I could provide, but not today.With constant elf attacks, gathering lumber is dangerous work. The peons I have left are reluctant to venture into the woods.You want wood? Then you go convince the peons to work.And keep them safe! I cannot afford to lose any more!"
792,"From Bad to Worse : After their ship crashed, evil creatures swept up from the sea to pick through the wreckage. Our aid may seem but a drop in the pond at the thought of the misfortune they've faced today.Defeat their tormentors. These people desperately need our help."
793,Together Again : We saw to it that the brave was healed and re-equipped. I already sent him back into the field.Head back up and go to Darkcloud Pinnacle. He'll meet you there.
794,"Club Foote : All this new friction between the Alliance and the Horde was leading to windfall profits, until Rear Admiral Hartley sailed into MY harbor and started poking his prow into my business. He's been searching and seizing vessels flying horde colors with the goal of depriving them use of a neutral port.I'm not about to allow some fat-fingered human to cut into my profits! Get me the schematics of his flagship. Hartley's Chief Engineer is soaking himself at the Broken Keel Tavern just up the hill..."
795,"The Call of Kalimdor : Say, you haven't seen a fish about this long?  Short fins?  Responds to the name Steve?  He's blue?Never mind, I'll keep looking.Actually... there was another reason I came here to Booty Bay.  Boss Krog, over in Dustwallow, is looking for new blood.  Someone to help us Stonemaul from getting overrun.  You look strong enough.Wait on the edge of the pier for the next ship, then ride to Ratchet.  Gazlowe should be able to help you from there.Steve?  Steve!"
796,"Propaganda War : The deserter agents were doing far more than just chatting up the guards. We've found a number of leaflets the deserters somehow managed to smuggle in on a ship in the docks.The ship used to transport the leaflets is still in Theramore, at the farthest dock. If you can sneak aboard and capture the rest of their propaganda documents, their agents will lose their most powerful tool. Be careful! The ship is manned by seasoned privateers and the cargo is probably being kept in the captain's quarters."
797,"Fish in a Bucket : I'll reward anyone who makes my life a bit easier... I enjoy doing as little as possible, mon!Below the docks here in Shadowprey Village, I've many shellfish traps.  If you're kind enough to do my work and collect me my shellfish, then I'll reward you with something you want... get my drift mon?"
798,"Disturbing Connections : The letter from Garrosh Hellscream makes clear the suspicions that were raised during the offensive on the Shatterspear. The presence of forsaken at the tower ruins and horde supplies and enforcers at the Shatterspear War Camp were only the start. Garrosh himself contacted the Shatterspear to spur their offensive towards Lor'danel, and it seems clear that he fully intends to push from the south as well.Glynda Nal'Shea will need this information if the night elves are to be prepared."
799,"Disassembly : We have to stop these juggernauts before they're completely encased in armor. Right now they're vulnerable, but only if we pry aside the plates and hack at the marred flesh beneath.Take my shiv, and jam it between the plates of armored juggernauts to deprive them of their armor.Once they break from their trance, you're in for a tough fight - keep prying loose that armor and stop those juggernauts!"
800,"See the Invisible : Yeah, yeah, your stuck-up mage friend there hit it on the nose. The imps over at Shadowlurk Ridge are hiding the key to the satyr's barrier in the nether. It's right there, but you can't see it or touch it unless you're shifted.I guess you're out of luck though, because only imps can phase shift! So you should just close your eyes, turn around, and let me go...It was just a joke! Don't hurt me! I'll need slime from the cursed oozes around these ruins. Bring me enough to cover you from head to toe!"
801,The Third Flamegate : Memorize the glyph.Take it within yourself.Draw it on the ground before the flamegate.East of here.Enter the Firelands.I cannot come with you.But my children await. Inside.Find Garunda Mountainpeak within the realm of flame.
802,"Seeking Soil : <The tiny sproutling shuffles around, motioning you towards the south. You can barely hear a faint voice.>Soil...<It looks like it wants fresh soil. Maybe you should guide it to some of the richer-looking patches.>"
803,"Scalding Signs : The cauldron looked like it contained concentrated material. If the Winterfall are diluting this stuff directly in the springs, contamination could build up over time... and then the dilution would be less and less effective.The spring to the northeast has boiled over with elementals. I thought it was because of the cataclysm, but their appearance could be a reaction to this.Could you check them for corruption? Hunt a few and bring me any bits of green foreign material they leave behind."
804,"Rite of Vision : Again, be sure you are ready to leave Bloodhoof Village behind, <name>. The next step on your journey will take you far from here.Your path continues to lead onward, across the fields of Mulgore, the eyes of the Earth Mother on you at all times. When you are ready, consume the waters near the tribal fire. Once you have ingested the holy waters, your eyes will be opened, and the spirits will guide you."
805,Seril's Boast : Brutes and amateurs.It doesn't matter how sharp or heavy your weapon is if all it's good for is hacking like an ogre. I could go on and on about finesse and speed and balance and control... but it's easier to one-up these fools.Tell Deez we've got one more order for him. I need a block of ice.
806,"Trailing the Spiritspeaker : I have heard tales of Umbranse, though I have not ever met him in person. Rumor has it that he's been collecting magical artifacts, though for what purpose, I couldn't say.Best pass this information on to a trusted ally. Nymn, the high elf, can be found within Everlook, the large goblin town to the northeast. Tell him all that we learned today."
807,"Where's Synge? : Hey, <name>, you haven't seen our gunsmith, Synge, have you?I just know that the pirates captured him! He said that he was going to try to sell them some rifles, or something.Would you please look for him up at the Southsea Holdfast to the east? I'll bet that no-good gnome he's always traveling with, Wizzle Brassbolts, got him into trouble!"
808,"Mudrock Soup and Bugs : I'm working on a dish I call ""Mudrock Soup and Bugs.""  I still need the major ingredients, and... well, I don't think I'd last long trudging through Dustwallow Marsh!So, <name>, can you do some hunting for me?  First, I need the tongues of Mudrock turtles.  You can find Mudrocks along the coast, mostly around the bay.But I don't want just any tongues!  I hear that the tongues of some Mudrocks are forked...They say the forked tongues have a distinct flavor, and I want that flavor in my dish..."
809,"Mor'shan Caravan Pick-Up : The battle in Ashenvale rages on without relent. Our forces at the Mor'shan Ramparts are in desperate need of reinforcements and supplies.We have a major shipment of medicines and food headed north, and I need a capable <class> like you to guard it.Rocco Whipshank waits for you at the road north out of the Crossroads. Let him know you are ready to accompany the caravan."
810,"Friend of a Friend : I need to unpack and look around the area a bit. In the meantime, I have an old friend I'd like you to meet.Sullah and I go way back. He's a man who can be trusted, and that's pretty rare these days.Why don't you go on over and introduce yourself."
811,"A Time to Reap : No one knows better than the Cenarion Circle that this lush oasis could dry up as quickly as it appeared.We must take care not to interfere with the processes taking place here, but to support and preserve them,A new species of plant, very plentiful in the surrounding region, has appeared since the great change.Collect samples of these for me, that I might study them and learn what they have to teach us,"
812,"Delivery Device : As fate would have it, there's a special deed that needs doing - one that will benefit the Cenarion Circle as well as myself.You see, <class>, I am under pressure to create a special... concoction, shall we say. I believe my work to be complete, but I need to have it tested to be certain.The target of this test is to be the naga, who threaten this region from the west. Their demise would surely aid the Circle.First though, I need a delivery device. Hollow horns from the dying kodo should do nicely."
813,"Forces of Nature: Mountain Giants : The mountain giants are our most powerful allies of the forest. They're carved from the land itself.Not many of our enemies are willing to fight off a walking hillside. It only takes a few of these to turn the tide of a battle completely.The mountain giants here have been afflicted by some illness lately, but I've seen a healthy group of them to the southwest."
814,Elune's Fire : We need special flame for ritual.  We need Elune's fire.Horoo's spirit wanders east of here.  Horoo carries torch of Elune.  Bring here so spirits rest.Aroom thanks you.
815,"A Plea From Beyond : <You can't make sense of the spirit's urgent plea, but maybe Choluna can decipher what's going on here.><Speak with Choluna back inside the shrine!>"
816,"Dangers of the Windfury : Thank you for taking the time to speak to me, <name>. I am Ruul, warrior and teacher.You have obviously reached an age when you must prepare for your trials if you are to adventure much further out of Mulgore.If you wish a test of your strength, start by seeking out the Windfury harpies to the southeast. They nestle along the mountain's edges away from the road.They are one of our natural enemies here in Mulgore and will be a good gauge of your skill."
817,Warchief's Command: Azshara! : All able-bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Ag'tor Bloodfist at the Orgrimmar Rear Gate in Azshara.Aid in driving back the encroaching Alliance forces and assist in securing Azshara for the glory of the Horde!Depart Orgrimmar through its northern gate to reach the Orgrimmar Rear Gate in Azshara.Destiny calls!
818,"Ancient Weapons : Though we aren't formally at war yet, the Neferset do not hesitate to imprison or kill all who trespass upon their territories.King Phaoris refuses to reciprocate, even when they use our lands to smuggle stolen relics from the tombs of our ancestors.My scouts report that the Neferset are about to move a major shipment of looted weapons south of here.I've instructed the laborers you recruited to assist you.  Call upon them with this horn when you find the smugglers and recover the weapons."
819,"Jarl Needs a Blade : I have cutting to do.  I can't tell you what I'm going to cut, but... I need myself a blade.  A certain blade...Some people call it a sword.  I call it a swing blade.You help me?  Those fish-men, you know, murlocs or whatever they're called.... There's one they call Razorspine, carries a big sword, lives north of here near the beach. That's the sword I need!But don't sleep on this.  What I'm cutting won't keep forever..."
820,"Agents of Destruction : The Warsong Lumber Camp is a blight upon an embattled landscape. Every time we make progress in halting their operations, Overseer Gorthak orders his loggers to redouble their efforts!Now, the orcs are cutting more wood than they can possibly use, leaving it to rot while their blades bite into fresh trees! This is an affront to all we stand for, <name>, and we will show them that we'll not suffer further destruction of our lands!Go, and do not rest until Overseer Gorthak and his minions are dead!"
821,"Oh, It's Real : Yes, Tethyr is certainly real, and he lives in the waters off Theramore.Has a thing for bright lights. He's the reason they shut down the lighthouse in the first place, you know...And if you light it up again, he'll come right back. But no one in their right mind would do that.So that must be your plan! It's been good sharing a drink with you, but don't blame ol' Nat if Tethyr REALLY turns you into fish bait. If you're going to do this, make sure you consult Major Mills at the Theramore docks."
822,"Going Deep : I have fashioned a charm that will allow you to infiltrate the naga, giving you the appearance of one of their own.With this disguise, you will be able to speak and understand their language. They will be unable to discern your true identity.But beware! The sharks and other sea creatures here will expose you for all to see. Avoid them at all costs.Now go. Speak to the Priestess of Azshara and do what you must to learn of their purposes here."
823,"Might of the Firelord : I've been charged with leading our military operations against the enemy.  A humbling task when you consider there are demigods walking among us.I'm going to have you carry out a series of hit-and-run attacks behind enemy lines.  It will be important that you keep the enemy off guard and weaken their numbers ahead of our main force's attack.Your first target will be the Ascendant's Rise, where the most highly trained Twilight's Hammer devotees have achieved a partial elemental state."
824,"Coming of Age : You have survived the wilds of our new home and shown yourself a cut above the others. I believe that you have come of age to assist those battling on the front lines of Bloodmyst. The Hand of Argus could use a <race> like you. Report to Torallius the Pack Handler. You will find him outside the Exodar, tending to the elekk. Give him these orders so that he may direct you towards your new duties on Bloodmyst."
825,"Segmentation Fault: Core Dumped : Once we flush the central reactor, I need you to return the core to me. It's 100% refined azsharite crystal, which is both powerful and dangerous. And lovely. Oh precious azsharite, the shaper of worlds to come!The giant lever to your left will dump the core and send it to me via the rail system. The core will be superheated, so you'll need to periodically douse it with the Fireliminator on the way here... don't let it reach critical temperature!"
826,"Match the Hatch : Don't fret, I'm sure no ill will become of hatching this creature. After all, the aqir can't be born evil, can they?  Of course, we have no idea how to take care of such an egg. I will need you to do some investigating.  Head back to the aqir hives and see if you can find any other, similar eggs. If we can observe how they're being treated, we might be able to apply those learnings here."
827,"Alliance Attack Plans : <You pry the note loose from Fuzzwhistle's hand.>They're onto us! They know all about the bomb. Planning an attack on Krom'gar Fortress! I think they sent a search party after me. Won't go out like a chump. They'll get a fight.I think I hear them coming now! Their leader is a high elf huntress named Davinia. She spoke of attack plans. Avenge me by killing her and getting those plans! Her tent is nearby, to the east.Hellscream's eyes are upon you..."
828,"The Balance of Nature : Greetings, <name>. I am Ilthalaine. My purpose in Shadowglen is to train young <class>s like you and to ensure that the balance of nature is maintained.The spring rains were particularly heavy this year, causing some of the forest's beasts to flourish while others suffered. Unfortunately, the nightsaber numbers grew too large, and they will devastate the other populations if they are not culled.Journey forth, young <class>, and thin saber populations so that nature's harmony will be preserved."
829,"Signs of Things to Come : I will pursue the trail of the Gnarlpine and track this corruption to its source. If you ever encounter Athridas Bearmantle in Dolanaar, he knows intimately of the problems that plague this forest, and he can direct you on how to help further.I'm sure we will meet again with time. Perhaps you can aid me in dealing with the source of this corruption once I locate it. For now, I will take you back to Dentaria so that you may finish your training. Thank you for all that you have done, <name>."
830,"Warriors' Redemption : Those that surrendered when Honor's Stand fell are no longer worthy of our Horde, <class>. But I'm not giving up on them yet. The prison tower below us is lightly guarded. Let's give those prisoners one final chance to die with honor.I've set up ropes that will allow you to quickly clamber up and down the mountain. Slip down, acquire the confiscated weapons, and re-arm the prisoners inside the tower.And <name>, stay by the tower! We're not yet equipped for an assault on the base proper."
831,"Profitability Scouting : Things seem to be quieting down a bit. Gallywix will probably keep forking out cash to keep us posted here, but I have a feeling we might be able to milk a bit more out of the deal.Naga and Sea Giants aren't normally friends, so the naga must be controlling them somehow. Take this stealth field generator, get in those ruins, and let me know if you find something that looks really pricey."
832,"Maul 'Em With Kindness : Okay, babe, listen up. There's two ways to get people to do what you want. You can provide goods, services, and things people want...or you can beat the living daylights out of them.I've often found it's useful to do both at the same time, and you're pretty familiar with both methods by now. Take these little silithid treats, go and beat some ogres dizzy, and then give them the treat before you knock them completely dead, 'kay?"
833,"The Twilight Lexicon : The Twilight's Hammer are not kind to those that leave their ranks.  They hunt me to this day like I'm some sort of beast!  Needless to say, an enemy of theirs is a friend of mine!To decipher this Tablet I'll need the book used by their scribes to encode secret messages: the Twilight Lexicon.  It's such an important tool that they keep its three chapters in different locations!  The officers entrusted with the Lexicon are known as Twilight Keepers.  Look for them at the Twilight's Hammer camps."
834,"Captain Dreadbeard : This is getting pretty fun, but let's not forget we're here for Gnomeregan!We spotted the captain of the Southsea over on one of his boats to the south, past where all the fighting is. He's all alone on his little boat, undefended!If you go take care of him, we'll have the rest of these pirates mopped up in no time."
835,"Arnak Fireblade : The Searing Collars you brought me are powerful demonic implements.  Divining their origin is, I'm afraid, beyond my skills as a shaman.  We will need a warlock to study them.Take a searing collar to Arnak Fireblade.  Although he is a skilled warlock, he professes to use his powers to thwart demons, and claims his research in the occult is benign.  Be that true or false, we may need his aid against the demonic cult in Durotar.You may find Arnak in Orgrimmar in the Cleft of Shadow."
836,"In the Hands of the Perverse : My former clan, the Felmusk of Night Run, raided Fallen Sky Lake some time ago, stealing the moonstones that were unique to the area.Those moonstones are known to have great healing properties and surely can be used to cure the little girl that lies sick in Astranaar.Night Run rests up the road to the east that runs north. There are multiple paths that lead up into the hills on its eastern side, and it is there that you will find my unrepentant brethren. They will have what you seek."
837,"Claws of White : Stop, <race>.  I could use the help of a <class> like you.Right outside this camp, there are raptors with deadly claws.  I've been using the claws for druid rituals, but it doesn't seem to be working.  However, I did notice that some of those raptors sometimes have white claws, when most have deathly black ones.The earth works in strange ways.  Maybe you could fetch me some of the white claws, and I'll try one last time?"
838,
839,"Ghost-o-plasm Round Up : There's a valley to the southeast, the Valley of Bones, haunted by Magram ghosts.  Sounds scary, doesn't it?  Well think how scary it is to the Magram!  If we captured ghost energy from that place, I bet it'd be worth plenty to those centaurs.Here, take this crate of ghost magnets.  If you place one between the two big skeletons in the valley, the Dead Goliaths, then ghosts will wander to it.  Distance yourself, take out the ghosts and get their ghost-o-plasm--that's what we'll sell to the Magram."
840,"Your New Identity : There.  Not my best work, but certainly not my worst.  You will be known as ""<name>damus"" among the cultists.These papers will bump you ahead of the other recruits and allow you to speak directly to the Twilight instructors.Go to the proving grounds and show these to Condenna the Pitiless.  She's separating the wheat from the chaff.Show her what you're made of."
841,"Nothing a Couple of Melons Won't Fix : The markings on the Sargeron ruins, combined with what you've gleaned from Furien's text make one thing clear:There is something special about the old fountain in the Sanctuary of Elune.It would seem that one could expect special power from washing their face in the fountain. First, of course, there would need to be something in the ancient fountain with which to wash.Pondering this problem, you spot a melonfruit at the base of a nearby tree...."
842,"Consumed : My first concern right now is for the thistle bear families who call what's left of these woods home. Just to our south, beyond the bear shrine, an entire generation has fallen ill. Gruesomely ill.<name>, I don't know what they're suffering from, but it's consumed them from within. It pains me that a whole generation is beyond saving, but we've got to kill them off so that the earth can reclaim their bodies.More importantly, we need to find the source. Investigate the shallow lake they drink from!"
843,"Save the Children! : The military will not allow me outside the cellar, but my children are still in my farm!  Please, you must go find them.The Forsaken have no regard for innocent life -- my kids are in great danger!Their names are Cynthia, Ashley and James.  If you find them, bring them back here.  I'll be forever in your debt."
844,"The Demon Prince : The Jadefire satyr that have overrun so much of Felwood work directly with the Shadow Council.These satyr answer directly to the ancient and powerful Prince Xavalis. Some say he is the son of Xavius, the first satyr, blessed by Sargeras himself.Whatever his nature, he must die if we are to scatter the Jadefire and reclaim our barrow dens. Journey deep into Shadow Hold and slay him. Show him no mercy; he will have none for you."
845,"Ending Their World : Don't accept this assignment if you value your life. You see that gigantic power core jutting out of the mountain side over yonder? Whoever takes on this burden will need to fight their way through that mountain, battling an army of Sunhawks while protecting me as I rig the core up for demolition. Sironas the eredar is somewhere up there as well.I won't think less of you if you just walk away, <name>.But maybe you're the one - the one to destroy the Vector Coil and take down Sironas. Well, are you?"
846,"Lion's Pride : If you seek vengeance on our Alliance invaders, you would do well to observe the fiercest of predators in the Barrens.The lions that stalk amongst the tall grass do so with cunning, stealth, and power. Learn from their example and you will understand the kind of war we need to fight.Hunt the plains prowlers and pridemanes, then return to me to discuss what you have learned. You will often find them in the shade of large trees."
847,"How to Make Meat Fresh Again : I don't believe we've met... I'm Nolen Tacker, Marshal Expeditions' new chief of the guards.  I'm also their chef.  There's actually more overlap than you'd think.I've got a fun little task for you.  Have you seen the spike pits around the perimeter of the camp?  See if you can convince some of the nearby dinosaurs to walk into them.  If you throw this rotten meat at them when they're not looking, it'll either make them hungry or angry.  Either way is fine, as long as they follow you into the pit!"
848,"To the Hilt! : You immediately recognize this statue from a sketch in Furien's Journal.Though the words associated with the entry elude you, the sketch seems self-explanatory. After battle, the enemies' weapons were to be cast upon the basin in exchange for a divine gift of some sort.As you ponder this ritual, the glint of steel catches your eye from a nearby weapon rack...."
849,"Medicinal Purpose : I have found that lashers milling about on the island hold restorative medicinal properties in their vines. Through proper treatment, the vines can be broken down into a powerful healing ointment. Unfortunately, with so many injured draenei passing through Azure Watch, we are always in short supply.Our delicate guest was found injured and unconscious by the Crystalbrook only yesterday. If you bring me vines, we may be able to save her.You will find root trappers both south and east of Azure Watch."
850,"Do Yourself a Favor : So these night elves send out a desperate call for help to us, goes something like this:<Gnombus changes the pitch of his voice to sound like a woman.>""Please come help us! The big, mean Horde has goblins! Oh, we can't handle goblins! They pull our hair and make us cry!""Right, anyway, so here we are.The first thing I did was upgrade their aerial defenses with some of my new sniper guns. Problem is, they don't use guns. Do yourself a favor and lend 'em a hand, eh? Find 'em south of here."
851,WANTED: Deathclaw : By order of Harbinger Mikolaas: A bounty of 18 silver to be paid to the brave soul who returns with proof of the marauding bear Deathclaw's demise.Deathclaw should be considered extremely dangerous and is responsible for the killing of a survey team on the coast to the northwest of Blood Watch. Travelers are advised to avoid the area.
852,"Barrier to Entry : Filthy, good-for-nothin' night elves have managed to disarm our entire minefield in Talondeep Pass. Somebody is gonna have to go back up there and re-arm them all! A perfect task for a worthless grunt like you, <name>. Here's to hopin' you don't blow yourself up in the process.You'll find our ""Elf Killers"" scattered across Talondeep Pass, directly north of here. Take this wrench and get to work, maggot."
853,"Critters of the Void : Aesom sent my squad out on a reconnaissance mission to search for the sun gate a few days ago. Needless to say, we found it...<Loryi points at Jorli.>Whatever those fool elves are transporting through that portal is causing void energy to be released. The area is teaming with void critters. We must destroy them before they have a chance to grow into void anomalies. You'll find the source of the creatures southwest of here, near the sun gate. Kill them and report back to Aesom when you're done."
854,"Vile Familiars : I trust the Valley of Trials will teach you much, young <class>.  I was sent to the Valley to guide you, but I have discovered a growing taint here...  One of the Burning Blade - a foul, demon-worshipping cult - has made camp here in the Valley of Trials. He skulks in a cave to the north, and his vile familiars have spilled from its mouth to cause havoc.  As your first task against the Burning Blade, I bid you, defeat these familiars. Slay many and, if you survive, return to me."
855,"A Bomb Deal : All my workers got driven straight out of the cavern here by those big swamp-lookin' things! Darla's sent me here to pick up the pieces, but have you seen it in there? I ain't goin' in!There's a ton of explosives left behind that we can't just leave layin' around. I'll make you a deal: You run in there and get those explosives gathered up, and I will stay here and not get killed by swamp-things, and if you don't either, I'll pay ya! How's that sound?"
856,"Into the Clearing : Irontree Clearing must be razed. We can afford no mercy if we want to prevent the goblins from spreading their destruction through the entire forest.Alton Redding, my most trusted protector, has already led much of the pack around the enemy line to strike while they are distracted here. Seek him out to the west, overlooking Irontree Cavern."
857,A Cub's Cravings : Your Winterspring cub looks at you and licks its lips. The little cat must be hungry and it's up to you to find a suitable meal for your charge.Rivern Frostwind mentioned keeping some shardtooth bear meat on hand for feeding his frostsaber cubs. Perhaps your cub would enjoy some fresh shardtooth meat of its own. Various kinds of shardtooth bears can be found all over Winterspring.
858,"Take it up with Tony : This pirate situation is really crimping my operation. Cap'n Garvey is attacking any vessel in sight, even the ones whose owners paid me my bogus ""protection"" money. We need to get these pirates on the take, and fast!I know just the guy, one of Garvey's Lieutenants who's open to wheeling and dealing the Dizzywig way. He's offered to arrange a little 'mutiny' for me. Once we get these guys working for us, it's all gravy, see?Talk to my boy Tony Two-Tusk on Fray Island to the south."
859,"Stinky's Escape : Great, finally something that doesn't want to eat me!!I need help handling the critters around here, and you fit the mold, <buddy/lady>.A goblin from Ratchet named Mebok Mizzyrix needs some bogbean leaves for a potion, or something... I honestly don't care why -- his money was good and I know this swamp, so here I am.Too bad I got myself surrounded before I found the bogbean!  Can you help me out of here, and watch my back as I look for Mebok's plant?"
860,"Return to Camp : What do you think, <name>?  Maybe the High Commander will give me a few men to command.Maybe we can marshal a regiment together.  What do you think?"
861,"A Cure In The Dark : <Some unintelligible speech spews forth from the machine before you make out Wizbang's voice again.>Duskrats! They've been eating the duskrats! Those little buggers only come from one place, a cave against the cliff-face to the east. Find a path up to the northeast and look for an opening under the waterfall.The duskrats there are either getting into something nasty or someone's intentionally spreading some agent through them - in either case, just bring me back several samples of the stuff!"
862,"Uncommon Core : Our scouts have reported that the Amathet are constructing new titanic watchers.   We had long thought this art was lost to the sands of time. It would appear we were mistaken.  I needn't tell you what a boon it would be to have the aid of watcher constructs in our battles for Uldum. We must unlock the secrets of their construction!  The power of a titanic watcher lies in its core. I ask that you bring one to me, so that our artificers might divine its construction."
863,"The Wormwing Problem : Skylord Omnuron has been too gentle with the Wormwing harpies. He allows them to share a perch on this mountain just because they're creatures of the air. Well <class>, not all creatures of the air are created equal.When the attacks on Hyjal began, the Wormwing went into a frenzy. They're up there right now, assaulting a sacred shrine they once claimed to revere.I'm not troubled. Now we have a reason to drive them from Hyjal, don't we?"
864,"Restoring Sanctity : Not long ago, the once tranquil owlkin of the region appeared on the shores of this island. One by one they would come to steal the bones of the fallen dragons. I do not know what would cause these creatures such distress or why they would want the bones of the deceased, but the spirits of the brood have grown restless due to this sacrilege.To the west, across the Crimson Reach, you will find Ragefeather Ridge. Venture to the owlkin encampments and recover the pilfered dragon bones."
865,"The Sun Gate : Thanks to you and the work you did, my scouts were able to find the sun gate. The elves keep the portal location mobile so that they can move it at a moment's notice. That's why the site you investigated was empty.The strength of such a system is also its greatest weakness. The sun gate is stabilized by portal controllers. If we can take down the controllers, the portal will be ours to destroy. The current sun gate location can be found west of here, south of the Vector Coil. Find it and destroy it!"
866,"The Fall of Tichondrius : Yes, Illidan took the power of the Skull of Gul'dan for himself.But did he flee with it into the night? Did he use it for his own glory? No... his very first action was to use his new power to assault the dreadlord Tichondrius!Witness his triumph, <class>. Witness how Illidan reclaimed Felwood from the demons... and the thanks he was given."
867,"Eye for an Eye : This is it, $p. Now is the time to strike.   Take this shredder and destroy their stronghold. Burn everything to the ground!  Show no mercy. They certainly didn't offer any to all of the innocent civilians they slaughtered in Brennadam!"
868,"The Curse of Zin-Malor : You have seen enough. Know that the Crystal of Zin-Malor brings only ruin to all around it.Leave this place, if you do not wish to join us."
869,"Mahka's Plea : I can't put him out of my mind, <name>. Sometimes at night, I can hear his howls of rage and suffering, echoing across the plains. To imagine him out there, alone and in such pain...Please, I must ask a favor of you. Go to Mankrik, and tell him to come see me."
870,"Centaur Bracers : The centaur leadership relies on a core of trusted, disciplined warriors to keep the others in line. If we reduce their numbers, the Kolkar will have no might with which to support their rage. And so, I have a bounty task for you.Around the Lushwater Oasis to the south, slay Kolkar Marauders and Stormseers to collect their bracers. Return when you have a heap of these trophies and the Horde will reward you well."
871,
872,"Fizzled : The flood to the southwest wiped out one of the few Burning Blade camps that still pockmark Durotar.  This one was led by a goblin named Fizzle Darkclaw, and believe me, we're better off without him.Darkclaw, however, did possess an orb that the Horde is interested in procuring.  Who knows why... I leave that to the warlocks.  All I know is that I need that orb."
873,"Ammo Kerblammo : Hartley must've unloaded all of his ordnance along the beach. Let's pull his teeth out, <name>!Run along the shore and look for his munitions stockpiles. Light 'em up and he'll be land-locked and unarmed while the Bellipotent is repaired.I'll meet you back here in Ratchet."
874,"Meeting the Orcs : I haven't lost any love for my homeland or its people, as you know. I've fought tooth and nail for Silvermoon to be allowed a place beside Undercity and Orgrimmar at the negotiating table.This should silence any opposition. Take this letter to Saurfang in Orgrimmar. As leader of the orcs, he must have a say in accepting the sin'dorei's pledge.I've added my own seal to the letter as a personal endorsement. Go northwest of the city and board the zeppelin bound for Durotar at the tower."
875,"Missed Me By Zhat Much! : Okay, <race>! Zhis just got real!Somevone zhinks zhat zhey can get rid of me zhat easily, hmm?Ve shall see about zhat! Nozhink can shtop zhis vork! Nozhink!<Schnottz looks around at the encroaching flames.>Ve should probably get out of here.Huury up! Time is vastink!"
876,"Rellian Greenspyre : <name>, can you take one of the seeds you brought me to my friend, Rellian Greenspyre?  He is a druid that resides at Wellspring Hovel, and when last we spoke he revealed his interest in my work with the Timberlings. He had some ideas himself, and he will appreciate a specimen seed to work with.Thank you, <name>. I hope that, some day, you will see the fruit of my labors.You will find Wellspring Hovel along the road heading west out of Dolanaar, on the way to Darnassus."
877,"An Urgent Meeting : I've been looking for you all over Stormwind, <name>.  The captain has delivered her report to the king. It appears that Stormwind requires your service yet again.  The leaders of the Alliance have gathered together for a meeting at Stormwind Keep, and your presence has been requested by King Wrynn himself. I was instructed to find you and deliver the message without delay.  It has been an honor serving with you, <name>. May the Light bless you on your journey."
878,"Word from Azure Watch : <class>! A couple mutated beasts jumped me and my leg is injured.I was sent on a scouting mission from Azure Watch after we received word from Zhanaa. Please, could you go speak with Caregiver Chellan in my stead? She needs to know how many people to expect in Azure Watch. Just cross the Crystalbrook River here and continue following the road until you get to Azure Watch.Be sure to ask her for a place for yourself to stay in."
879,"The Prophecy of Velen : The Prophet spoke of this day: That on this island, in this new world, our allies would find us.""We will be tested. They will ask that we pay for the sins of our fathers...""At the time, I did not understand the meaning behind his words, but seeing this creature and her reaction to us, it is now coming into focus. The corruption of our people has been felt even here.Venture south. It is there that we found this being. Find its kin and tell them of our people."
880,"Search for Survivors : The bugs came from everywhere... There wasn't any time to react.  Many of my friends died where they stood, while others tried to fight with our meager tools.  I'm a coward. I fled in the commotion instead of trying to help.  Now, here I am, out of food and water and too scared to look for survivors.  Please, I beg you to help anyone you find left alive in Orsis..."
881,"Learning the Language : I think I've cracked it, <name>!<Aurren points to the totem.>All that we need to know about the Stillpine furbolg language is imprinted on their totems. With just a rudimentary understanding of how their symbols work, we can study the totems and learn to communicate with the furbolgs.I've written down the basics of the symbol matrix on this parchment. Study it and then examine the totem. It should lead you to the next language totem.Speak to Arugoo when you return an educated <race>!"
882,"Murlocs... Why Here? Why Now? : These are dark days, Promised One. Even the murlocs are kicking our tails - literally. Unfortunately, more than just my ego has been bruised.While our relationship with the Siltfin murlocs had always been tenuous, never could we have imagined that they would have the gall to attack us and steal from our food stores! Travel west to the Silting Shore and recover our stolen food-stuffs!And if you see a dark-skinned murloc with a patch of white fur stuck in between his webbed toes..."
883,"Deliver Them From Evil... : You must get this information to your people, <name>. While your brave acts have certainly slowed down the plans of Kael'thas and his dark master, the attacks will undoubtedly continue.Take the traitor's communication to your leaders. They must see this for themselves. Perhaps they will be able to better understand some of what was written."
884,"A Quota to Meet : Mountainfoot iron is a brittle alloy, but with the right bribes it meets goblin safety standards. Zignibble here is having trouble on the production end of things, but that doesn't change any of my deadlines. I've got a quota to fill!Head down into the Mountainfoot Strip Mine and gather up any ingots of Mountainfoot iron you find. There should be piles of it smelted and ready for shipment."
885,Pro-liberation : I knew these guys would be trouble as soon as we started building this tower. Scoffing our bribes. Stealing our workers.Labor isn't cheap with all the construction in Azshara. I need those men back!
886,"Shared Goals : The decree you found made mention of a plan to defeat the Old Gods.   I know that the Amathet aren't likely to work with us toward that goal, but if they have a plan tae take out N'Zoth, it's worthwhile for us tae look at it.  The decree mentions the Engine of Ascension. I think that might be what they call that solar empowering device we saw earlier. We should take a peek underneath and see if we can figure out what they're planning!"
887,"Vindicator's Rest : I would not ask you to single-handedly bear the burden of destroying the Vector Coil and slaying Sironas, <name>; however, I believe that you can be of some help in clearing the way for others that might take on such a dangerous assignment.Take the road going north out of Blood Watch and follow it until you get to the fork. Once there, take the left road and follow it until you see Vindicator's Rest - it will be slightly west of the road itself. Corin will be waiting for you."
888,"High Chief Winterfall : The Winterfall furbolg are not a normally aggressive tribe, and this change in their behavior leads me to think that they must be under orders from their chief. We most likely can't undo the damage that has already been done, but if their leader is slain, they may not get any worse.Head east again, past where you found that cauldron. High Chief Winterfall is here, at the easternmost part of Timbermaw Post."
889,"Terrapination : We need to obtain the object described in this journal, for certain. Extracting it from a chest would be a feasible matter, but the object itself sounds compromised, and unstable. Attempting to forcefully open the chest could be disastrous.Fortunately, we know where the key is...statistically speaking, at least. There's plenty of sea turtles at the east end of this beach. One of them may hold the key."
890,"Wanted - Deathclasp, Terror of the Sands : The terrible scorpid, Deathclasp, is believed to have retreated to the southern mountain range in the presence of increased silithid activity.  She presents a great threat to patrols and expeditions in the southern regions.  Individuals participating in her destruction will be remunerated handsomely.  Inquire with Captain Vish Kozus, at the top of the Cenarion Hold Watchtower, regarding a reward."
891,"Mission Improbable : I have a special mission that requires a well equipped, competent <class>. As I have no one else to spare, I suppose I'll have to settle for you...The enemy has assaulted Warsong Lumber Camp and cut it off from the rest of our forces. An important blood elf diplomat en route to Orgrimmar is trapped there.She must be liberated.Take the road northeast and light the smoldering brazier to summon our operative there. Do whatever he might require of you.Dismissed!"
892,"The Ascended : These shaman have spent their lives dedicated to the path of Air, Water or Fire.  On your request, we will beseech the elements to Ascend them, becoming a powerful, if short lived, force to deploy in this war against the Legion.  The ritual of ascension is not to be requested lightly."
893,"Shroud of the Makers : It is good to have friends, <class>! While kindness is its own reward, there can be tangible benefits too!Some friends of mine recently intercepted a shipment of Schnottz's plunder and found something that should serve your needs nicely.It's a piece of titan technology that renders the user nearly invisible. If you use it in the enemy camp, you might be able to rewire their explosives and make a mess of their operation.Each charge has a limited duration, so don't stray too far from safety!"
894,"Daelin's Men : Reddon... Redpath... Ah, here it is! Lieutenant Paval Reethe.Joined the Theramore guard along with most of the recruits that came across the sea with Lady Proudmoore. Enlisted with the marines of Kul Tiras at the age of sixteen. Distinguished service, promotions...Listed as missing."
895,"Gathering Leather : Greetings, young one.  You have a gleam in your eye; I can tell you are eager to venture back to the plains for the hunt.  May you bring honor to your clan!I work with the skins of beasts, fashioning them into clothes and armor for the people of Thunder Bluff.If you hunt beasts and bring me their skins, then I will fashion something for you."
896,"Sweeping the Shelf : Wonderful work in the hovel, <name>. I prayed at the shrine while you were away, and in my visions, Goldrinn was watching you closely.But we've been on the defensive too long: it's time to foil the Twilight's Hammer directly.Fly up to the Lightning Ledge and disrupt their operation. Kill the stormcallers and the monstrosities they're preparing to unleash!"
897,"The Return of Baron Geddon : Ragnaros is not the only powerful elemental that has re-emerged into our world.The dreaded Baron Geddon is leading the onslaught and we must put an end to this rampage.The Flameseer's Staff has proven powerful.  Perhaps it is powerful enough to weaken him to the point where our arch druids can bind him where he stands.Go, <name> and be careful.  Baron Geddon is a vengeful and treacherous being."
898,"Beasts of the Apocalypse! : My brother and I were hunting in the woods to the east when we were ambushed by strange, insect-like beasts. Such aberrations have never before been seen in Azuremyst! Could they be a sign of the coming apocalypse? The apocalypse that YOU are destined to prevent?If you truly are the Promised One, you will strike the creatures of the apocalypse down... and bring me their hides. From their hides, I can fashion armor of great power!Find them to the east, beyond the road."
899,"Into the Fray! : For untold generations, the centaur clans have fought against one another, but no more.Because of your deeds, we stand here together fighting a common foe. We shall win our ancestral lands back from these demons, or we shall die as brothers.What of you, <name>?You have earned the right to fight alongside us. I have a group of my best centaurs for you to lead into battle.Will you take up the spear?"
900,"Even More Fuel for the Zapping : If I bet against my own better judgment and stay to run an engineering shop along the Forgotten Coast, I will need to deal with these pesky elementals.  Curse the powers of elementalism unchecked, I say!Fortunately for me, and now for you my hopeful agent provocateur, the elementals represent an ideal source of raw power for my Ultra-Shrinker refinement - give them the what-for I say!  When doing this though, be sure to save me the water elemental cores!"
901,"Nolkai's Words : The translation is ready now, <name>.<Anchorite Paetheus points out a block of text at the end of his translation.>'The enemy is nearly upon us. We've gathered up all the survivors and retreated to the temple to the east. It's the last ground we truly hold on the island, and there is a sense among the survivors that we will make our last stand here. I've taken care to bury my last few possessions on the grounds of the temple, with the hope that someone will find them and know what happened here.'"
902,The Eye of All Storms : Twilight riders circle the skies above the vortex.  I fear it is their magic that has kept the cataclysmic forces from being contained by our efforts.Take to the skies with Thessera and destroy the riders and the portal from whence they came.
903,Commander Jarod Shadowsong : Only once has there been a leader capable of commanding demigods and mortals alike.His name was Jarod Shadowsong and his ability to lead in battle was such that Cenarius and the other ancients placed themselves under his command.He disappeared for years and his whereabouts were unknown.  Until now.He is being held captive inside a Twilight camp in Darkwhisper Gorge.Your job is to infiltrate their ranks and free Jarod.  Speak to the one known as Ortell at Darkwhisper Pass to the southeast.
904,"Declaration of Power : Have you seen the serpent men? The ones that call themselves naga?<Kessel spits.>They dared make an advance upon this camp under cover of darkness only three nights ago. Can you believe the audacity of those primitive beasts?I need you to deliver a message to their leadership, <name>. To the northeast is Wrathscale Lair, home to Lord Xiz. Find him, slay him where he stands and drive this banner through his corpse.Let them know fear whenever they should see our standard!"
905,"The Codex of Shadows : <This elaborate book contains hundreds of vellum pages bound within a slate cover. It's written in many languages, most unfamiliar. Carefully inked illustrations depict sorcerers or even entire buildings vanishing into curtains of shadow.><Many illustrations depict magical artifices like those you see around camp. You suspect the dragon Sethria is trying to keep something hidden. Thisalee will want to hear about this!>"
906,"In Defense of Krom'gar Fortress : There's no time left. Here they come! Take control of a heavy gun and shoot the gnomes out of the sky! If that bomb takes too many hits it will blow, taking us all with it!Defend the base, <name>! You're our only hope!If we somehow make it out of this in one piece, report to Overlord Krom'gar."
907,"The Turd Problem : We have a little problem...<Jibbly points to the large turds covering the base.>We built the Sludgewerks near a wyvern habitat. Now our initial blueprints for the Sludgewerks were drawn up so as not to disturb the wyvern habitat as the beasts are apparently sacred to tauren and orcs. Do you know what's sacred to me? Not getting pooped on, that's what!Between you, me and the wall, the wyvern must die!"
908,"Do Me a Favor? : Hello there. Pleased to meet you! I'm Fizzle Brassbolts. Welcome to my Speedbarge.I share your concerns about helping all of Thousand Needles. It's my firm belief that the Speedbarge is the best hope for the entire region.Perhaps you could help us out a little bit here? I'll make sure that you're equipped with what you need to tackle everything else.As to that, if you could just run this list of parts over to Jinky Twizzlefixxit in her shop, you'll be well on your way."
909,"Repel Boarders! : <name>, the sea is our only lifeline, and right now most of my fleet is either steaming back to Theramore for repairs or rusting at the bottom of this bay. Only the Blackpool remains afloat to defend our harbor.But she's just signaled that she's being boarded!Speak to me when you're ready, I'll have one of our naval gryphons deposit you right on the deck. Slaughter the rageroar sea dogs who dare assault my precious ship and report to Captain Fisher for further orders."
910,"Altered Beasts : We, the blue dragons, have been forced out of our home, Mazthoril. An impostor by the name of Umbranse has taken advantage of us in our weakest hour, and now occupies the cave.Mazthoril is a place of extremely potent magic, and he does not know how to wield it. Even the wildlife suffers.The beasts nearby have been altered. Please, <race>, I must ask you a favor. Gather their brains, so I can see if I can undo this Umbranse's wild magic."
911,"The Arcane Storm Within : Mazthoril's innate magic can wreak unimaginable havoc if mishandled. Umbranse's wanton casting within the cavern has opened up a number of tesseracts - in other words, portals - connecting to other worlds. If I am to return to Mazthoril, these tesseracts must be closed.The dreamcatcher will close the portals, buying you safe entrance into Umbranse's lair. First defeat whatever comes out of the tesseracts, then use the dreamcatcher to quickly close them, before anything else spills into this world."
912,"Loss Reduction : You've got to help us.  The elementals... they're stronger than they look, and they come in waves.  They took us completely by surprise, and we were overcome.Many of my fellow grunts lay dying on the beach.  If you could save them... I would be grateful, as would Gar'Thok back in Razor Hill."
913,"He Who Would Be Forgiven : <A voice from inside the moonwell flows over your mind, bringing you a perfect sense of peace.>You seek to cure a child, but know that all things come at a cost. To the east lies Raynewood Tower. Standing outside the tower, next to my moonwell, is one who has fallen into corruption.Avrus Illwhisper seeks forgiveness and redemption, <name>. Will you help him to attain that which he desires and in so doing achieve your own goal?"
914,Army of the Black Dragon : Mok'Morokk was made Overlord by Rexxar. He care more for power than he care for ogres.Black dragons kill many ogre. Kill Tharg's wife. Mok'Morokk tell us to run. Make us come here.Ogre should fight. Ogres not good at running. Mok'Morokk care only about Mok'Morokk.Me call Stonemaul Ruins home. Me like it in the south. This place not home.Help ogres fight army of the black dragon. Me want revenge. Me want to go home.
915,"The Doomstone : At the core of Animus is an artifact known as the Doomstone. One of its properties is an ability to absorb a great deal of energy.This is how the cultists are trying to set off the explosion... by overloading the stone and amplifying the power through the elemental.Bring me the Doomstone. For safe keeping, of course."
916,"Flight to Razor Hill : When you're ready to take the wind rider down to Razor Hill, simply speak with me again. When you get there, waste no time in finding Gar'Thok. He's the one responsible for preparing reports on recent Alliance activity in Durotar."

918,"Translation : It is true that Furien dedicated his last days to a special research project. What that was, he would not share with me.Fortunately, I was able to recover his journal, but it's written in a code that I cannot decipher.Perhaps there is a clue to its translation in the region to the east where he spent his time.Take the journal, <class>, and speak with Narimar when you are ready to investigate this mystery."
919,"Bad Datas : There should be two titan communication devices in this chamber.If my translations are correct, one is a death trap and the other will accept the codes and activate the obelisk.Let's hope I get this right.Let me know when you're ready."

921,"The Land Is in Their Blood : If we're to stabilize the forces of nature, we'll need every little bit of help we can get.  The furbolg of the Blackwood tribe have long inhabited the area and have strong ties to the land.Their elder Shaman, Elder Brownpaw, wields great power over the elements -- his assistance would be invaluable.  See if you can obtain their aid."
922,"Secrets of the Flame : If we are to banish Ragnaros back into the Firelands, we will need to gain access to Sulfuron Spire.Only the most trusted members of the Twilight's Hammer will have been entrusted with such valuable information.Go search the Ascendant's Rise for any written tomes you might find.  Foul as they are, we cannot waste the opportunity to learn about our enemy's weaknesses."
923,
924,"Cutting a Path : During our mission to reconnoiter the Sunhawks and their portal, I sustained a serious wound. Scout Loryi has managed to staunch the bleeding and she's trying to figure out a way to evacuate me to Blood Watch.The problem is that we'd have to abandon our position here in order to guarantee a safe return.As soon as we leave this consecrated ground, we'll be set upon by ravagers. If you can clear some of the enraged ravagers, it might allow us to make the trip back safely."
925,"Slap and Cap : Oh for... not again! If you heard the deputy yelling out there, that means we've got a fullblown oil leak on our hands! It's those filthy worgen again!Listen, it's going to be total chaos out there. Sleep-deprived goblins running around screaming and not knowing what to do. I need you to snap the workers back to their senses.A good, swift backhand across the face should do it! Once they shake themselves off, they'll get to work capping those gushers!"
926,"Hammer Time : The three of us have been arguing for weeks over whose weapons are superior.I won't let anyone tell me my maces are second best. Kilram's axes and Seril's swords could never match the pure strength of my craft.I'm tired of arguing. It's time to show those two I'm right with a demonstration. If you would, dear, head outside and tell Deez Rocksnitch that I need the biggest boulder he can find!"
927,The Perfect Horns : I can't make a yeti without horns!I've been looking for what seems like forever for the perfect set of horns... and no horn I find is good enough! But just the other day I saw the biggest yeti in Winterspring.I named him Icewhomp. His horns are the ones I've been looking for! He lurks all the way in the back of the cave along the eastern ridge of Ice Thistle Hills.Bring me his horns... but be sure to check on Echo Three along the way!
928,"The Grand Tablet : At the bottom of the chest, you find a large tablet. Made of a material resembling stone, but completely smooth and flawless, it is covered in strange writing.While some resembles the writing on the walls, other scripts appear completely different. Gunstan would probably like to see this."
929,"Return Fire : The fires are mostly contained, but we have to do something about those wind riders!Quick, <name>, you have to jump into one of our glaive throwers and return fire!"
930,"In Fungus We Trust : I've cultured these unusual spores you dug up with a most magnificent cocktail of ... reagents ... that I'm fond of. I'm eager to see how my manipulated spores react to the waters of the Crossroads oases.The Stagnant Oasis to the southeast should provide us an uncontaminated site for our experiment. Simply plant this culture in the moist soil anywhere near the oasis, and document the results for me.Be sure to cover your mouth, <class>.<Helbrim grins disarmingly.>"
931,"Desert Research : The dark blade of Sargeras has cast a shadow of destruction over this land.  It seemed that the silithid hives were destroyed in the attack, but I have received reports that the silithid are returning.  If it were up to me, I'd burn those wretched hives once and for all! However, it is not up to me.  The Dark Lady wants the surviving silithid dissected and studied.   Pixni Rustbomb is conducting the research and is in need of a ""collector."""
932,"The Evil Dragons of Un'Goro Crater : This crater is filled with a malignant breed of dragon.  Have you seen them?  They wander all about, parading their spiky backs and lizardy faces all around the Crater.Don't let them fool you, squire, for these dragons are no minions of graceful Alexstrasza.  They are clearly vicious, and direly in need of a hero's blade.I have decided that I will slay no less than 15 of them.  As my squire, you must come along.  Should we become separated, you may meet me back here at the Hot Springs."
933,"Lockdown! : Zhat buildink did not explode by itself!Somevone is tryink to do me in, and you von't rest until I find out who!Shtaht vizh zhe guests. Visit vizh zhem, observe zheir demeanor, and zhen report back to me.If zhey know anyzhink at all, I vill haff zhem interrogated!Dismissed!"
934,"Sauranok Will Point the Way : I see you haven't yet spoken to the Warchiefs... other... advisor, Sauranok the Mystic. He has been at their side since our campaign together in Northrend.To assault the Twilight Highlands, we're going to need a map of the shoreline. I have tasked Sauranok with digging up this information. See if he can use your assistance!"
935,"Seek Redemption! : The Council of the Forest has news that you aided Zenn Foulhoof. The satyr is an enemy of the forest. As a <race>, you should know better than to defile the forest by killing Nature's creatures.You must redeem yourself in the eyes of the Council if you wish to remain a friend of Teldrassil.Teach Foulhoof a lesson and you shall be redeemed. Fel Cones are corrupted seeds that fall from the trees. They billow with green smoke.Give some to Foulhoof. He'll think you have brought him a harmless snack."
936,"The Lost Report : Sifting through the loose dirt, the severed hand of an orc is found.  And clutched in the hand is a bone-carved tube.  And in the tube is a dirt-stained parchment.The parchment is a report made by an orc who spent weeks spying on the city of Theramore.After scanning the parchment, it is clear that it must be brought to the orc spymaster in Brackenwall Village."
937,"A Grim Connection : I've spoken with Inspector Tarem regarding the evidence you gathered from the ruins of the Shady Rest Inn. He seems certain that the hoofprints and the shield you found there point to the Grimtotem clan of tauren.With reports of Grimtotem activity on the rise in the marsh, this has to be more than a mere coincidence. I'm sending you to speak with Captain Darill, who is something of an expert on the Grimtotems. Follow the road north out of town to North Point tower. It's the second outpost on the road."
938,"Smashing Through Ashes : <name>, these fiends from the Twilight's Hammer are attempting to scourge this whole mountain clean of all life. Even now they trail behind this inferno, leaving death and ash in their wake.Arch Druid Hamuul Runetotem is behind the fires, trying to salvage the wilderness before it's blotted permanently from the map. Travel southeast, through The Inferno and down the road beyond. Find and aid the Arch Druid.On your way there, clear the roads by killing any Charbringers that you find."
939,"A Hearty Thanks! : You saved my life, <name>! Thank you so much! That beast would have torn me to shreds if it weren't for you.If you see the exarch at Azure Watch, tell him of what you did. I'm sure he'll be pleased to hear such news!"
940,"Encased in Amber : You know who would probably know a lot about how to properly incubate this egg? The mantid!  Of course, they're too busy trying to kill us to share their expertise, but there might be another way to benefit from their knowledge!  Perhaps we could repurpose one of their incubation chambers. That could help speed up this process, I'm sure!  If you could find and mark one for me, I could airlift it out of there."
941,"The Bloodcurse Legacy : Dear friend,My hand trembles as I ink this letter. I pray that it reaches you in time.Last night, Edward Hanes, captain of the ship 'Lost Hope', appeared before me in my tent. The same Edward Hanes that died of scurvy 20 years ago.This apparition told me a tale that made my heart tremble. A tale that I need you to hear and a mission that I need you to accomplish. Will you do it? Will you seek out Edward on Wyrmscar Island, northeast of your base?Regards,Admiral Odesyus"
942,"Naga In Our Midst : The creature appears to have had its skull broken in a fight with Aros.  It looks like what you've heard described as a naga before.It is said that despite their monstrous features, naga are night elves warped by the arcane magic of Queen Azshara.It seems they've decided to stop you from obtaining the horn of the ancients."
943,"Da Voodoo: Stormer Heart : With voodoo, our troops might have a chance at beating back the Grimtotem assault. With that said, I need several ingredients if I am to invoke black magic.The first ingredient on my list is a heart from a cliff stormer. The beasts have nearly been hunted to extinction, but a few still exist around these parts. Find one and recover its beating heart!"
944,"Sowing a Solution : Based on what you've brought me, I think we may have a solution. I've imbued the lashvine seeds with healing energies.Simple contact with these should imbue the creatures here with enough energy to force out the corrupted influence.Go and attempt to heal the mutated raptors and plainstriders by sprinkling the seeds on them, and report the results back to me."
945,"Warchief's Command: Winterspring! : All able-bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Donova Snowden at Frostfire Hot Springs. Her discoveries about the Winterfall furbolg may be the key to dealing with this threat once and for all.To reach the Frostfire Hot Springs in Winterspring, you must travel east from northern Felwood and traverse Timbermaw Hold.Destiny calls!"
946,"Hero's Call: Felwood! : By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Tenell Leafrunner at the Emerald Sanctuary.His order requires your help to redeem Felwood from the demonic influences that rule the forest. Head north from Ashenvale and follow the road into Felwood until you reach the Emerald Sanctuary.For the glory and honor of the Alliance!"
947,"Marching On Our Stomachs : It's true what they say: An army marches on its stomach. And we've been marching a long way.I'm thinking if we barbecue up a few of those giant lumbering stormsnouts, we'll have enough meat to feed us for weeks.Stormsnouts are big and slow, so they should be easy to kill. Except... Hey you're not carrying any metal on you are you?"
948,"Culling the Furbolg Threat : Directly to the north of Astranaar are the Thistlefur furbolg. My scouts report that their numbers have grown greatly over the past few months. If they grow too great, they may find the courage to attack Astranaar directly!Go to Thistlefur Village and kill as many of their kind as you can.I shall remain here in Astranaar and await word from you. Elune be with you, <class>."
949,"Grimtotem in the Post : You must do away with the Grimtotem invaders at Freewind Post. They brought it on themselves, the cowards!We can't take the fight to their territory with our back to them. Please help us take back our home, <class>."
950,"Return to Samophlanger : Well, that didn't work. The structural integrity of the samophlange is at an all-time low. I could add some more dials to try and fix it, but...that might make things even worse.Look what I discovered when I blocked the release valve and blew the cover off the differential casing, though: the personal stamp of ""Boss Copperplug.""Take this back to Sputtervalve and tell him to find this Copperplug genius. When you're done here, just talk to me and I'll send you back using Brak's teleporter."
951,Grimtotem Chiefs: Grundig Darkcloud : One of the most accomplished Grimtotem leaders of the Stonetalon Mountains has returned home.We must make the most of this chance and put an end to his campaign of terror once and for all.
952,"Captain Vimes : Captain Vimes should see the orc report you found, <name>.  He knows the orcish language better than most.  And he should know that there are Horde spies near Theramore!The captain is in the barracks, on the northeastern side of Theramore Isle."
953,"Spirit of the Stag : In these woods reside three great spirits, that of the Stag, that of the Thistle Bear, and that of the Moonstalker. These spirits make powerful allies, but you can only align yourself with one of them.If you wish to align yourself with the Great Stag Spirit, take this incense to the woods just north of Bashal'Aran. Meditate before the great spirit while burning the incense on the ground between you, and face his trial to earn his blessing. Should you succeed, return to me."
954,"Rumble in the Lumber... Mill : Prepare yourself, <name>! The Warlord comes! Kill him and take his key. Use the key to release me.Should we make it out of here, report the following to Lord Fallowmere at Windshear Hold:The Horde has aborted their plans to destroy Windshear Hold due to the efforts of one of our heroes. They now plan to move the bomb to Battlescar Valley and drop it on our armies battling the Horde at that location.They must be stopped!"
955,"The Keystone Shard : The air around this strange stone crackles with energy. The stone itself is smooth and icy cold. It pulses periodically as you run your hands over it, like the crashing of surf.A wedge-shaped piece appears to be missing from the top surface of the artifact. This 'keystone shard' is likely the key to unlocking the secrets of the stone. Search the grounds near the temple and locate the keystone shard."
956,"Another Warm Body : Oh have I got a deal for you! Immerse yourself in foreign cultures, go on epic adventures, blow things up, and get paid to do it! Sound too good to be true? Well it's not - this is what we do!If you're interested, head over to Gallywix Defense Post on Forlorn Ridge to the north and look for Commander Molotov."
957,Tides of War : Champion!  An urgent War Council is underway. Your presence is requested in Stormwind Keep.
958,"In the Blink of an Eye : <The entity speaks with the familiar voice of Archmage Khadgar.>Azeroth needs you, <name>!After scouring Ulduar and Karazhan for answers, we know the key to defeating the Legion: five ancient artifacts called the Pillars of Creation.To find them, Dalaran must be moved to the Broken Isles. As our leader Jaina is... absent, Kalecgos of the blue dragonflight has offered the Kirin Tor his aid.The Legion is assaulting our current position over Deadwind Pass. Hurry!"
959,"The Nation of Kul Tiras : Kul Tiras is the greatest naval power on Azeroth, and a former member of the Alliance. But we've had little contact with them since Jaina's father, Lord Admiral Daelin Proudmoore, was killed at Theramore.  Many have said that Jaina believed so deeply in the promise of peace between the Alliance and Horde that she betrayed her own father on that day. Perhaps she feels it is time to put the past to rest.  Loathe as I am to put Jaina at risk... Kul Tiras must rejoin the Alliance.  Light be with you."
960,"Call of Duty : Citizen!As you may have heard, the Horde's attacking just offshore. The fighting's been fierce and relentless.We need every able body out there repelling the enemy!Report to the northernmost dock at once for transport to the battle.Oh, and our official warships are... err, a bit late in their scheduled return. Don't worry though, we've commissioned mercenary vessels to serve in the meantime.Hurry along now, <class>. Stormwind needs you!"

963,"CLUCK! : ""Cluck... cluck... cluck... BACAW!Cluck... cluck... cluck.""The chicken looks up at you and then starts to scratch its claws into the ground. You think it is spelling out a word, but you are not sure what it is. Could it be... S-A-L-D-E-A-N? Before you can ask, the chicken turns away and goes about its business."
964,"Devoured : We knew this was a possibility, but we had no idea how the beast would defend itself. Iso'rath's body is reacting quickly to our threat.I can complete the summoning from here, but only if you can hold back Iso'rath's defenses. Keep them busy! We will survive this!"
965,"The Final Voyage of the Brashtide : We'll never survive this attack with all these worgen pirates pouring into the harbor from the north.  Luckily, it looks like they're not armed with cannons, so if we can get you out of the harbor, you can attack from the skies.Kebok, the Horde flight master's assistant, is right around the corner.  Talk to him and let him know that you're going to need his bravest wind rider.Bring a couple armloads of handbombs with you.  You'll need all of them to stop those attack boats!"
966,"Looks Like a Tauren Pirate to Me : Firallon wants MY head?  Now that's interesting.  But it's nothing we can't work around.This Yancey character probably doesn't know my face too well.  Most non-tauren find us tauren indistinguishable from one another.  In fact... most non-tauren find us indistinguishable from... a certain four-legged farm creature.Rikqiz the leatherworker keeps one of these creatures here in Booty Bay, and Narkk is my chief supplier for pirate hats.  Get a replacement head and a hat, then return with both."
967,"Learn to Ride in the Eversong Woods : This pamphlet advertising riding training and mount purchases was sent from Perascamin.Perascamin can be found at Thuron's Livery, southeast of the Shepherd's Gate leaving Silvermoon City."
968,"A New Master... But Who? : You've arrived just in time.Here's the skinny: the Dark Iron dwarves in the gorge have been acting strangely, and the Thorium Brotherhood intends to find out why.  Overseer Oilfist doesn't like surprises.We suspect that they're following orders from some new leader.  I have reason to believe that Gravius Grimesilt, just south of here, knows who it is.Even here in Searing Gorge, we've begun to hear tales of your exploits, <name>.  You should have no problem with Grimesilt."
969,"Nespirah : It is clear to me at this point what must be done, <name>.The naga can only be obtaining these pearls from one place: Nespirah, the ancient, shelled creature that rests outside of this cave.  Why Nespirah would submit to the naga, however, is beyond my understanding.We can enter Nespirah's body cavity through a small tube near the exit to this cave.  I must first fetch my master, then we can meet you on the inside.  We will convene in Nespirah's northwestern entrance."
970,"Turning the Brashtide : The Brashtide are everywhere!  The Baron's Booty Bay Bruisers are no match for their sheer numbers, I'm afraid.While you're down here in the fray, why don't you help me get rid of a few of them?When you're done, don't bother coming back here.  I'll probably be pretty busy."
971,"Troll Juju : The corpses of trolls buried inside the Amani Catacombs have been rising from the dead! I want you to go there and bring back proof of their final demise. Some of these mummy trolls, and their living counterparts, carry juju; glowing objects that house an unknown power source.  It's probably what is animating them!The catacombs lie within Sungraze Peak, directly to the east. I am told that the easiest way in lies on the north face of the mountain. See to it, <class>!"
972,"Fuel-ology 101 : How much do you know about fuel, <name>?  Constructing the perfect fuel is a tricky job, as there's plenty of factors to balance: chrono-pyroxidation parameters, tempero-incendiary variables, conflagrational siltification criteria... and that's only naming a few.Hopefully the samples you brought me can be combined in the right proportions to create... the perfect bio-fuel.  Use that table over there and try combining some samples!  Bring the result to me when you're done."
973,"Hero's Call: Vashj'ir! : By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Recruiter Burns in Stormwind Harbor.Recent attacks by the Horde on our trade ships must be met with swift and just force!Stormwind Harbor can be found in the northwest region of Stormwind City.For the glory and honor of the Alliance!

976,"Belmont's Report : <Belmont hands you a sealed envelope.>Deliver this report to Lady Sylvanas Windrunner. It is my assessment of the situation in Silverpine based upon your and Yorick's field work.If we do not stamp out the worgen insurgents, they will overrun us. The time to act is now!"
977,"Prisoners of War : The Bravo Company field kit is ready, <name>. I'm gonna equip you with it and you're gonna enter Render's Valley, southeast of here, and free our P.O.W.s.  I'm sending Jorgensen with you to watch your back.Now the prisoners are being held on the northeast side of the valley in a large cage, but the key to the cage is in a cave on the south side of the valley. You'll have to steal the key, create a distraction, and free the citizens.Good luck, <name>! I'll be in touch through the field kit."
978,"An Old Sea Dog : This old, weathered coin was found on the body of the pirate ""Good-Boy"" Bruce.  Its front side bears the image of a large, unfamiliar pirate ship; on its back side, the term ""Brashtide Crew"".Someone who has been in the piracy business for some time might know what this coin is, or what it means."
979,"The Perenolde Tiara : The Perenolde Tiara is an old heirloom of the Perenolde ""nobles"" - the ruling family of Alterac before that kingdom fell to ruin.  It is said to have been crafted by master jewelers in Ironforge, and fitted with the finest of emeralds.When Alterac was destroyed the Tiara was lost, but there are rumors that an Ogre Mage, Grel'borg the Miser, found the tiara and now wanders the Ruins of Alterac searching for more treasures.We would have you acquire the tiara for us."
980,"The Damsel's (Bad) Luck : I heard that this ship here is the Damsel's Luck.  Didn't you used to be the captain of that thing?  You must know your way around it, then.The Brashtide are our main concern, but we still don't want to take an unnecessary pummeling from those cannons of theirs.  Grab this rope behind me and take out some of those angry-looking corsairs.  Check in with the Baron when you're done."
981,"Entombed in Ice : Khurgorn tells me the cataclysm upset the balance of the elements all over the world. Helm's Bed Lake, to the south, used to be beautiful and tranquil, but it is now overrun with agitated water elementals. When they started to leave the confines of the lake, I sent my troops in to keep them busy, but most have been frozen in blocks of ice.If we can break them free, they have a good chance of recovering. I cannot spare the men for a second expedition out onto the lake. Would you be willing to try?"
982,"Dark Ministry : I got one more assignment for ye.  This one comes straight down from the Overseer himself.  Seems he was pretty shook up once he heard about that ""Archduke"" ye discovered.He's asked for us to hunt down three Twilight ministers that work over in Firewatch Ridge, to the west.  Kiyuubi, Letherio, and Finister are their names, and they each carry some sort o' special rock.  Combine all three and bring 'em back here.Listen, when the Overseer gives orders, ye don't ask questions.  Ye just do it."
983,"Prepare for Takeoff : I've got an idea, but it's going to involve some footwork on your part.  As a goblin cartel, the Blackwater Raiders have a lot of explosives on hand.  In fact, I know for a fact that our old friend Narkk keeps a case in the back of his shop, in the Old Port Authority.Go grab them and bring them here, if they haven't already exploded."
984,"The Abyssal Ride : If you are going to be making it anywhere in this kelp forest, we need to get you a reliable mount. I think I've come up with a better plan than the sea turtle, and it's not far.Tie off a lure at the rope just west of us, and then mount the seahorse that it will attract.Be warned, you may need to work hard to break the beast."
985,"Seeking Seahorn : When the Brashtide pulled in, Seahorn grabbed the nearest weapon he could find and jumped off the ledge here.  You'll find him down below, probably pounding new holes into those worgen's skulls.Help him out down there.  I can handle the motivation from up here."
986,"Continue to Stormwind : For a small fee, you can take a gryphon to Stormwind, so you can deliver Argus' note to Osric.  You won't get there faster any other way.If that sounds acceptable, then just speak to me again when you're ready for the ride.  I'll charge you a little, but trust me; it'll be worth it!"
987,"Saltheril's Haven : I swear that I'm going to fireball someone if I get one more request from Lord Saltheril concerning supplies for his party!  Do I look like a party planner?!  Between you and me, that fool and his sycophants are living in denial that we're under attack here!Some of us are actually busy with, oh, I don't know, defending what's left of Quel'Thalas!  <class>, would you please head over to Saltheril's Haven and see if you can shut him up?  It's just down the road to the west."
988,"Rasha'krak : Based on this information you've delivered, I believe that one of this ""Archduke's"" minions may already have turned its eyes toward Thorium Point.His name is Rasha'krak, and he patrols the lava pools just to our south.  He looks like the latent fire elementals that rage nearby, except for one small difference: the bracers of binding that encircle his wrists.Find him and bring these bracers to me, <name>.  I need proof that we are in danger before we involve ourselves in elemental wars."
989,"Bwemba's Spirit : Dese be troublin' times for us Darkspear.  Da Zandalar be reuniting all da troll clans an' plan to take back da lands dey lost.We tryin' to warn all dat we can.

You're to get in the Bravo Company siege tank and clear a path to Keeshan's Post on the other side of the valley, north of here.This is a high alert situation soldier as the Blackrock orcs are now aware of your location and sending a large force to meet you head on. Terminate them all with extreme prejudice.I'll see you on the other side. May the Light have mercy on your soul."
991,"The Crucible of Carnage: The Twilight Terror! : We've got someone you'll really love to hate this time around. I wasn't sure at first if I should let him into the pit, but a fight's a fight! And who am I to turn down some guaranteed cash?!This guy hails from the Twilight Citadel itself, and comes toting a toasty punch. Better move fast and watch your back! Just give me the word when you're ready for some action."
992,"Battle for Azeroth: Tides of War : King Wrynn has called us together for an urgent war council.  It seems that there was some trouble with the Horde while we were away.

993,"The Terrors of Iso'rath : We need you! You were stuck in some kind of nightmare. So are many of the other shaman.It doesn't matter... our plan is falling apart. Some of our shaman are channeling protective auras that should combat the digestive juices and keep you alive, but we need you to rescue the other shaman from the tentacles.  We won't be able to defeat Iso'rath without them!Don't stay out in the stomach without the other shaman for too long or you'll be digested alive!"
994,"Avast Ye, Admiral! : Listen close, sea dawg... the powers of Booty Bay is what keeps us Bloodsail from sailing wheres we like and taking whats we want as rights o' plunder.  Were ye to put a knife to Fleet Master Seahorn, we'd ne'er run afoul of a Booty Bay's vessel.  Were ye to put a knife to Baron Revilgaz, we'd ne'er face the law on their terms.If ye are to be an honorary admiral amongst us - yes, ADMIRAL, you'll puts a knife to both of 'em as I've says.  Go now <lad/lass>, and return to me once ye does the deeds."

996,"Twilight Shores : The time has come, <class>. With Stormwind secure, we will take this fight to the enemy. To the Highlands!The bulk of our navy has already shipped out, thanks to your work earlier. But Fargo Flintlocke has prepared a seaplane that can make the journey in double-time.Speak with Flintlocke down at the harbor and tell him that you are to accompany him to the Highlands. He will be by the water's edge. Safe journeys, <name>."
997,"City Under Siege : <Khadgar's voice erupts from the elemental once again.>Obtaining information on the Pillars of Creation before the Legion could stop us was a considerable victory. It won't bring back those we lost on the Broken Shore, but I believe it will help us avenge them.Dalaran has become a focal point of the Legion's assault. Your presence here is crucial. If the demons are putting this much effort into attacking the city, it means Dalaran will play a pivotal role in the struggle to save Azeroth."
998,"The Future of Gnomeregan : It's a victory for us every time we're able to help another survivor escape from the contaminated halls of Gnomeregan. <class>s like you will play an important part in the future of Gnomeregan. To that end, our leader, High Tinker Mekkatorque, has assembled a team of trainers to help you learn your arts.Muffinus Chromebrew will help oversee your training and adjustment to life on the surface. He's waiting for you on the stands across the road."
999,"Some Good Will Come : So much violence, so much death.  Brothers have died, a mother has died, and now a panther cub will die if there is no one to take care of it.Will you take a break from the violence and help care for a panther cub?"
1000,"The Perfect Fuel : How much do you know about fuel, <name>?  Constructing the perfect fuel is a tricky job, as there's plenty of factors to balance: chrono-pyroxidation parameters, tempero-incendiary variables, conflagrational siltification criteria... and that's only naming a few.Hopefully the samples you brought me can be combined in the right proportions to create... the perfect bio-fuel.  Use that table over there and try combining some samples!  Bring the result to me when you're done."
1001,"Rise of the Brotherhood : I had no idea that VanCleef had a daughter, <name>. If there was one thing that man was exceptionally skilled at, it was keeping secrets.How tragic. Poor thing witnessed a horrible act. Had I only known.What was that? Did you hear something? It seems as if the gnolls are pulling back... where are my guards?ON GUARD, <name>!"
1002,"A Magnanimous Benefactor : You've done so much for us, <name>.  We greatly appreciate your assistance.You might have noticed Anchorite Ayuri's efforts outside.  She has a big heart and is very convincing, but the donations do not quite add up to what she had expected.If you were to make a large contribution to her cause, I will make sure that word of your deeds in this war spreads far and wide.  What do you say?"
1003,"Saving Foreman Oslow : <Upon touching the orb you hear a faint click.><You remove the orb from the pedestal.><You now control the orb, therefore you now control the ettins. Maybe you can use an ettin to remove the huge boulder currently crushing Foreman Oslow over at Lakeshire. Find an ettin and use the orb on the ettin. Then head over to Lakeshire.>"
1004,"Lunk's Adventure: Cranky Little Dwarfs : What you doing?  Why you kill?You need to get things from dwarfs?  Ah, Lunk understand.  Lunk have a better way.Listen: you go fight dwarf, but do not kill!  Just fight until dwarf get tired.  Then Lunk will help dwarf fall asleep.  Dwarfs probably just cranky because they don't get sleep.Come on!  Trust Lunk."
1005,Lawn of the Dead : IT'S STILLWATER! HE'S ALMOST HERE! It's going to take everything that we've got to beat him! Let's do this!

For the glory and honor of the Alliance!"
1007,"Bloodsail's End : We've nearly won the day, largely thanks to you.  One task remains, however... kill Fleet Master Firallon.It looks like most of Firallon's crew is already dead, but I know that old sea dog well enough to know that he's not done yet.  No, he's cooped up tight in his cabin, ready to go down with his ship.Speak with Kebok again to get a wind rider.  I'll try to hold off the cannonfire while you're on board."
1008,"Argent Call: The Trial of the Crypt : Behind our chapel, you will find a small crypt.  Interred within are the bodies of our fallen heroes; those who gave their lives in the war against the Scourge.Their spirits are at peace, but they return intermittently to test new members of the order.The three of you may test together.  Enter the crypt, then read from this scroll.  Lord Raymond George - my predecessor - will preside over your test."
1009,"Report to the King : We have slowed the Iron Horde down, but this war is far from over... I'll stay here and continue our efforts to hold back the Iron Horde.The King needs to know about what we have accomplished here today, and the threat we face in the future.It is probably best if you report to King Wrynn yourself, <name>."
1010,"Get to the Airfield : According to the plans you captured, the Dark Irons are planning a large-scale attack on the Ironforge Airfield! The council has moved most of our forces down into Dun Morogh to deal with the instability brought by the cataclysm, leaving our defenses weakened at the airfield.We need a way to get you to the airfield quickly. Take the road back west toward Gol'Bolar Quarry and find Mathel Rustwrench. He should have a flying machine you can use. Go!"
1011,"A Dish Best Served Huge : Take this food, and put it in our old lifeboat, southeast of here along the coast.  When Negolash smells all that food, he'll come running!And when he does, there will be a stouthearted <class> ready to knock his corpse back into the briny deep."
1012,
1013,"Mor'Ladim : From what my scouts tell me, Mor'Ladim wanders throughout Duskwood, following a strange and meandering path through the cemetery. We buried him out past the house on the hill, you know where that is?There isn't anything I can do to help you, but I wish you good luck."
1014,"Be Raptor : Mind Control, very powerful, yes.With luck, you can help Ohgan'aka escape from Zul'Gurub.Then, Ohgan'aka becomes <name>'aka again!Speak to Priestess, yes, and help <name>'aka escape."

I am now giving you full control over her abilities, <name>.Roaming around the farm's outskirts, you should find several of the Forsaken that you just created.  I want you to use your val'kyr to gather at least five of them.  Once you have done so, take your newly-formed band of soldiers, bring them into Felstone's barn, and kill the beast inside.  Today, they will learn what it means to fight for the Dark Lady."
1016,"Flame Crest : Our work here in Chiselgrip is done, mostly thanks to you.  We'll now be moving on to the northeast, to Flame Crest.Flame Crest is in the cliffs, past the Ruins of Thaurissan.  It should serve as a sufficient base of operations for the final stages of our plan.Of course, my son Ariok will be joining you on the road.  As will I."
1017,"Dig-Boss Dinwhisker : Grimesilt wasn't as high up on the chain as I thought.  We'll have to take out his superior and find out what he knows.Dig-Boss Dinwhisker's his name, and he runs the Dark Iron digging operations within the Cauldron, just northwest of here.  His excavators and footmen patrol the eastern side of the Cauldron, digging downward, day and night.He's not known to show his face out in the field very often, but if you slay enough of his men, he'll be forced to come out and deal with you."
1018,"Warning Orgrimmar : We have slowed the Iron Horde down, but this war is far from over... I'll stay here and continue our efforts to hold back the Iron Horde.The Warchief needs to know about what we have accomplished here today, and the threat we face in the future.It is probably best if you report to High Overlord Saurfang yourself, <class>."
1019,"Thalorien Dawnseeker : If you truly bear Quel'Delar, <name>, I might be able to admit you to the Sunwell. If you know the blade's history, you recall that it was borne by Thalorien Dawnseeker in defense of the Sunwell against the Scourge. He fell in what is now the Dead Scar, buying time for his men to make their own preparations. You will find his remains near the southern end of the Dead Scar on this isle. Visit them, and if his spirit gives you its blessing, I will allow you to enter the Sunwell."
1020,"The Worldbreaker : There's no time! Deathwing struck before we could form against him. If you do not stop him, the Earthen Ring will end this day!"
1021,"Oh, the Insanity! : So, I've been thinkin'...If someone's out-of-their-mind-guano-crazy, do they know it?Case in point, I coulda swore that I'd collected a barrel of gunpowder from the cannonballs around here, but it's nowhere ta be found.I distinctly remember lifting the cannonballs from them Gilblins just west of here.Maybe they're right... maybe I really have lost it."
1022,"Rams on the Lam : The rams we raise and train here at Amberstill ranch have long been the mounts of choice for Dun Morogh's mountaineers. Aye, there're a few here, but not enough to guard my family and all the animals.A few brave Frostmane raiders have taken to stealing our rams under the cover of night, taking them south into the Tundrid Hills. Would you be willing to help return them? You'll need to get fairly close to them and give a sharp whistle to get their attention. Their training will take over from there."
1023,"A Daughter's Love : Here, take this and lay it on his grave. Maybe... somehow, he'll know that I'm okay, and that none of us hold him responsible for what happened.<There are tears in her eyes now, as she slides a ring from her right hand, and presses it into your hands.>And... thank you, <name>."

1025,"Kill-Collect : There's three phases to debt collecting: asking nicely, asking forcefully, and something I like to call ""Phase Three"".Unfortunately, collecting during Phase Three is something that this old dog can't do any more.  That's why I employ so many cronies, stooges, mooks, goons, and noble adventurers like yourself!Juntz Fitztittle, Ephram Moonfall, and Maury Wilkins are hiding out on the eastern coast.  You should have no problem visiting them all in one trip... and bringing back their valuables."
1026,Endgame : We need to get rid of that flying gunship if our people have any chance of escaping.Here's the plan.  Keel Harbor had its share of rebel sympathizers in the old days.  I've managed to round up a hefty amount of incendiary explosives from one of our storehouses.We're going to hit the enemy with a force small enough to fly undetected.  The night elf hippogryphs should do the trick.Tobias will give you the signal when we're ready to go.
1027,"Calling of the Council : <The arcane anomaly turns to address you, speaking in what is clearly Khadgar's voice.>Though I am loathe to interrupt your fight against the Legion, I must request your help in a matter of... diplomacy. We face a grave threat, and we must be at our full strength to overcome it.Some will not agree with this position.Please join me outside the Violet Citadel in Dalaran.

My crafting table over there has all the necessary supplies on it.Go ahead and grab whatever you think is necessary, then bring it here.  Thelaron will fix you right up."
1029,"Undersea Inflation : Fine! Fine. You argued me into it. You can help.I'm leaking air worse than a zeppelin stuffed with quilboar! My air valve must have come loose somewhere in the trench.I brought spare air balloons - make yourself useful and go fill one up, will ya? And find my valve! I'll need that too.I bet the crabs snatched it up... pinchy, greedy little things."
1030,"WANTED: Thaelis the Hungerer : The city of Silvermoon hereby issues a reward for the head of Thaelis the Hungerer, notorious Wretched ringleader.

1031,
1032,"Up to Snuff : Ah, the sea life.  I ain't gonna say it's the good life, but it's my life.When I get into port I like to find me a good bottle of grog and some high quality snuff.  Nasty habits but what's a pirate without his vices, right?So you can imagine how heartbroken I was to find out the herbalist here in town has gone and sold out of the stuff.  Says his shipment got hijacked by those damned Bloodsail Raiders.I bet a fearless <class> like you could convince 'em to share the goods, eh?"
1033,Basic Botany : HELP! HELP! Crazed undead are attacking my farm! That psycho warden over at the Sludge Fields is probably responsible for this mess. Help me fight off the zombies!
1034,The Haunted Mills : You sense a malign presence coming from within the skull of the beast.  Coleman Farthing may be interested in seeing this.
1035,"Last of Her Kind : Obsidia is one of the last mature dragons that can continue the black dragonflight bloodline. She must be killed.If you succeed in killing her, you should inform Lirastrasza immediately of your victory. She's been fighting a long time to see this done.Thank you for being our fang in these battles. You've proven a powerful ally."
1036,Explorers' League Document (1 of 6) : The document bears the Explorers' League crest and contains extensive information on the indigenous creatures of Loch Modan. Sooty smudges lead you to believe it was likely stolen by the Dark Iron spies in the area.You recall mention of missing documents at the Explorers' League building in Thelsamar.
1037,"The Day that Deathwing Came: What Really Happened : These two have no idea how to tell a story.  Theldurin's story was too short, and Lucien's tale was a little too tall, if you catch my drift.Also, neither of their stories had action and fans admiring my awesomeness in them.Sit back, <name>.  I'll tell you what really happened that day."
1038,"A Delivery for Neeralak : The warlocks of the Blackrock Clan often practice their magic in the Skull Warren, a cave on the eastern side of Dreadmaul Rock.  Their leader, Xi'lun, is busy elsewhere, so the cave is currently being held by another of the Big Three: Dragon-Lord Neeralak.  And Neeralak's expertise is in dragons, not in necromancy.I've used the slumber sand on those flamekin you captured.  Try to convince Neeralak that they're warlock imps, and not flamekin.  When they wake up, they won't be happy."
1039,"Swift Discipline : I hope you learn a valuable lesson today, <name>.  Never trust someone else to lie for you.Now I want you to go back to my two dimwitted students and discipline them using this wand.  My magic tells me that you'll find them along the road to the west on the other side of the Dead Scar.Come back to me after you've done this.  I'll give you a small reward for your troubles."
1040,"Cry For The Moon : I'm hopeful, but let's remain professional. It's business as usual for this one.Into the guillotine he goes... and if the alchemy doesn't take, he won't be getting back out of it.Jitters and I will attend to this. Please, just stand back and watch from a safe distance."
1041,Stranglethorn Fever : Sick...so...very s-s-sick... have contracted Stranglethorn Fever.......technically... CAPE of Stranglethorn Fever.......deadly v-v-virus.......only cure... is... is... to eat the heart of M-m-m-m-mokk the Savage... elusive white beast.......Witch Doctor Unbagwa... only one who can s-s-summon.......seek Unbagwa in hidden cave on southern cape.......hurry... dying... dying....
1042,"Beer Basted Boar Ribs : Nothing my tavern patrons enjoy more than some Beer Basted Boar Ribs!  Only problem is, the local trapper who used to bring me supplies enlisted in the King's Army to help with the war on the Alliance front. Maybe you can help me out?  If you bring me some boar ribs and a Rhapsody Malt from the tavern here, I'll give you the family recipe for my famous Beer Basted Boar Ribs, not to mention a free sample!  The secret's in the Malt!"
1043,"Find OOX-09/HL! : You have uncovered some sort of strange, egg-shaped device made from metal.  Fiddling with one of its knobs springs the egg to life, as it opens up into some sort of gnomish robotic contraption!  A voice from inside the robotic egg crackles to life.""My name's Oglethorpe Obnoticus, and my homing robot has crashed!  I will reward you for its recovery; please take this beacon to the robot!""""I now have computed the coordinates of the robot for you; it crashed at the head of the river near Skulk Rock!"""
1044,"You Are Rakh'likh, Demon : Hero, listen well.First, we must travel to the Deathly Usher, who waits at the northern foot of the Rise of the Defiler, to our northeast.  The usher will take us to the top of the rise.  Once there, I need you to help me defeat Razelikh, for I fear that I am not strong enough to defeat him alone.Most importantly, I need you to hold the stone knife, and do not use it until I tell you to.  The knife will trap Razelikh's soul within its new, eternal prison.If we succeed, speak with Wazzik."
1045,"Some People Just Need Killing : The tunnel ahead, headin' west, will take you straight to Chief Prospector Hondo's office.  He's the big cheese around here, and Tak'arili's heard tell that he's a darn fine miner.  That's why he's gotta die.There's just one problem: the pathway is completely FILLED with those pesky Nethergarde flunkies.  That's why you gotta disguise yourself.  Hop inside this box here, and sneak down the pathway.  Hopefully you won't draw too much suspicion on your way to da killin'."
1046,"Heartstrike : We don't have any hope of taking the Nethergarde Mines from the Alliance... at least not yet.  Nethergarde is well-defended, and their supply routes are established and strong.  Our goal, then, is to damage their economy.  We can't take the mine by force, but with surgical strikes we can drastically reduce the mine's efficiency.I have men creating a distraction outside the mines.  Head east, sneak into the mines, and speak with Rofilian Dane for your assignment."
1047,"All or Nothing : This is it.This is where we make our stand.We must defend this ship to our last breath, and make these cretins think twice before approaching it again!May our blades strike fear in their hearts!"

A large gap still sits at the center of the holy symbol's head.><Once again you feel it tug your arm, urging you towards the hole in the wall and the winding tunnel ahead.

1049,
1050,"Death From Below : This is bad. It seems the Daggerspines are amassing for an attack.Naga are known for their ruthlessness in battle. They will keep attacking until I am dead.I don't value my own life above that of my crew members, but you must help to defend me. The crew will not be able to make it back to Booty Bay without my knowledge of the seas.The naga will be coming from the sea. I need you to remain up here with me to fend off the attack. Man the cannon and drive them back.Are you ready, <name>?"
1051,"Forced to Watch from Afar : The cataclysm drove the troggs to the surface in hordes, forcing the Frostmane trolls to flee for their lives. Unfortunately, they've decided to settle right on our doorstep and make trouble for us.I deployed Mountaineer Dunstan and his squad to the Grizzled Den just southwest of town to keep an eye on the wendigos that live there, but now I need to recall them to Kharanos. Find them and tell them to deploy those remote observation bots the gnomes provided, then return to Kharanos."
1052,"Heroes of Darrowshire : The heroes of Darrowshire held relics of their own, and inside of those relics lie more precious memories.First, speak with Carlin and obtain the Extended Annals of Darrowshire.  Within the tome lies the narrative that will drive our excursion through time.Then, you will need to head west to the Marris Stead.  The former owner of the Marris farmhouse collected relics from the battle of Darrowshire - for what reason, I am not certain.Gather these relics, and return to me."

Who you give what to is wholly at your discretion.When you're ready, mount up on my trusty skeletal steed - so they don't miss you - and start living the life! Which means just stand there and wait."
1054,"Dark Vessels : The Vilebranch trolls here used to drink the corrupted blood of the god Hakkar himself for power. They boiled it in crude pots before drinking, dark vessels full of unholy strength.Hakkar was killed long ago, of course. But the interesting thing... I still see some cauldrons bubbling up there. Bring me back a few and we'll see just what they've got cooking."
1055,"Do the Right Thing : You have come upon a horrific scene. Someone or something has buried all of the humans up to their necks in a manner consistent with planting. The ghouls, which are seemingly tending the field of human seedlings, periodically jump to the nearest human and devour its head!You can end this right here and now. Take this shovel and ""save"" the humans.Do the right thing."
1056,"Avast Ye, Scallywag : <name>... yeah, I've heard of you.  I've heard that you're no friend of Booty Bay - just like us Bloodsail Buccaneers.  Fleet Master Firallon is looking for hale and hearty <men/women> just like you for a special mission.If you're interested, head on out to the Crimson Veil and speak with him below decks.  She's anchored off the Wild Coast east of here, next to the Riptide and the Damsel's Luck."
1057,"A Curse We Cannot Lift : What we do here is not a cure. The transformation cannot be removed once inflicted. But the mind...The mind can be restored, through alchemy,  if enough is left intact. This worgen you've encountered sounds like he's fighting to stay aware, <name>. We've got to find him again.If he's fled the Yorgen Stead, search the Addle Stead to the south; he may be lurking in one of the buildings.Inject him with this ampule to tranquilize him. You'll need to be quite close."
1058,"Our Mortal Enemies : Hey, new <guy/girl>, take a look at this.<The dwarf flips up his eyepatch to reveal a living, functional eyeball.>I don't wear this patch because of any lost eye.  I wear it because this OTHER eye is so strong, the normal one was just weighin' it down.This eye's good for seein' all kinds of things, like those masked hooligans that follow us around.  Fleet Master says that they've been spotted over on Jaguero Isle.  Once you get there, fire this flare gun, and I'll help you spot 'em."
1059,"Keep Your Hands Off The Goods! : We've uncovered some incredible artifacts at this site. It's hard to be convinced that it's all authentic, but there could be serious historical potential.Unfortunately, when the troggs overran the site, we lost access to three of our most notable finds to date. I'm concerned that the troggs might have stolen them or defiled them in our absence.If you go into the excavation, find the Upturned Giant, the Overdressed Woman, and the Broken Tablet, and make sure they're still intact."
1060,"The Party Never Ends : I like to throw parties... just a little something to celebrate the magnificence that is Quel'Thalas!But, I'm in a bit of a bind.  I need you to gather up more party supplies.From Vinemaster Suntouched at the Silvermoon City inn, bring me a bottle of Suntouched Special Reserve.  From Zalene Firstlight at Farstrider Retreat acquire more of those delicious Springpaw Appetizers.

1064,"Big Game Hunter : <name>, you are a hunter worthy of our company.  From the battlefields of Lordaeron to the deepest jungle, I have rarely witnessed such prowess with weaponry as you have demonstrated.You have killed the ferocious Sin'Dall, the elusive Bhag'thera, and the treacherous Tethis.  But the true prize is the head of King Bangalash.  That white tiger is the reason I am here... yet still, he taunts me from his roost to the south.  Kill King Bangalash and your hunting prowess is proven to be second to none."
1065,"Lou's Parting Thoughts : A couple of thugs recently showed up at the farm, causin' all kinds of trouble. I don't know where they came from or who they're working for, but I KNOW they're bad news. I may have overheard 'em talkin' 'bout subjects that might interest you.If you're interested, you'll find the thugs back behind the farmhouse. If you get caught or killed, I don't know you. Never seen ya!Good luck, kid."
1066,"It's Goat Time, Baby : We have a little bit of a goat problem here in Fuselight, in case you haven't noticed.  They'll eat anything, and they seem to have taken a liking to the piles of cogs and gears that we tend to leave sitting around.It's getting really annoying!You'll find most of the billy goats wandering around the edge of town, near the cliff's edge.  Use this device on them to give 'em a little ""nudge""."
1067,"Watching Our Back : <Watch Commander Relthorn Netherwane speaks in hushed tones.>I have orders from... higher up... that you would be suitable for.  I've seen the Horde periodically referring to a stack of papers on that barrel over there.  I'd like you to take a look at those papers and find out what it is that they're plotting.  My duty and station prevent me from such a questionable task, but a newcomer like you might be able to slip in unnoticed..."
1068,"Return to the Highlands : With Orgrimmar secure and our Dragonmaw allies behind us, we can turn our attention to the conquest of the Twilight Highlands and the utter destruction of Deathwing's forces there.I need the Horde's best on the front lines. That means you. And all your friends.The Highlands WILL be ours!Use the new portal you created to return to Dragonmaw Port. Report to Zaela to see where she needs you the most."
1069,"The Day that Deathwing Came : Deathwing made quite a mess when he passed through these parts.  If it weren't for me, he'd probably still be here, layin' waste to all the good people of the Badlands.What, you don't believe me?  Fine, let me tell you the whole story."
1070,"The Fallen Lion : I haven't left the deck of this ship since we got back. The fleet must be made ready for war. Don't know where we will be needed, but when the call comes, we'll be ready.Truth be told... I welcome the distraction. The others are paying their respects to Varian, but I... I cannot bring myself to face that casket. To face his son.Varian gave me a letter he wrote to Anduin. Please, take it to him on my behalf."
1071,"Visions of the Past: The Invasion of Vashj'ir : The shard you recovered looks to be of naga origin. I had hoped to find a strong focal object like this for a spell I've been working on that would allow us to glimpse into the recent past.I've enchanted the blade, but you'll have to take it to a place where we know its owner was. I want you to travel back to the site where you found it and use the blade.Perhaps we can uncover more behind what the naga are doing here. Or even better, maybe we'll uncover a weakness that will give us a better chance."
1072,"Finite Numbers : It seems not all the protections I put in place have been defeated. The Legion isn't able to open portals inside or near the tower... at least, not yet.They appear to be bringing reinforcements in through the catacombs running beneath Deadwind Pass. Disable them and you just might buy us the time we need to drive them out of Karazhan."
1073,"Looking for Lurkers : I don't know about you, but I'm not much a fan of spiders, much less the kind that come bigger than me. Loch Modan's a gorgeous place, but I'd say it could do without those horrid things waltzing around.Tell you what, I've got some spare coin, and you look like a tough one. If you head out and off some of those things for me, I'll pay you for your time."
1074,"Undersea Sanctuary : I believe I've located the author of your note, friend.It would seem that he is in desperate need of attention if he is to survive.I shall attune one of my scrying orbs, that you might see him for yourself."
1075,"Gimme Shelter! : Please, <race>! You must help me!I've barely managed to survive, what with naga, sharks, and that horrible monster that attacked our ship.I can see a cave that might be safe, but I don't dare try to make it unless I know there's air inside.Can you make sure it's ok?"
1076,"Drive-By Piracy : Now that you know how to handle our cannons, it's time to hit some real targets!The Venture Company has found gold to the north of here... a rare type they call ""Black Gold"".  More like a Black Spot if you ask me.We're going to take that gold, but first, we need to get rid of those Venture Company goons.  I've got an oarsman who will take you out there.  Head off the ship down the gangplank and speak with him on the islet's northern shore."
1077,WANTED: Knucklerot and Luzran : A bounty is hereby declared for the abominations known as Knucklerot and Luzran.  These dreadful creations of Dar'Khan are extremely dangerous and have been sighted patrolling near the Howling and Bleeding Ziggurats.

1078,"The Embalmer's Revenge : You're not the first fool to be manipulated by Abercrombie! That doddering old man is known as The Embalmer to us.

Our supremacy over the Bloodsail is due largely in part to our stronghold here in Booty Bay, but intelligence also plays a critical role.The Bloodsail maintain a few meager camps to the south which they call their ""Southern Command.""  Well, you're going to raid their excuse for a southern command, find their plans, and slaughter their men.  Return with whatever information you can find."
1080,"Korok the Colossus : The monstrosity has fallen, granting a brief reprieve to the Forsaken soldiers on the front lines.Take Korok's second head and return it to Forward Commander Onslaught at Forsaken Forward Command."
1081,"Wake of Destruction : Our time here draws to a close. I must somehow follow the trail of these naga captives if we are to discover their purposes in this region.But before I move on, I would see the destruction of this operation!Nevermind their numbers, I have a plan that has the potential to even the odds.Outside this cave, famished great sharks, displaced by these naga, seek food.In their weakened state, they will be susceptible to suggestion. Use this orb to subdue them, then direct them against our enemy."
1082,"Illidari Allies : At first I was unsure whether it was wise to allow the Illidari inside the city. But they may have just saved all our lives.I gave the demon hunters leave to establish a temporary camp in the Mage Quarter. I'd like you to be my personal envoy to them. Thank the Illidari for their assistance and see how they can aid our cause.Just... keep your eyes open. They have harnessed a terrible power, and we must be ready should they be consumed by the darkness within."
1083,"Villains of Darrowshire : The Annals of Darrowshire tells of the villains of that battle.  It tells how the ghoul lord Horgus the Ravager was destroyed by Alliance forces during the battle.  He was slain among the foothills north of here, and his skull remains there.Marduk the Black was never defeated, but his fabled sword now rusts, ownerless.  It can be found near the road to our southeast.Retrieve these items, <name>.  I know not why, but I am certain their fate lies with you."
1084,"The Crucible of Carnage: The Bloodeye Bruiser! : Well well, if it isn't the once champion of anguish, <name>! I'm seeing good money in the future now that you're here! We're gonna be rollin in the dough, buddy! Filthy RICH!Anyway, this is some old Dragonmaw fighting pit. Didn't take much modification to tune it up to our uses. I put out a few feelers, and got some heavy hitters from all around Azeroth to join in the carnage. Bout time to make some gold!You know the drill, <name>. When you're ready, let me know and we'll get this show on the road!"
1085,"Stagwiches : Ever had a stagwich? Me neither. Apparently they're delicious. Now I'm not one for eating, but I am a businessman. If my customers want stagwiches, who am I to argue?You're probably asking yourself, ""What does this have to do with me?"" I'll tell you what, <class>, I need stag meat! You get me stag meat from the hill stags of Hillsbrad and I will pay you. Sounds like a pretty good deal, doesn't it?Get going! Stags are most plentiful to the west."
1086,"The Battle for Gilneas City : The time has come, <name>.  We've rallied and armed every available Gilnean.It is time to meet the enemy head on.  Time to settle the score with Sylvanas and her Forsaken dogs once and for all.Liam is heading the assault from this gate.  King Greymane and my father are leading the assault on the other districts.You have a crucial role to play in this as well.  Take this rapier.  Use it to inspire our men and women in combat.  Speak to Krennan Aranas to take part in the battle for Gilneas City."
1087,"SEVEN! YUP! : We have to take action.  Winky and Gor'tesh were fighting, so I planned this friendship ceremony to help the two of them make up.  Everything was going well, until...Well, you know the rest.I even bought drinks!Winky loves flameflies.  He runs off to chase them most every night.  I'm thinking maybe that's where he went.You'll find flameflies to the west and north, wherever you find lava.  Bring me seven of them, and hurry!Gor'tesh might leave next!"
1088,"Sea Legs : Welcome to The Briny Cutter, <class>.I am Erunak, the last surviving passenger of this once-proud vessel.I'm afraid your travails have only just begun. The naga have been attacking here relentlessly.You're not equipped to be of much help down here yet, but I can remedy that.Just outside this ship live a special breed of starfish. Bring me some of them along with a conch shell. I'll prepare an enchantment that should help to increase your chances of survival."
1089,"To Fuselight Proper : This, <race>, is paradise.  I've always wanted to live in a nice quiet town by the sea so I can focus on my explosions without any distractions.Quiet's not for everybody, though... 'specially the adventuring hero-type, like yourself.We've installed a teleporter in the backside of town that'll take you up to the top of the cliffs.  From there, you can take the quick ride west into Fuselight proper, within the Badlands.There should be more for you to do up there.  Tell 'em that Flo sent you."
1090,"A Giant's Feast : The next giant on my list is called Negolash.  I remember vividly how he leapt from the seafoam and plucked poor Poop-Deck Paul from the crow's nest.Swallowed him in one gulp, he did.  And snapped my mizzenmast in two on the way down.No man on my crew deserves such a heinous death.  So we're going to use Negolash's appetite against him.  Kelsey Yance should be able to sell you some meat, and Whiskey Slim has enough booze to knock out... well, a sea giant.  You'll find both of them in town."
1091,"Seeing Where Your Loyalties Lie : Thar be just one thing...Yancey hears things.  A few o' me hearties were pretty deep in their cups when they told me about some <race> <class> that came a-rollin' through the Southern Command lookin' for charts and orders.  Even ran a couple o' good pirates through, <he/she> did.Like I said, they were up to their eyeballs in grog, but still... a buccaneer's gotta trust his ears.  So I've just got one small task for ye, one sent down from Firallon hisself...Bring me the head of Fleet Master Seahorn."
1092,"Battle of Life and Death : Alexstrasza and Deathwing have taken into the skies over Grim Batol! Her plan unravels - the Dragon Queen is outside the Circle of Life she prepared earlier. We'll need to support her with everything we've got.Hurry! Climb aboard one of the Vermillion Vanguard behind me.If we find any Twilight Drakes aiding Deathwing, we will need to kill them off. Mount up, quickly!"
1093,"Ever So Lonely : You work hard your whole life, and what do you get?  Killed by a plague.  Then you work even harder in undeath, and what do you get?  Money, yes, and a small estate with a few pesky hangers-on, but happiness?  Not so much.I'm lonely in my old age, <name>.  I need a companion.  Use this leash on one of the murlocs at the Whispering Shore to the northwest.  You'll have to weaken it first before it can be leashed.  Then bring it back to me."
1094,"Scaring Shaky : If there's one thing I can't stand, it's people who don't pay their gambling debts!  And there are a lot of people who owe me.  Think you can help me collect?First, there's ""Shaky"" Phillipe down by the docks.  He owes me plenty after last week's game and I want my due!  But to get it, we'll have to scare him.Go out of town and hunt elder mistvale gorillas.  Find a nice selection of giblets, then take them to Shaky.  Don't let on that they're from an animal; let him think the worst."
1095,Resistance is Futile : <The F.C.D. buzzes.>This is Commander Lorna Crowley of the Gilneas Liberation Front. If you are hearing this message then you know that the Alliance once again controls Gilneas. Lay down your weapons and surrender. Failure to comply will result in your death.Our forces have locked on to your position and will arrive shortly. Resistance is futile.
1096,
1097,"Something Stolen : Everyone's going to want to dress their best for this, and finery is in short supply in the Highlands.I understand that those goblin wretches off the coast use the finest silk for repairing their zeppelin air envelopes. A waste!Find a zeppelin flying back and forth between Dragonmaw Port and the Krazzworks, and liberate some silk from the cargo hold in the lower decks."
1098,"Backdoor Dealings : Zanzil the Outcast, an exile from the Gurubashi tribe, is my quarry.  Recently, I have heard tales from my brothers in the north about his planned reentry into society, starting with the emissary he sent to the Skullsplitters.  This is not good news.I want you to peer into Zanzil's current plans.  Take this incense, and place it in front of the bat totem in the Ruins of Jubuwal, to the east.  Hir'eek will guide you from there."
1099,"Nida's Necklace : My friend Nida lost her necklace, and we can't find it.  We've been fishing all day right here, and we looked around here already.  The only thing I can think of is that it fell into the lake.  Our parents don't want us to swim in the lake... my mom says there's some mean things underwater, but you look like you aren't scared of mean things.Could you find it for her, please?"
1100,"Lunk's Adventure: Spider Rider : Lunk sees you like to kill things.  Let Lunk teach you another way.Lunk always wanted to ride on spider's back.  Looks like fun.  Spiders move too fast, though.  Always slip away.We work together.  You fight spider until it gets weak and tired.  Then Lunk jump on spider's back and ride around.Maybe Lunk even gather some venom for you!  No have to kill!"
1101,"The Traitor's Destruction : Everything we've done in the Ghostlands has been done with the goal of taking back what is rightfully ours.  The Scourge have maintained their chokehold on the region for far too long.The time has come for payback, <name>.  Thanks to your help and the help of our new allies, the Forsaken, vengeance will soon be ours.He who sought to steal the power of the Sunwell must die.  Go to Deatholme, the Scourge stronghold south of the Dead Scar.  Bring me Dar'Khan's head and your deeds will go down in history!"
1102,"Thirst Unending : If there is only one lesson you deign to remember from your time on Sunstrider Isle, let it be this - control your thirst for magic.  It is a thirst unending, <name> - what you absorb must be controlled and released via Arcane Torrent.  Failure is to become one of the Wretched... hopelessly addicted and insane.Seek out a mana wyrm and unleash your Arcane Torrent upon it.  Learn to master your power. When you have sufficiently released an Arcane Torrent, return to me."
1103,"Cities in Dust : Our armies clash across the battlefield. Crowley and his forces are losing ground and they do not yet know the fate of Lorna Crowley. We will meet with Crowley and his compatriots at mid field and I will present them with terms of their surrender. They will either accept or we will kill them all and leave their cities in dust.As my most trusted soldier, you are to stand by my side during the exchange. Tell me when you are prepared to leave."
1104,"The Green Hills of Stranglethorn : One page!  I only need one more page!Master Nesingwary's novel ran into a bit of an... accident <Barnil shoots an accusing glance over at Spanks>... and we misplaced some of the pages.I've been asking your fellow adventurers to look for the missing pages, and they've been quite helpful, but one page still eludes me.I'm sure you're awfully busy with other matters, but while you're out in the jungle, would you mind looking for it?"
1105,"The Shrine of Dath'Remar : Day after day I stand here, watching, waiting.  I've been accused of dwelling too much on our past, while my eyes look to the horizon.  But it is my firm belief that each visitor to this island should honor those who have sacrificed all so that they may continue to do so.Dath'Remar Sunstrider was our first king.  He led us here from Kalimdor through the Maelstrom.Seek out his shrine to the west and do not return to me until you have read the plaque upon it in his honor."
1106,"Escaped From Gilneas : As far as you know, a worgen rogue roaming in Tirisfal is a new development.  This is something that Executor Zygand would certainly be interested in."
1107,"A Man Named Godfrey : Lord Vincent Godfrey spent his life defending the kingdom of Gilneas. When the worgen curse ravaged this land, Godfrey was one of the first Gilneans to take up arms against the beasts. It is said that upon discovering that his king was afflicted by the curse, Godfrey took his own life. He would rather be dead than serve the very creatures that he had defended his home against.We are going to give him a second chance, <name>. Together we will battle southeast towards Tempest's Reach to collect his corpse."
1108,"Visions of the Past: The Slaughter of Biel'aran Ridge : Look, I know this is asking a lot during a time like this, but I need you to tear yourself away from this defeat for a moment.I will tend to these soldiers - you need to find the location of that battle with the Kvaldir General to the west that you told me about. You should be able to glimpse more of the Battlemaiden's experiences from there. I have a strong feeling that the key to defeating these naga will lie with that Battlemaiden.Please hurry - I will do everything I can to buy you time."
1109,"Goldtooth : I was playing near the Fargodeep Mine, and I think I dropped, er...I mean I saw, the old lady's necklace.  Don't ask me how it got there...it wasn't me!Well anyway, I saw this big, gold-toothed kobold pick up the necklace and run back to his den above the mine.  Go find that kobold and you'll find the necklace, I swear!"
1110,"The Captain's Chest : I used to sail a ship from here all the way to Ratchet, in Kalimdor.  I was a successful captain with a sterling reputation.Until...Those cursed sea giants ruined me!  They smashed my ship, killed my crew, and set me on a lifeboat to Booty Bay.  I will not rest until their corpses pepper the ocean floor!One of the giants, Gorlash, stole my captain's chest.  I hear Gorlash wanders the coast east of here.  Find him and get back my chest!  Do that, and you'll have earned a captain's gratitude."
1111,"The Jasperlode Mine : Thanks to you we know the Fargodeep Mine is infested with kobolds.  Now we need a scout to investigate the more distant Jasperlode Mine.Explore Jasperlode and confirm any kobold presence.  To reach the mine, travel east along the road until you reach the Tower of Azora.  From the tower, head north and you'll find the mine in the foothills."
1112,"Breaking Out is Hard to Do : The key to this cage is stored in a pouch over at the worg den, just north of our location. The problem is that the pouch is resting safely atop a tree stump amidst a sea of bloodthirsty man-killing worgs.You've got one shot to get that key without waking up any of those sleeping worgs. Head to the worg den and find a way into the center. Tread carefully and watch out for the Blackrock worg captain. Get the key and return to me.If you got a pet, I'd recommend telling it to stay back!"
1113,"Solanian's Belongings : With all the chaos happening here at the Sunspire, I haven't had a chance to collect my belongings I've left outside at various places on the isle.  I must maintain my vigil over the Sunwell here, so I'll ask you to collect them in my stead.I need my scrying orb, my scroll of Scourge magic, and my journal.  Use this satchel for some extra space, as my things are rather bulky.  Return them to me and I'll give you a little something - you know, for the effort; you can keep the satchel as well!"
1114,"Defending the Rift : The whispers of the elements are crowding my thoughts, <name>...The Throne of Tides is under siege!I cannot stand idly by while the naga threaten Neptulon's realm. We must find a way to join forces with him.Nazgrim will escort me to the depths where I can commune directly with Neptulon.I must ask you to take a more violent path. Keep the enemy forces distracted until I arrive safely at entrance to the Throne of Tides.May the spirits see us through, <name>."
1115,"The Fargodeep Mine : The mine in Northshire isn't the only one with problems!  I have reports that the Fargodeep Mine in Elwynn has also become a haven for Kobolds.Explore the mine and confirm these reports, then return to me.  The mine is almost due south of Goldshire, between the Stonefield and Maclure homesteads."
1116,"The Lost Pilot : My friend and fellow Siege Engine pilot, Mori Hildelve, is lost in the hills. We were looking for a rare ore that's needed for a high-grade blastpowder, and during our search he drove his engine up a steep hill and busted it!Still convinced that ore was in these mountains, Hildelve charged me to guard our engines while he continued on foot.It's been days, and I've heard some beastly growls north of Helm's Bed Lake, west of the tunnel. Mori's tough as nails, but I'm worried.Please, <name>. Find him."
1117,"Amani Encroachment : Ours are not the vast kingdoms of the humans and orcs.  All we have left of our lands in Azeroth lies mostly before your eyes, <name>.Until we can reach Outland, we must defend what little land we have at any cost.Our uncivilized neighbors to the southeast, the Amani trolls, certainly have a different opinion regarding the ownership of these lands.  Their daily raids are something we can't tolerate anymore.  Go to their settlements, Zeb'Watha and Tor'Watha, and teach them a lesson."
1118,"This Means WAR (Wild Arachnid Roundup) : The Highlord was generous enough to send some of his recruits to protect us here at the mill.  With your horsemanship skills, and their martial prowess, we can do away with this spider problem easily.Hop back on that mustang and scare those spiders again, but this time, scare them all the way up here to the mill.  These Hearthglen recruits can handle things from there."
1119,"Swift Action : We have everything we need to begin the attack.If your claims were correct, you would do well to make sure you cling tight to your mount as we make the run. Anyone who gets caught in the open water isn't likely to out-swim a naga.Kill as many as you can as we make the attack run and we'll rendezvous on the broken ledge of the southern terrace above once we've expended our explosives. Hopefully by that point there will be few enough that we can finish them off the old-fashioned way."
1120,"The Battle for Andorhal : Hurry, <name>... there isn't time to waste.The city of Andorhal is in the middle of a three-way war between the Forsaken, the Alliance, and the Scourge.  Lady Sylvanas has sent one of her best death knights to lead the charge for her cause, but I'm sure he can use all the help he can get.  With Arthas dead, now is the perfect time for the Forsaken to take Andorhal.Speak with the bat handler, Timothy Cunningham, when you are ready, and he will put you on the first flight out there."
1121,"Journey To The Sunwell : Take Quel'Delar to the Sunwell as quickly as possible, <name>. Trust in Uther's words when he says that you will not always be able to control the blade while it is subject to the evil of the Lich King's influence. You must travel to the Isle of Quel'Danas, and there, seek entry to the Sunwell itself, where you can cleanse the sword.The guardians of the Sunwell will not simply allow you to walk in, so you must find Halduron Brightwing, who will be inspecting the guards there."
1122,"The Legend of Stalvan : I'm here because I received a letter from my brother Stalvan, who I haven't seen in years. On arriving here, I was told he was dead...The entire town refuses to offer any further explanation. Any mention of his name is met with terror and suspicion. As if I didn't have enough of that myself!I'm afraid of what will happen if my frustration and anger grows any further. I beg you, help me get to the bottom of this. Implore Clerk Daltry for any information he may have on my brother."
1123,"A Shiny Reward : There is a stash of loot located in the statue on Janeiro's Point just northwest of Booty Bay in Stranglethorn Vale.Head to the statue and claim your prize, <class>."
1124,"The Battle of Darrowshire : Now, <name>, you will take part in battle of Darrowshire, and you will save Joseph Redpath.Place this relic bundle in the Darrowshire town square, and the spirits of Darrowshire will rise.  Join their battle and assure that these two things come to pass: Davil must survive beyond the death of Horgus, and Redpath must survive to be corrupted, then defeated.After defeating the corrupted Redpath, his spirit will be saved.  Speak with him, then return to his daughter Pamela."
1125,"If The Key Fits : The wyrms have already taken the battle to the sky above Grim Batol. It's up to us to move our men in by ground and secure the gates.I want you to know what is at stake here, <class>. Grim Batol is the source of Twilight's Hammer reinforcements to all of the highlands. If we do not cut them off here, we will not win the battles ahead.I'm sending a squad from Highbank with you. Get to the gate to the southeast and get it open. Your lieutenant should have any further instructions you'll need from there."
1126,"They Have Allies, But So Do We : The night elves made good on their promise.  They've brought ships and are ready to offer us sanctuary in their lands.Unfortunately, the Forsaken's allies have arrived as well.The orcs are advancing upon us while the Horde gunship prevents the transport ships from taking our people to safety.The druids are holding the enemy back, but won't last long.  Fortunately, the elven ships were carrying siege weapons.  Take one of the glaive throwers and meet the enemy head on."
1127,"Onward, to Light's Hope Chapel : Now that the boys are back, we can head out.  You headed east?Please, join us!  I insist!  Yesterday, we were in the Menders' Stead, and I was telling Tarenar, ""We have two paladins and a shopkeeper, but you know what we really need?  A <class>!""Don't look at me that way!  I'm serious!  Come on, hop in the cart."
1128,"Protect the Home Front : The Legion hasn't just invaded this city. Their evil is spreading across Azeroth, threatening the far corners of our world.We must seek them out and stop them, everywhere their darkness touches.We've dispatched scouts around the world to watch for Legion activity. As invasions arise, we'll mark the locations on your map.Make them suffer, <name>!"
1129,"The Dwarven Spy : Listen, <name>.  This is a very delicate situation; even though we've identified the spy, we cannot kill him out in the open.  We cannot try to capture him either as the risk of him escaping is too great.I want you to go find Prospector Anvilward at the North Sanctum and kill him.  Do this in a quiet manner, we don't want word to spread that we allowed a spy into our city.Bring me his head as proof.  Ironforge will learn not to meddle with the sin'dorei."
1130,"Powering our Defenses : Ancient runestones once powered a protective barrier across the Eversong border.  Many were destroyed during Arthas' attack; others were stolen.Of the three that remain, only this one has retained its powers.  The runestone to the east might be salvageable, though.Take this crystal and instill its energy on the Eastern Runestone.  The process should take but a minute.  Beware though, nearby Scourge will be drawn to it and will seek to destroy it.  Do not let them!"
1131,"Visions of the Past: Rise from the Deep : What you told me of the naga before has been plaguing my mind. Who are these allies they're summoning? Do they really think they can defeat the Tidehunter?Escaping this cave brings a degree of relief, but our purpose here remains. I'm hoping you will be willing to seek answers from the Battlemaiden one last time.There's only one place that I can think of where they would have taken the artifact - the temple atop the ruins. It's sure to be well guarded. Proceed carefully."
1132,"Call of Booty : You feel like you've done just about enough damage, and you know the Bloodsail's battle plans.  You've done everything that Baron Revilgaz has asked of you.It's time to hang up the pirate hat and return to Booty Bay.  The battle looms near."
1133,
1134,Unplug L'ghorek : L'ghorek is the ancient that rests upon the shelf across from us. It is being controlled and its life energies slowly consumed by something immense beneath us.There is a cave known as the Undershell down below L'ghorek. In that cave are three powerful ogre magi that are maintaining a ritual connecting the thing below with the ancient. You must kill these three to disconnect L'ghorek.
1135,Explorers' League Document (6 of 6) : The document bears the Explorers' League crest and contains detailed assessments of the various threats present within Loch Modan. Sooty smudges lead you to believe it was likely stolen by the Dark Iron spies in the area.You recall mention of missing documents at the Explorers' League building in Thelsamar.
1136,"Murder Was The Case That They Gave Me : Here's the deal, kid, we've got a full-blown murder on our hands. Double homicide... Single horse... icide.Worse yet, we're in Westfall. I could throw a rock behind me and hit a dozen hobos with motive enough to want to wipe these people (and horse) out.Now I don't know who did this and I sure don't appreciate having to come to this dump to investigate the deaths of a couple of squatters, but I'll be damned if I don't find the perp. You want to help? Go talk to some bums. The hobo... knows."
1137,"Captain Sanders' Hidden Treasure : Sure enough, deep within the Old Jug there is another clue to Sanders' treasure.  The ink has run in some places and the paper smells like whiskey but you can make out some of the text:  Now that ye found me ol' whiskey jug, you're almost to the treasure!  Just face West from the bottle and walk down to the shore.  Once ye get to the water, keep going!  Swim straight west till you find the island with me treasure chest!"
1138,"Unexpected Results : Something's wrong, <name>.  I sense the presence of Scourge.  Be ready to fight them!"

1140,Panther Mastery : You've almost proven yourself to be a master hunter of panthers.  Yet there is one panther which has eluded your grasp.Songs are sung about a mighty panther by the name of Bhag'thera.  You will see if you can use your skills to kill the great beast.Bringing the Fang of Bhag'thera to Erlgadin should be proof enough that you are a master panther hunter.
1141,
1142,"Full Circle : We've located the beast that destroyed our ships. It makes its lair in Tenebrous Cavern, a giant underwater cave bordering the Abyssal Breach.This time we're ready. The goblins have been proving their worth by making a vicious machine for us back at Bilgewater Harbor, and it's packing firepower that'll make that fiend wet itself.When the Verne pulls up to dock beside the ship, make your way on board and find a way to make yourself useful. We'll be right behind you."
1143,"The Demon Chain : Narkrall revealed to me the secret of his influence over the drakes in this area. I thought the Demon Chain was a myth, but he's had it all along.And now the fool is about to lose it!His life is meaningless to me but the Dragonmaw can't afford to lose that artifact. Follow him north, up to Thundermar. The city will be in chaos, so you may be able to land undetected. Return to me with the Demon Chain, even if you have to remove it from Narkrall's corpse.Find that artifact, <name>!"
1144,"In With a Bang : Our trade frigate's still all the way out there on the water, swarming with Gilblins! AHH!Sorry about that. But really! We need a way to get you out there and get back our stuff. There's quality goods left on that ship! QUALITY! LIKE MY MIDDLE NAME!Lucky for you, I have an idea! Head right outside the camp and check along the north wall... my son Jerry'll get you over there with our cannon! If he's been practicing, that is!"

NO MERCY!With the P.O.W.s freed you're clear to plant the seaforium. Carefully make your way into each of the structures out there and plant a charge.Plant a seaforium charge at the Blackrock munitions hut and the Blackrock tower. Once you're done meet up with me and the rest of Bravo Company at Shalewind Canyon, east of Render's Valley."
1146,"Slaves to No One : I was one of the few that escaped, <name>.  When the Forsaken took over our town and our mine, they treated us with utmost cruelty.Those of us who were weak and could not endure hard labor were worked to death by the abomination known as Brothogg.My wife was among his victims, <class>, and I swore that one day her death would be avenged.  I am too frail now, but you can deliver justice... for my wife... for Gilneas!"

Our guards are keeping them at bay, for now.The Stormwind Harbor Guards are seeking seasoned adventurers for help in removing the trolls from the harbor.  Report to Commander Sharp at Stormwind Harbor."
1148,"Saving Yenniku : I have reshaped the Mind's Eye into a Soul Gem.  Its purpose is twofold: you must use it to stun Yenniku, and once stunned place it upon his head to entrap his soul.My suspicions that I spoke of earlier were correct: the spirits tell me that Yenniku dwells not with Zanzil the Outcast, but within the Ruins of Zul'Mamwe, to the southwest.  Once you have freed Yenniku's spirit, return to Nimboya at Grom'gol."

Morbent Fel is just ahead!>"

But, wellWhen I was putting the finishing touches on it in my secret cavern lab, my other creations became, er, jealous.

Please, journey into the cave and retrieve it for me!"
1152,"Checking on the Boys : I'm sure you've seen just how bad the damage to the Loch is by now. The damage spreads further than that, I'm afraid; all that water had to go somewhere, and it went down into the Wetlands.There's a lot of fine dwarves down there trying to help out, and they need supplies. That's why I sent two of my mountaineers ahead with a cask of ale along the path into the Wetlands.I haven't heard back from them since they set off down the road to Dun Algaz. Would you mind checking up on them?"

A true warden keeps his gaze INWARD, always focused on protecting his quarry.""Perhaps this is a riddle of some sort?"

1159,"Dropping the Hammer : Thanks to you and Iain, we've got enough riders together that we can take the fight back to the Twilight.We're trained to fight while ridin', but a second rider to handle the Stormhammer tends to be more efficient. I thought you might enjoy the honor.Pick your gryphon and join the fight. Best be quick about it though - we're aimin' to clear every last one of those Twilight off of those floatin' rocks before the hour's out."
1160,"Setting An Example : The High-Shaman are in the buildings nearby, chanting and taunting, but not daring to approach me. These Kvaldir find their courage and strength only in the mist.

I know that An'daroth can't provide enough power for that, but An'owyn, directly to the south, most definitely can!From the plans I now have a basic knowledge of how these moon crystals work; enough to shut them down. They're keyed so that they can be turned off. You must go to An'owyn, retrieve the controlling orb from one of the night elves and then use it on the moon crystal to stop them from enacting their plan!Hurry, <class>!"
1164,Further Conversions : My plan to replace the damaged crystals on the erratic sentries has been a success.

It's bad enough that the Wretched have stolen what little magical goods I had, but the murlocs took the rest! What has this land come to?Could you retrieve my cargo? I can't expect that you'd be able to get all of it back, but I'll be grateful for any of it at this point.

1229,"Neither Human Nor Beast : It is time, <name>.  This... alchemy that has kept the beast inside you at bay will not last for long.The first cursed worgen were night elf druids like our new allies.  They, however, abandoned the balance that the rest of their kind embraced and allowed the beast to take over their minds.It is only fitting that their brethren be the ones that deliver us from the Curse.  Go, <class>.  Drink from the waters of Tal'doren and make peace with yourself."
1230,"Thorium Point: The Seat of the Brotherhood : Did... did you see that?  This is the missing piece we've been looking for!  We have to take this information back to someone at Thorium Point.The Dark Irons have been known to consort with the firelord in the past, but never before have they brought their kind this far out into Searing Gorge.Thorium Point is west and north of here.  You will find it nestled in the cliffs that overlook Pyrox Flats.  Take this information straight to Overseer Oilfist."
1231,"Just a Drop in the Bucket : Now, mix a tiny amount of rot into the water, and mix thoroughly.  There, that's it.  This solution will still be very powerful, and we only need a little bit of it.On the lake's southeastern border, you will find a plague cauldron with several cultists nearby.  Put on your cultist disguise, then approach the cauldron and put in ONE DROP of the solution you made.  No more, or you may risk your very life!"
1232,"Duty Calls : Hear me, <race>.Duty requires that you return to Azeroth. Every able person is to report to the Sunwell Plateau immediately.I'm afraid I have no more information to share, except this:You'll be joining forces with the Aldor for this mission. Speak with a draenei by the name of Larethor when you arrive.Apparently, the situation calls for us to set our differences aside and join forces.Prepare yourself, friend. This sounds serious."
1233,"The Fate of Kurzen : Hello, <class>.We are soldiers of Stormwind, and rebels from Kurzen's Compound, a large outpost that you'll find just to the southeast of here.  We were under the command of Colonel Kurzen, until he and those close to him started to descend into madness...We rebelled, set up camp here, and stood against Kurzen.  Now, my sources are telling me Kurzen has disappeared.  I trust my source, but it would help to hear from a third party.  Please, head into the compound and find some documentation of his fate."
1234,"Kliklak's Craw : You are pleasantly surprised to find that after being mangled and masticated by a sea crab, this map is still quite legible.It clearly indicates that a footlocker was buried in the Kelp'thar Forest behind a gigantic mollusk.A well-drawn sketch on the back of the map shows that the owner, along with his key, was eaten by an overgrown crustacean named Kliklak."
1235,"A Vision of the Past : This incense will put your body and mind in a deep meditative state. Once the trance begins you will be pulled into the spirit world. Do not fight the trance once it has begun, <name>. Allow the spirits to show you what they know.You must leave now. Go to the Deadmines, a place which I am told holds great significance in the history of Westfall. Once inside, use the incense.You may enter the Deadmines through the old farmhouse south of here. Follow the homeless. Return to Gryan with your discovery."
1236,"Situation at Sunsail Anchorage : Sunsail Anchorage has been overrun by Wretched scum.  As soon as we manage to get reinforcements to the area we'll show those thugs who's boss, <name>.In the meantime you can help by showing them a bit of discipline.  Go in there and show them we are not to be trifled with.  You will find Sunsail Anchorage just to the west of Fairbreeze Village."
1237,"Stones of Binding : Four Stones of Binding are scattered throughout Arathi.  These stones keep me pinned beneath the earth.To unlock them you must unlock the strongest: the Stone of Inner Binding.  And to do that, you must gather keys from the other three.These stones are watched by guardians, but if you are clever, or lucky, you may find ways to banish them."
1238,"The Lady's Necklace : The necklace shimmers, a remarkable piece of jewelry that doesn't seem to succumb to the gloom that permeates the Ghostlands. Given the inscription, and where you found it, it must be the lost property of Lady Sylvanas Windrunner herself!Perhaps it would be best to first take it to High Executor Mavren at Tranquillien? He seems to be the highest ranking Forsaken in the area and is sure to know what to do with it."
1239,"And Last But Not Least... Danforth : Danforth's being tortured on the other side of the cave. There's no telling what state he's in by now! We need to get over there and save him!Overlord Barbarius has the key to the lever holding Danforth up. We work together as a team and we can kill that bastard, Barbarius. Once Barbarius is dead, we use his key to get Danforth down and get out of here!Ready?"
1240,"Stormpike's Delivery : The Stormpikes are a respected dwarven clan, and are well known for their fine and discerning tastes.  So it's no wonder that Gringer Stormpike, a Mountaineer of Ironforge, commissioned me to craft him a weapon.The weapon is finished, but... Mountaineer Stormpike is far away, in distant Loch Modan.  If you plan on traveling to the north, can you deliver this package to him?My last message from Mountaineer Stormpike said he's stationed at the northern guard tower in Loch Modan."
1241,"Axis of Awful : Alright, now just shut yer gob and lemme talk, 'cause here's the plan.Those gnolls and murlocs are liable to be meetin' out there somewhere. So you take this clever plant disguise of mine, and you wear it and look like a plant. Then you sneak up on 'em, and you throw this scent pheromone you gathered on the mosshide standin' with the murlocs.Then the murlocs'll flip their spit, and the mosshides will think twice about trying to work with such crazy lil' buggers!"
1242,"The Endless Flow : Araj the Summoner is bolstering the Scourge defenses with simple skeletons... an army of weaklings that will overwhelm you before it overpowers you.  He has assembled animi within Andorhal's northern towers that spew these skeletons out at an alarming rate.  But I've got the solution!<Lang passes you a handful of grenades.>Their function is simple.  Throwing these grenades at a bone animus... or, for that matter, a mob of skeletons... will reduce them to splinters."
1243,"The Hungry Ettin : Listen, <name>.  We're not going to make it very far without transportation, are we?If we just hightail it out of here, the forsaken will catch up to us in no time at all.Rounding up some horses from the stable grounds southeast of here would normally be a breeze, but there's one snag.That last quake must've spooked Koroth, the ettin, down from the mountains.  If we don't get our horses soon, I fear that he will."
1244,"Welcome to Highbank! : Welcome to the highlands, soldier. You're here just in time.Horde troops just launched an assault from the air. Step up and do something about it. Clear them out!"
1245,"Transdimensional Warfare: Chapter III : <Sylvanas speaks directly through you.>You must find the being responsible for keeping this dimensional pocket active. Likely that fool, Ataeric... Search the compound for him. Should you find him, do what you must to stop him from channeling his magic. He is undoubtedly protected by a powerful arcane shield, and will send minions of arcane energy after you.  Defeat the minions while they are near him to unleash their energies.  No mage can handle that much power!"
1246,"Serpents and Poison : Da warning helped, <name>.We gathered more Headhunters to help defend.  But Headhunters... Dey not used to hunting heads on serpents.  So we soon be overwhelmed.  Dese serpents, dey seem to come from everywhere.  An' it probably only gonna get worse.Help us and kill da serpents and have Bwemba use her mojo to cure da ones dat are sick from poison."
1247,"Honor and Strength : My name is Vex'tul, and I have watched you fight, <race>.  You are strong.You killed my master, Zaeldarr, but this does not bother me.  I value strength over any loyalty that I held for him.  I value strength over anything else.Prove to me one final time your strength, <race>.  Do so, and I will lend you MY strength for whatever purpose you may desire."
1248,Tainted Arcane Sliver : You've found an odd sliver of crystallized mana on the corpse of the tainted arcane wraith.  The sliver is different than others you may have seen in that it is as dark and sinister-looking as the wraith you looted it from.  Just holding it gives you a sense of unnatural foreboding.Arcanist Helion at the gazebo of the Sunspire on Sunstrider Isle just might be someone who would have a use for the sliver.
1249,"Far from the Nest : Look... I know you have no reason to be fond of me, just as I'm not terribly fond of you, but I need any help I can get.Our eggs are being stolen by these Twilight invaders. I have no doubt that they want to take them back to Grim Batol to experiment on and pervert. I will NOT let that happen.If you truly do want to help us, stop them! Recover the eggs. Bring them back to me."
1250,Skullcrusher the Mountain : It was a trap! Cho'gall lured you in with the Hammer of Twilight so that his gronn could finish you off.Survive and slay Skullcrusher the Mountain!
1251,"Warchief's Command: Blasted Lands! : All able bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Okrilla at Dreadmaul Hold.Okrilla, commander of the Horde forces at Dreadmaul Hold, requires your help to secure the outpost against rebellious ogres and the forces of the Alliance.Travel to Dreadmaul Hold by taking the road south from the Swamp of Sorrows.Destiny calls!"
1252,"Okrilla and the Blasted Lands : I have one final dispatch to deliver to you, <name>.  It comes from Dreadmaul Hold, to the south, in the Blasted Lands.Warmatron Okrilla is waging battle against the Alliance forces of Nethergarde Keep, and she needs the assistance of a stout <class>.  You immediately sprung to mind.Travel south into the Blasted Lands, then head west.  Good luck, <name>."
1253,"First Blood : Be prepared, <name>. You will cast the first blood upon this land for us.The Syndicate, as they call themselves, are cowardly humans who betray even their own kind. Their isolation will make them easy prey.Travel north, slay any Syndicate members you find, and claim Northfold Manor in the name of the Forsaken. Bring me the Bloodstone Amulets they wear as proof of your conquest."
1254,"Unbinding : Look, if there's one thing I know, it's elementals. I've been able to really gain an appreciation for how they feel. Let me tell you, they don't appreciate being enslaved one bit!So, what I'm saying here is that if you were to free the enslaved elementals, I'm sure that not only would they show their gratitude, they'd also likely turn on their masters.Sounds like a win-win to me, <name>."
1255,"Attack of the Iron Horde : We received reports of the Dark Portal turning red right before the attack. They call themselves the Iron Horde.Their army is extremely well equipped, and their numbers appear to be unending.They have already taken Okril'lon Hold and Nethergarde Keep. Our troops on the frontlines could use your help, <class>."
1256,"Yetimus the Yeti Lord : For years the mountain yeti of this region have been allowed free reign. Our complacency in dealing with the yeti menace has resulted in an aberration! Yetimus, lord of all yetis, has grown to a size and strength that our guard simply cannot handle. We fear that should his appetite lead him near Tarren Mill he would devour us all.Gather a party of suitable adventurers and dispatch the beast. He roams the countryside to the west.Bring me one of his horns and I will reward you handsomely."
1257,"WANTED: The Dark Iron Spy : A dark iron spy has infiltrated the town, stolen documents from the Explorers' League establishment, and is now in hiding somewhere nearby. He was last sighted near the top of the hill to the south of town.A sizable reward awaits anyone who can bring this spy to justice. Dead or alive - dead preferred."
1258,"Joining the Alliance : We have a duty, <name>.It is our responsibility to spread the Tushui philosophy beyond the edges of the Wandering Isle... and there is no better place to start doing that than here: Stormwind City, heart of the Alliance.Let's find out who their leader is. We need allies."
1259,"Northfold Manor : We are fighting a war for Stromgarde, and we are losing.  The ogres, the Syndicate and we have divided our once great city, and each faction battles the other into a bloody stalemate.But our forces dwindle while our enemy grows.Though Southshore has fallen, we must not let any further ground be yielded to our enemies.Go to the Syndicate base in Northfold Manor and slay them. We must reclaim the land for ourselves before the Horde has a chance to creep further."
1260,"Just Hatched : While looking through this soldier's possessions, you look down to see a newborn raptor hatchling looking back up at you.  Was it following this Kurzen militiaman the whole time?You can see it studying you, learning your features and following your movements.The lashtail hatchling has formed a bond with you.Perhaps someone back at the Rebel Camp will know what to do with a raptor hatchling."
1261,"Morgan Ladimore : <He searches through the shelves and comes up with a leatherbound book.>If you would like to know more, you might ask Althea, she's been the one to handle the... trouble... with him of late."
1262,"Recruitment : We've been shipping in dead bodies from Silverpine, Hillsbrad... hell, anywhere we can get them from.  We can't, however, afford to ignore the bodies which are sitting right on our front doorstep.The last vestiges of the Scarlet Crusade roam here in Tirisfal Glades.  While we've managed to push them from Deathknell, several of their bodies litter the buildings to the north and the east.Go find them... and bring that Darnell fellow with you.  He looks strong enough to carry a few corpses."
1263,"""I TAKE Candle!"" : Back before those damned kobolds gave me a permanent limp I used to be William Pestle's number one candle supplier. Hell, I even came up with the line ""I TAKE CANDLE!"" Yea, that was me. Kobold would say ""You no take candle!"" and I'd just respond ""I TAKE CANDLE!"" and then bash their brains in!<Jimb drifts off for a second.>Good times... The best times.Now? Can't even use the bathroom without assistance. You want to help me? Kill me some kobolds. You'll find a good load of 'em in the nearby mine."
1264,"Reclaiming the Ramparts : With the ley lines protected we must move to secure the tower's perimeter.Around the tower are several locations where corruption continues to run rampant. Seek out these locations and secure them with these wards.With the progress we've made so far, bolstering our defenses should keep the remaining Legion's forces at bay just long enough for us to discover who's behind their efforts."
1265,"Learning the Ropes : Ah, it's good to be back in Northridge!  I've got my mill, my beautiful wife, a bouncing baby boy... I've even put in my hat with the Argent Crusade.  We'll be supplying Tirion's forces with lumber.My lumberjacks were being exceptionally productive, too... up until the point when the spiders came.  Now they refuse to go any deeper in the woods.Maybe you can help me out.  Hop on one of my horses and use it to frighten those spiders.  Maybe we can avoid bloodshed and just scare them away."
1266,"The Sanctum of the Sun : You've proven your loyalty to Tranquillien and have helped us defend it against the threat of the Scourge.  Some of our most powerful magisters have come from Silvermoon to help us take the fight to the enemy's doorstep.They've rebuilt the arcane sanctum to the south and have driven the Scourge away from the surrounding area.  They plan to launch an offensive into Deatholme, Dar'Khan's stronghold.  You would do well to join them, <name>.  I'm sure they can make use of a seasoned <class> like yourself."
1267,"Neptool's Revenge : No number of naga deaths will bring back the Rockpool tribe, but any amount of revenge will help the spirits of my people rest more easily.Many of the more powerful Bloodwash have set up a fortress in the caverns to the northwest.  Slay them, in the name of the Rockpool.  The remaining Bloodwash have erected gladiatorial pools and Azsh'ir altars on our beach, where they pit my people against one another and worship their false god.  Slay them, in the name of the Tidehunter."
1268,"Discretion is Key : We must destroy all of the evidence, <name>! Did I say evidence? I meant crazed undead! Anyway, discretion is key. We must not let the rampaging undead make it out of the Sludge Fields and no one outside of this institution must know about what happened here!Directly southeast of here in what used to be the old mushroom farm you'll find a reanimated fiend known as Citizen Wilkes and his cohort, Clerk Horrace Whitesteed. They have been causing huge problems for my guards. Find them and kill them!"
1269,"Onward to Thelsamar : You've helped us quite a bit here. If you're leaving, I'd ask you to take this status report up to Thelsamar.Follow the road just north, and you can't miss it. Mountaineer Kadrell will want the report."
1270,"Look at the Size of It! : Well, well, well... Isn't this a surprise. The Chambermaid had a gigantic ornate pillow and now it's yours. Evonice Sootsmoker will definitely want to get her grubby little hands all over this item. Take it to her and see if she'll offer you any goodies for your trouble."
1271,"Hot On the Trail: Murlocs : As pointless as I think that this is going to be, we need to investigate all of our leads.I need you to head out to the Longshore, west of here, on the coast, and shake up some murlocs. Try to find a clue or some info that can help shed some light on the murders.Return to me if you get lucky, rookie."
1272,"Captain Kelisendra's Lost Rutters : Interesting... what you have found here is a water-proofed, leather tube containing a number of sheets of parchment. By the markings upon them, the pages are clearly navigation rutters, and each bears the signature of one Captain Kelisendra.You've heard of a small, defended camp just east of the nearby Sunsail Anchorage. Maybe the captain is there?"
1273,"Into the Flames : This is the last time you will see me, <name>.  I am leaving the caravan.If you want to continue fighting by my side, hang on to Thresh'jin's body.  I can wait for a while longer.  When you are ready to say goodbye, throw the body into the bonfire atop Zul'Mashar's ziggurat.Thank you for your companionship, <name>.  You were strong."
1274,"Silver Tide Hollow : Most of the other Earthen Ring that escaped the massacre on the boats have taken shelter in a cave a short swim down from the ridge. It's tucked midway up a huge rock formation, west of Nespirah, the gigantic shell on the horizon.  I need you to make sure they're okay. There's no telling how many naga might have attacked them as well.I'm going to hunt down that Fathom-Lord. I'll send word if I find the rock he's hiding under."
1275,"Vengeful Heart : These are the naga that took our people. I only need one to interrogate, kill the rest.Show no mercy, <class>, for they would surely show us none."
1276,"Devout Assembly : Ah, Battlemaiden. You carry with you the word and the will of our Lady. I might ask a favor of you...I need Fathom-Caller Azrajar and my Tide Priestesses to return so that we can begin the ritual. Can you carry my will to them as such? You should find them spread upon the temple terrace. Azrajar will be at the stairs to the north."
1277,"The Westfall Brigade : We were once known as the People's Militia. These days, though, we fight under the banner of Stormwind, with the full support of King Anduin Wrynn. Our goals here in Westfall are many: to clean up the mess left behind by the Defias, to expand the reach of the Alliance and to maintain order. So far we are failing on all fronts.Times are worse now than when the Defias ran amok. Now with the indigenous gnolls of the region up in arms, we find ourselves backed into a corner. Help us, <name>!"
1278,"Lost in the Darkness : Some would say that we are lucky to be alive. Those people would be idiots. At least had we died we would not have had to face the Warchief's wrath. Alas, what's done is done! Now we must attempt to regain our lost honor.The third ship in our fleet sank off the coast of the Skittering Dark, northwest of here. Those that made it to shore quickly found themselves swarmed by the giant spiders of the area and encased in webbing.If there are survivors we must free them! Go, <name>! To the Skittering Dark!"
1279,"Scrapped Golems : We keep golems here, as guards.  The dwarves to our north also keep golems, but I'm not sure why.Mainly just for killin', I suppose.We could use some spare parts for our own golems, so here's what yer gonna do: kill theirs, then look for any parts that might've fallen on the ground.  Salvage what ye can.  Ye probably won't be able to salvage everything, so choose carefully."
1280,"Crisis at the Sunwell : By the naaru, I thank you, <race>, for your efforts.Our work is far from finished, however, and I must request that you undertake a critical mission - one as important as any I've issued.Our forces are spread thinly. To compound the strain, we've had to dispatch a contingent to Azeroth to investigate developments at the Sunwell Plateau.You are needed there, <name>. Report to Larethor. Tell him that I wish we could spare more men."
1281,"Abuse of Power : <name>?  Eitrigg here.It sounds like you have earned Thorg'izog's trust, and he's assigned you to discipline duty.  This is fortunate.We need you to take out his sergeants.  You'll find them on wolfback, outside of the Blackrock Stronghold in the Fields of Honor.  Use that cudgel on them, several times, until they die.  You'll have to act fast, because if they realize you're not one of them, they can unmask you.  Strike quickly and ferociously, <name>."
1282,"Headhunting : We must find if Yenniku is dead.Slay the Bloodscalps of Zuuldaia and take from them their shrunken heads.  You must gather many, many heads, and I will inspect them to make sure Yenniku's head is not among them.And if Yenniku was killed by the Bloodscalps, then may a 600-year curse fall on the spirit of their chief, Gan'zulah!Go, <name>.  You will find the heads at the ruins of Zuuldaia, along the coast to the north."
1283,"The Altar of Naias : The salt you brought was sufficient to activate the bracers' innate enchantments.  I have taken these enchantments and combined them into a summoning token... a gift, if you will.Return to the Isle of Naias, and place the gift on Naias' altar.  Call me again once you have Naias' heart."
1284,"Rhea Revealed : As I hinted earlier, I am no ordinary goblin.  You may have already guessed my true identity.Allow me to show you my true form.  As you have proven yourself trustworthy, I will also share with you the details of my plan."
1285,"Traveling Companions : While we're waiting here at this tower, we might as well see if anybody else is headed to Light's Hope Chapel.  The more, the merrier, I say!Ask around to see if anybody wants to join us on our trip.  I'm sure you can find somebody who's headed to Light's Hope."
1286,"Snapjaws, Lad! : I've got plans to brew up somethin' special for those pesky trolls. Aye, I said for them... a brew they won't ever forget! A brew that'll have them pickin' their tusks out of the hillsides!I've got a few ingredients steepin' already, but I could use a hand gatherin' more. At the bottom of the Overlook Cliffs to the east, near the shore, is a whole mess o' snapjaws. I need fresh, whole gizzards from them for my blastbrew."
1287,"Of Utmost Importance : When Garrosh's zeppelin went down, so did the induction samophlange that you recovered for us in Azshara. The Alliance have it somewhere in that keep, and Krazz wants it back.The basement of the keep would be my best guess, so start there. When you get your hands on it, bring it back to me near the eastern tower."
1288,"Blackfin's Booty : <A torn page precedes the latest entry, which reads:>Our self-proclaimed king will stop at nothing to acquire my family fortune. He has threatened and harassed me to no end.I can't take it anymore!I've buried the treasure and fed the map to Blackfin.That should keep my cousin's grubby little mitts off of our precious heirlooms!"
1289,"The Eye of Paleth : Opening the chest reveals a blackened orb, pulsing with an eerie light. This must be the foul Eye of Paleth that damned these sailors' souls.Such corruption should be purged. Perhaps a priest in Menethil Harbor could help you."
1290,"Araj the Summoner : With the animus destroyed, the next logical step is to take out Araj himself, and to take a shard of his phylactery.  You've probably already seen him, lurking at the fountain in the center of town.Take my grenades with you.  They won't do anything to Araj, but if he decides to summon any of those skeletons, you can use them to blow them away.  Again."
1291,"Rune Ruination : Examining the Twilight Rune of Earth, you can almost feel its power extending further into the Elementium Depths.It's probably connected to other runes. Initiate Goldmine thinks that you should destroy all of them."
1292,"Elmore's Task : There's a dwarven weaponsmith in Stormwind, Grimand Elmore, who sent word that he needs help with a delivery.  I believe he wants a package sent to his homeland in the north.You have a sturdy pair on you!  So if you're interested in some legwork then speak with Grimand.  We could use you down here, but we must also keep our ties strong with the dwarves.You can find Grimand Elmore at the weapon shop in the Dwarven District of Stormwind, in the northeast section of town."
1293,"The Public Servant : As a member of the Senate and the Explorers' League, I've taken it upon myself to investigate conditions at the quarry. The troggs have run wild!They've made a mess of the Gol'Bolar quarry. As we dug deep into the earth, they poured out, destroying our equipment and trapping many of the miners below ground.We have to get them out of there. I've had mages working overtime to enchant these runes of return. If you can get them to the trapped miners, they can return to the surface in safety."
1294,"Akiris by the Bundle : The naga explorers to our west carry a valuable ocean reed - Akiris reeds.  Traders use them to make medicines and poultices, and craftsmen use them to line armor or even wrap cigars!In the evenings, when digging's done, father's been teaching me how to use them... but unfortunately, we ran out.  Would you mind getting us some more?"
1295,"Scourge First... Horde Later : Darkmaster Gandling of the Cult of the Damned leads the Scourge offensive here in Andorhal.  My old counterpart, Koltira, leads the Forsaken forces.  If we're to win Andorhal, we'll have to defeat both, but we will certainly fail if we take on both at once.I know Koltira well enough to know that he will focus on the Scourge first.  We will do the same.Take out the weaker, desiccated Scourge to reduce their numbers.  The Forsaken will have to wait to taste our wrath."
1296,"Spinal Dust : The dark energy that flows through the bodies of reanimated skeletons tends to accumulate primarily in their spine.  I've discovered a method of instilling this energy into a potion that boosts our magical abilities against the undead.Bring me some spinal dust and I'll be glad to provide you with a sample.  You'll find an ample number of skeletons wandering the Dead Scar, west of here."
1297,"Not Fireflies, Flameflies : Most of my fellow residents here at Flame Crest seem to have left at some point.  I guess the Burning Steppes weren't INTERESTING enough for them.Not me, though.  I'm always finding new reasons to not leave, and the latest happens to be the flameflies that have been appearing lately.They appear near lava during the day.  By night, you'll find them almost anywhere.If you wouldn't mind collecting some, I might be able to make it worth your while."
1298,"Rebels Without a Clue : Several years ago, Stormwind's Captain Kurzen brought a brigade into Stranglethorn Vale on a mission whose details are still murky.  Kurzen swiftly descended into madness, as did his men... except for a few rebels who made it their mission to undo the evils that Kurzen had wrought.As I said, that was years ago.  I'm now hearing rumors that Kurzen is dead, but those rebels still persist at their rebellion.  If you wish to investigate, you'll find them at a camp on Stranglethorn's northern border."
1299,"The Good Stuff : I've got a little proposition for you, if you're interested.Those Dark Irons were here before Durdin and his crew arrived.  That means that, once these titan ruins opened up, the dark irons were the first ones in there, lootin' all the good stuff.  I'll bet they've still got those treasures locked up inside Angor Fortress, northwest of here.You've more than proven your ability to wallop a dwarf.  Head on into that fortress and wallop your way to titan treasure.I'd go with, but I'm drunk."
1300,"Annihilate the Worgen : These worgen must be dealt with, and quickly.  Our first priority is to eliminate any which may have infiltrated Brill.I want you to be on the lookout for any suspicious activity here in Brill, <name>.  We know that these worgen can hide in the shadows, so look for any signs you can find... footsteps, kicked-up rocks... anything."
1301,"Holding the Lines : Karazhan sits upon a confluence of ley lines. It's why this location was chosen for the tower in the first place... a fact that has not escaped the Legion's notice.If the demons are tapping into these lines of power, they must need their energy for something particularly menacing. You must cut off their access to the ley lines if we're to have a chance of retaking the tower, <name>."
1302,"Don't Stop Now.... : Now that we have an anvil, I can really get to work.No matter how many supplies we receive, I'll always be able to put the Darkspine Iron Ore to good use. We'll need a constant supply of weapons and armor if we're to be successful here.There are a group of naga on the coast to the east of here. They're collecting ore and placing it in chests for shipment to the Legion. Relieving them of their ore will help our efforts in more ways than one...."
1303,"Ghouls Hate My Grains : You're a pro at this, <name>! A regular junior botanist! Listen, I've got a new seed to try called the rocknut. Use it to block the undead. Just drop it down and they'll stop dead in their tracks. Undead are so stupid!Let's give it a try!"
1304,Explorers' League Document (4 of 6) : The document bears the Explorers' League crest and seems to detail transport routes utilized by the league into and out of Loch Modan. Sooty smudges lead you to believe it was likely stolen by the Dark Iron spies in the area.You recall mention of missing documents at the Explorers' League building in Thelsamar.
1305,"The Day that Deathwing Came: The Real Story : Not only was Theldurin's story wrong, it was boring, unimaginitive, and slow.I'll tell you how things really happened on that day."
1306,"When the Going Gets Tough, Cheat : I just can't get my invention to work!  Gah!That's it, I've decided.  I'm going to cheat and use magic.What my invention really needs is a solid piston that's thin enough to fit through a narrow copper tube, but strong enough to withstand repeated impact without breaking.  The magical rods carried by those ogre magi to the north should work perfectly.From what I can tell, only the instructors carry the strong staves."
1307,"A Little Slime Goes a Long Way : But the thing I've studied most is ooze. I know it sounds odd, but they're all over!I helped a lady in Menethil find her bag not too long ago--it was eaten by oozes. I've seen members of the Royal Apothecary Society from Undercity collecting samples of the stuff. I want to know why! Where does it come from?I've heard of more in Felwood. What I need are samples of the oozes there so I can further my research. I'll give you containers, you use them to collect a sample from the deceased creatures."
1308,Fine Linen Goods : The thugs in Elwynn wear linen which I can use to make fine linen goods.Bring me linen scraps and I'll use them to fashion something for you.You'll find those lawless criminals in pockets across Elwynn Forest.
1309,"A Daughter's Embrace : The whisper continues:<""My name is Lilian Voss.  Before I died, I was a member of the Scarlet Crusade.  My father, High Priest Voss, raised me to be a weapon against the plagued.  I studied stealth, sorcery, martial arts, anything to make myself stronger.  I gave up my childhood for him.""><""Then, as fate would have it, I died and returned as... this.  My father instantly forgot me and, when I returned, ordered me executed.""><""Come.  We will speak with him now, in his tower to the northwest."">"
1310,... It Will Come : I now imbue you with the energies of the corrupting faceless.Swim down to my luring totem in the trench to the northeast. Release the energies through it. Bring back the brain of their leader.Call forth to Ick'thys the Unfathomable... it will come!
1311,"All that Rises : <The voice of the ancient presses against your mind.>NOW THAT... YOU HAVE STOLEN... THE ENERGIES OF... THE FAITHFUL, ENTER... THE TEMPLE AND... DESTROY... HALLAZEAL THE ASCENDED!"
1312,"Prime Slime : I've become very interested in the slimes inhabiting Skulk Rock. No matter how many times they're cleared out, they seem to return, yet it doesn't seem they're capable of reproducing from a single slime.I think something's growing in there. There's a source where all the slimes come from, and I want to study it. Find this source, and bring me back a sample."
1313,The Hunt For Sylvanas : It's true then?  Gilneas has lost her favorite son.We will mourn when this is all over but not a day sooner.We will not allow ourselves the luxury of grief while the enemy still breathes Gilnean air.My father's men are ready to strike while we still have the Banshee Queen's trail.  Just say the word if you're ready.  Liam deserves swift vengeance.
1314,"Completionism : This is intolerable! The coins you brought me do not match the rest of the coins I already have! You aren't counterfeiting these are you? No? Hrumph. In that case I'm sorry we fought, dearie.  There's only one thing to do, buttercup: we need to complete the new set you've discovered. Bring me more misprinted coins!"
1315,"Decisions, Decisions : This is no magic solution to my curse! It's just a hammer!I may be crazy, but I'm not stupid.There's NO WAY I'm gunna use this to break my shiney - not after all I've gone through to get it.<Budd pauses in thought for a moment.>But that means I'm stuck down here for eternity...I had just learned to sail, you know.Ohhh... I can't decide.Here, you take the hammer and I'll just set the shiney down and look the other way."
1316,"Darnassian Intrusions : Besides the constant threat that the Wretched represent, I also have to deal with all kind of fictitious reports of night elf sightings.Though most reports are unfounded, one recent incident demands further investigation.  The West Sanctum, one of our primary energy sources, has suffered a terrible malfunction and rumors of Darnassian sabotage are rampant.Travel there and deal with anyone that looks suspicious.  Report back to Ley-Keeper Velania, who watches over the sanctum."
1317,To Fort Livingston : Da first place we check gonna be da place most likely to be attacked first.  You call it Fort Livingston.Fort Livingston be surrounded by troll ruins... It make for an easy target.Maybe we find da emissary dere.  Hopefully it ain't too late.
1318,"The Princess Trapped : My name is Myzrael.  I am a princess of the earth, and my captors, the giants, have trapped me deep beneath the Arathi Highlands.  These crystal shards are the only way I can speak with the surface world.Please help me.  Allies of the giants, the Drywhisker kobolds, have a shard like this one in their Drywhisker Gorge, to the east.  To power the cluster, you must gather motes of Myzrael from the kobolds and apply them to it.I beg you, <name>, aid me!"
1319,"Dask ""The Flask"" Gobfizzle : Hey - you must be that <fella'/lass> that Wulfred was talkin' about!  The one who found the ogre artifact, and helped him test out those strange stones from up north.  Welcome to the digsite, <name>!We were actually working on identifying those samples right as you got here.  Would you mind bringing the sample over to Dask?  I need him to help me find out how old it is."
1320,"Freedom for Lydon : This place is no farm! Stillwater has been experimenting on the humans of Hillsbrad. The monstrosities here are all his creations.That's not the worst of it, <class>. The aberrations that have the key to my cage are former Forsaken. Stillwater's experiments have the side effect of turning Forsaken into mindless zombies. Why do you think he's so afraid of letting this get out? He knows that such a crime is punishable by true death.Get me out of here! The infected sludge guards outside have the key!"
1321,"A Nose for This Sort of Thing : <The skull speaks to you.>I live?  No, I do not... but I can.That raptor you have is wise to have found my skull among what must have been so many.  In life, I was strong, powerful, a lord among trolls.  With your help, I can be a lord once more.The Bloodscalps at Zuuldaia hoard magical fetishes that can help me return.  They hide these artifacts under the sand.  Use your hatchling to find these artifacts, <name>... then throw them in the pot."
1322,"Onwards to Menethil : This news needs to get to Menethil as soon as possible. I'll send you along on my fastest ram, <name>.He knows the way, just make sure you're steady in the saddle and hold on tight.Don't dawdle around the camp. We've got to send word quickly!"
1323,"Zen'Kiki and the Cultists : While you've been away, I've been trying a different approach on our friend Zen'Kiki.  I believe he may have a future as a healer.  This is mainly because healing spells never miss.I hear from Field Agent Kaartish that the cultist camp to the east is where the plagued animals are coming from.  I hope you don't mind escorting Zen'Kiki over there... perhaps he can help heal some of the plagued animals within the camp."
1324,Hidden Treasures : Daddy told me to give you this key.  He said it opens a chest out back behind the house.He also wanted me to thank you.  Did you do a favor for him?  Did you tell him you found my doll?Well here's the key.  And thank you <name>.  Thank you!  You're a very nice <man/lady>!
1325,"Frederick's Fish Fancy : I love the sea.  Yes, it was I, Frederick Calston, who introduced the sea life to that lake in the southwest.  I had hoped to provide the Crusade with a source of fresh food from within the borders of the Plaguelands.However, some of the fish turned out to be predators, and they now terrorize the other animals.  If we're not careful, they will kill them all!Swim down to the bottom of the scar and save some snails, crabs, and pufferfish before it's too late."
1326,"Cozzle's Plan : I may be of Darkspear birth, but I spent my childhood here, in Stranglethorn Vale.  I've seen everything there is to see here in Stranglethorn, but the most offensive is the devastation that the Venture Company has done to the riverbed.To make things worse, Foreman Cozzle and his crew have been increasing their activity, and I suspect they have some new plan.  Succeed where I failed, <name>: Kill Cozzle, obtain his key, and steal the blueprints from his apartment."
1327,"The Daughter Who Lived : I should have told you this earlier...How do I put this...Morgan may have believed that his family was all dead, but, in fact, his daughter Sarah Ladimore is now a Watcher. She's always been troubled by the... circumstances... surrounding her father's death. Perhaps you could go to bring the news to her."

1329,"Treasure Reclamation : Blood and thunder! We have our reinforcements, but they still need to be paid. They won't be cheap.Up on Deepfin Ridge to the northwest, the slimy gilblin have stolen all sorts of treasure. It's time to reclaim some of it for the Horde.Hellscream's eyes are upon you, <name>!"
1330,"Four Heads are Better than None : We're about to launch the attack upon the Twilight Gate, but there is one last loose end to tie up: Za'brox and Beeble'phod, the disciples of Cho'gall.Intelligence has placed them within the Den of the Disciples, a small ogre cave at the southwest corner of the Twilight Gate.Would you go back in there and kill them?"
1331,"Minor Distractions : Nethergarde has stood steadfast for years against the demon onslaught that plagues this land.  Our watch is never-ending, our vigilance unfaltering, and our courage bottomless.We have held these lands since the portal opened, but now these Horde insects have the insolence to stand in our way!?  We have protected THEM as well as we have protected ourselves!<Lungertz looks you over.>Let's see if you've got a hand for combat.  Slay one of the Horde's Okril'lon scouts that nibble at our perimeter."
1332,"Done Nothing Wrong : The Blackrock orcs of the steppes serve a dark master -  one who performs twisted experiments on living creatures to create his own menagerie of abominations.  Many of his test subjects are as corrupted as their master, but others are completely innocent.In the whelping downs to the south, they chain baby dragons to the ground, preparing them for such experiments.  I will not stand for this.  Break their fetters and return the hatchlings to me... to safety."
1333,"A Physical Specimen : The soul is ready, but the body is not.  For a skull as well-formed, as marvelous, as beautiful as this... we will need a suitable body.The chief of the Bloodscalps, Gan'zulah, won his throne with brute force.  If he still lives, you'll find him in Zul'Kunda, to the west.Taking his body won't be easy, but nothing a sturdy <class> like yourself couldn't handle.  Bring it back here when you're done."
1334,One Draenei's Junk... : A shard of glimmering rock sits before you.  You sense that this item would be of value to someone within the Blasted Lands.
1335,"Investigate the Amani Catacombs : <class>, our sources tell us that the trolls buried in the Amani Catacombs inside Sungraze Peak have been rising from the dead. Dame Auriferous would have you investigate these catacombs and put to the torch any of the unanimated remains you come across so as to prevent any more of these creatures from rising.The fastest way there is to head north out of town and then take the first fork to the right. This will put you on the north side of the peak, so look to the south for the entrance."
1336,"Keep An Eye Out : Avast!  Who goes there?Argh, I am but useless without me special enchanted eye.  Bad enough to have lost me eyes in battle in the first place!  But by some stroke o' luck we docked in Menethil and a traveling wizard enchanted a special glass eye that let me see again.Last night I ended up gettin' jumped by some Bloodsail Buccaneers on me way out.  Took me eye, they did!  Seems those blokes have found their way to Booty Bay.Help an old sea dog out by gettin' me eye back?"
1337,"Aradne : Our last hope of victory lies in defeating the val'kyr.  You've done well up until now... but you're only one <man/woman> and there are literally dozens of them raining destruction on the battlefield.One enormous val'kyr sits atop the tower to our south... you can see her from here.  Perhaps if we eliminate her, the remaining val'kyr will dissipate.This is our only hope.  Bring some of Grant's men with you.  You'll need their protection for this battle."
1338,"A Blight Upon the Land : With the undead outbreak contained, the time has come for Stillwater and his followers to answer for their crimes. Though we averted a tragedy the likes of which has not been seen since the Scourge invaded, we must ensure that such a thing can never happen again. They will all face true death!Come, <name>! I will have Stillwater's head!"
1339,"Hope for the People : About four years ago, in the dead of the night, a little girl walked right into our farmhouse and collapsed on the floor. Nobody had a clue as to her identity. The poor little thing had no recollection of who she was or where she came from - truly a lost soul.Soon after, we adopted the little girl and named her Hope - for that is what she represented.She is now a young lady, caring for the destitute and homeless of Westfall. Take my Westfall stew to her at Sentinel Hill, south of here."
1340,"A Fiery Reunion : That's Magmatooth, my estranged fire elemental. <name>, you gotta kill him or he's gonna kill me!It was all just a big misunderstanding. How was I to know he'd be mad about me ""borrowing"" his heart down in Deepholm? He can't die... not permanently anyway!He's got the controller to the portal on him for sure. You gotta get the controller and then use it in the Fire portal to take us back to the entrance."
1341,"The Horde's Hoard : It is unclear what manner of creature scrawled the seemingly random markings on this piece of parchment, but upon close inspection, some of the obscure shapes begin to look like landmarks.Scanning the sea floor, you think you recognize a few points of reference, one being a nearby sunken ship. If your guess is correct, there appears to be treasure of some kind near the wreck.You cannot help but wonder what the scaly, serpentine figure on the map might represent...."
1342,"Better Late Than Dead : Greetings, friend.It is good to see that you survived your battle in one piece.While Erunak tries to scry a place of safety for us all, I shall assist you in securing a less strenuous means of transport.I have prepared this baitstick to use near a sea turtle. It is crude, but it should serve to bring one under your control.Once you've become comfortable with the animal, simply guide it back here to me."
1343,"A Different Approach : Among other things, Zen'Kiki needs to work on his spell accuracy.  I could see his wrath spells spiraling out of control even from here!  In fact, I used them as a marker to follow your progress through the woods.Perhaps we can use Zen'Kiki another way.  Take him up to the top of the hill just to our east.  The diseased hawks that circle above that hill must be destroyed.  Ask Zen'Kiki to shoot at these hawks.  Even if he can't hit them, he will distract them so you can finish them off."
1344,"Gidwin Goldbraids : I love my boys, don't get me wrong.  But I TOLD them that I needed FIVE MINUTES to water and brush the horses, and what did they do?  They made a stupid bet with each other and ran off!  I should have known better... this always happens.Gidwin's the short one.  He headed north, along the river.  If you're headed that direction, would you tell him to come back?  We've got to get to Light's Hope Chapel, and I'm not against leaving without him."
1345,Hints of the Past : As you skim through the pages in the journal you're overcome by an unnerving sense of being watched.The contents are unsettling.  Dar'Khan's soul was one filled with hatred and contempt for his own people.  The extent of his machinations and plots are all documented in great detail.Perhaps there is something here that Vynna will find useful.
1346,"Not Just Any Body : Loramus Thalipedes is dead.  Well, let me step back... that's an assumption on my part, but I do know that his body lies in three pieces.<Lynnore ponders for a moment.>If you bring me the pieces, we still have a recourse.  All three pieces are nearby... the Dreadmaul ogres hide them in their caves.  In fact, one of them is in that chest, down the ledge behind me..."
1347,"Message in a Bottle : Inside the bottle you find a note which reads, in fairly good handwriting:<To any that can aid me-><Please, my need for help is dire. A great beast holds me captive on an island in the South Seas.><The stars at night are foreign to me and obscured by the jungle trees, but on the clearest days I see shoreline to the northwest, and what seem to be large sailing ships to the southwest.><I beg of you, my would-be savior, please help me.>"
1348,"Alina's Reward : The tale of Trol'kalar ends here, then. It will be a weapon to bring death to the living, in the name of the Dark Lady.Leave me now, <name>. My job is once again to guard the blade. Tell Alina of your victory, I'm sure she will have a reward for you."
1349,"Doublerum : <Baron Revilgaz sighs.>  Even with all my suspicions about Firallon's plot, we aren't prepared for a full two-front attack between the Bloodsail and the Brashtide.  It's going to take a small miracle to hold Booty Bay today.I've got a barrel of Doublerum in my chambers.  Take the stairs down three flights, and check the first door on your right.  You can ignore the warnings on the barrel... those should be the least of your worries."
1350,"The Crucible of Carnage: Calder's Creation! : Grim and gory, this next match is sure to have the crowd groanin' one way or another. Calder Gray has been gathering the bodyparts of defeated challengers and building the perfect champion.This thing is the ultimate cobbled collaboration of corpsified combatants. A magnificent mashup of mangled monstrosities. Are you ready to get messy?! Cause I am! Let me know when you're ready so we can get this thing started!"
1351,"Journey's End : I've had just about enough of the funk of this place.  Undead stink is bad enough, and then you add mushrooms to the mix?  I hate mushrooms!I'm going to head back to Light's Hope Chapel, <name>... and I'm taking Tarenar and Fiona with me.  I think we've all earned a well-deserved break.Let me give you this.  It's my hearthstone - you can use it to travel instantly back to Light's Hope.  I won't need it - I'm going to be riding in the caravan.In the FRONT SEAT."
1352,"The Road to Purgation : The time of vengeance has come, <name>. Kasha can once more fly, thanks to you. She will take us to Purgation Isle so that we may confront the Stormpike dwarf general, Vanndar Stormpike, and his captain, Balinda Stonehearth. BOTH will pay for what they have done.Are you ready? Orkus cannot do this alone."
1353,"Wand over Fist : Hey, <name>. Sorry to be so short with ye earlier... and no, that ain't a pun.I figured out where Trelane's first item ended up: Kor'gresh has it in Boulderfist Hall. An' by the way he was throwing down blasts of ice at his kin to keep them in line, he must be close to figurin' out how to use all of its powers.Boulderfist Hall's south of here an' then east of Thandol Span. Find the ogre an' get back that wand.While you're gone, I'll figure out what we're gonna do about Stromgarde."
1354,"Ix'lar the Underlord : I know we're supposed to head to Northdale, but that can wait, right?  Besides, this lovely little goblin was just telling me about some Scourge that are even closer by.So apparently there's this nerubian underlord named Ix'lar that has been trying to make a name for himself ever since the Lich King was slain.  He's set up a camp of undead to our north.Sure, Tyrosus wants us to kill banshees in Northdale.  We'll get to that.  But let's kill this nerubian first, while we're close!"
1355,"Blackrock Invasion : The orcs have begun burning down the forest, <name>! They have taken over the vineyard to the east and are planning their final assault against us! They must be stopped!Head east, across the river, and kill the rampaging Blackrock orcs. Collect their weapons as proof of their demise and return to me.You're our only hope, <name>!"
1356,"Fathom-Lord Zin'jatar : The Fathom-Lord is here, at the far side of the ruins. He's still injured from our last battle.I'll leave this pleasure to you. Make sure he doesn't get away this time."
1357,"By Her Lady's Word : Lady Sira'kess has begun preparations for the ritual of summoning, but the Crucible of Nazsharin has been stolen from us. The Kvaldir have surely taken it with them as they retreated to shallower waters.Speak to the caste leaders to secure a war party, and then lead them in retrieving the artifact from Biel'aran Ridge to the east.I trust you my Battlemaiden, for you have never failed in any task that I have given you. As I am revered to the Queen, so are you revered to me. Go with my blessings."
1358,"Pay Attention! : Listen, <race>. It's not that I don't appreciate the rescue and all, but this is a dire situation.You have to pay better attention out there!I was watching, and you passed right over a busted alliance crate.There's bound to be something in there that could help me and my boys.How about you get out there and take a look-see, hrm?"
1359,"Shadowhide Extinction : Now that every Blackrock orc south of Lake Everstill is nothing more than ash and cinder, we can turn our attention to the Shadowhide gnoll army of Galardell Valley, directly north of here.I want you to head out there and kill 'em all, <name>! Initiate Operation: Extinction, soldier. For Bravo Company and for the Alliance!"
1360,"Call of the Warmatron : Our venerable warmatron, Okrilla, has sent me to the far reaches of the world in search of suitable heroes that would join our cause. Are you interested in strengthening the Horde's grasp over the Eastern Kingdoms? Then take this portal to the Blasted Lands and report to Okrilla at Dreadmaul Hold!"
1361,"Iron Horde Invasion : By order of his royal highness, King Varian Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Vindicator Maraad at the Shattered Beachhead in Blasted Lands.Use the portal at the Wizard's Sanctum in Stormwind to head directly to the front line.This new threat is known only as the Iron Horde. They have taken over the Dark Portal and must be stopped.For the glory and honor of the Alliance!"
1362,"Human Infestation : This mine was once the heart of Alliance mining operations in Hillsbrad. It now serves as a breeding ground for our loyal spiders, though, the humans still occupy it - in a way.<Keyton grins.>But onto business! Warden Stillwater has called for more workers at the Sludge Fields. I want you to enter the mine with these shackles and capture Hillsbrad humans for labor in the fields.Break them out of their web paralysis and beat them into submission before you use the shackles."
1363,"Shadra the Venom Queen : No time to waste, <name>! She's comin' out of the water right now!Gryphon Master Talonaxe is comin' right now with the boys, let's show that bug what for!"
1364,"The Fate of Morbent Fel : Before I was lost to the woods, the last thing I remember is Morbent Fel. He was a vile necromancer, and the reason this land swarms with so many vile undead.I asked an adventurer to help me put an end to him. I thought they did! But Sister Elsington tells me the land still crawls with ghouls and spectres ripped from the grave.Morbent Fel should have breathed his last in the house on Forlorn Rowe, north of Raven Hill Cemetery. Go there and see what's become of him..."
1365,"For Peat's Sake : The elementals rampaging across Direforge Hill are setting the very land beneath them ablaze. In a marsh such as this, fire can find many places to smoulder through the deep moss and peat.You must quench the fires before they spread further. Take this flower... blessed by nature's rain, it will let you douse the fires.The blossom may also prove useful against the elementals themselves."
1366,"Bio-Fuel : Submarine fuel is expensive!The powers-that-be in Gnomeregan were generous enough to deliver several fuel barrels, but we're burning through it faster than expected.  That means we're going to need to improvise.It's a well-known fact that sea creatures are full of all kinds of interesting chemicals... like oil.  Take this device up to Kothrun's End and stick it into the corpses of terrapins, remoras, and hammerhead sharks.  If we don't get more submarine fuel, their oil might be our only hope."
1367,"Latent Disease : I need plagued grass for an... an experiment, of sorts.  Those Argent Crusaders and those infernal Cenarion druids have done too good a job of healing the plaguelands, however... and I can't find proper reagents within a reasonable walking distance.Some of the local wildlife retain the plague's touch, however.  Kill a diseased black bear, then retrieve the grass that grows where its decaying body lies.  It's not optimal, but it'll do."
1368,"A Wolf in Bear's Clothing : These worgen take us for fools! One would think that only an idiot would mistake one of their druids in bear form as a real bear. Unfortunately, there are many idiots here at the Forsaken Front. We've already lost a few battalions to organized worgen bear attacks. Yes, it's even more idiotic than it sounds.Directly east of here, heading towards Hillsbrad, you will find worgen druids roaming the woods, masquerading as bears. Kill them and make our southern supply line safe again."
1369,"Blasted Lands: The Other Side of the World : Now here's an interesting one.  It says that members of the Horde should talk to Okrilla at Dreadmaul Hold.Hmph! I didn't even know that the Horde held Dreadmaul Hold!I guess this Okrilla requires help fighting some ogres and the Alliance. You'd think she'd already have her hands full with all the demons down there!The best way to Dreadmaul Hold is to cross the Great Sea, then to take the road south from the Swamp of Sorrows.You interested?"
1370,Under Siege : Those Iron Horde cannons are laying waste to our troops. I'm not sure how much more of this we can handle. Our forces are already spread too thin.There has to be a way to stop those war machines.
1371,"To the Aid of the Thorium Brotherhood : Dark Iron dwarves may be scheming and mischievous... but they're not all enemies.  I've spoken several times with the dwarves of the Thorium Brotherhood, and they've never been anything but helpful.An acquaintance of mine, Jack Rockleg, came to town not long ago, asking if I could join him on an expedition of some sort.  It sounded important.I'm a little busy, but maybe you wouldn't mind going?  Just travel west, on the road to Searing Gorge.  You'll see him soon after leaving the Badlands."
1372,"The Threat of Flame : Flame has threatened me for far too long... far too long... but it is no longer the little ones, no longer mere gnats...The fields burn! The hills and highlands scream, <race>, they scream. The elementals brought here consume all life in their wake.They cannot stand, they cannot stand. Stop them. STOP THEM! Destroy the bringers of flame..."
1373,"The Battle of Thandol Span : I've defended the Thandol Span from being destroyed before, against the Dark Iron themselves. And so did my father, and his father before him...The only Dark Iron that managed to give me the slip ran straight for the bridge. Something's amiss, and I'm betting when we get there we'll be waltzing right into an ugly trap.I could use your help, <name>, for Ironforge. Are you with me?"
1374,"The Great Escape : With our mission objective secured, the time has come for us to make our escape. Though Gilneas is lost, with the aid of Godfrey and his lieutenants we will have it back in no time at all.Go now, <name>. Fly back with Arthura to the Forsaken Front in southern Silverpine Forest. The Banshee Queen awaits your arrival."
1375,"Amidst Death, Life : Scourge forces have made it a point to ensure that nothing survives in the Fungal Vale - all you will find are husks of rotted mushrooms and scorched grasses.  The three corners of the vale are home to three large ziggurats, which they use to reanimate their dead and summon new soldiers to the battlefield.Yet even in this evil, lifeless place, life finds a way to flourish.  Take my seeds and plant them in the centers of these ziggurats.  Prove to them that life will prevail."
1376,Glorious Harvest : Directly southeast of Southpoint Gate you will find our spider domestication operations. Through the years we have grown a kinship with the spiders of Hillsbrad and have managed to domesticate and breed the adorable little critters. Spiders now serve us as regular household pets and beasts of battle! Such diverse creatures they are!I need you to head into the fields to the southeast and carefully harvest the eggs that we have incubating on the bears. Deliver the harvest to Sarus at the mine.
1377,"Here Fishie Fishie : <Orako rolls the glow-juice into a ball, then attaches it to a device that he's clearly been working on for a long time.>Here, I got you this hat.  It has a light on it, and it will make fish follow you.  Just like the murlocs!The murlocs like to hunt in the kelp and coral along the sides of the canyon.  If you put on this hat and swim in that kelp, you might catch some fish like they do."
1378,From the Belly of the Beast : I think we can rebuild him. Perhaps if we put him back together he can give us information about Crowley.We must kill every crocolisk in this marsh until we find the rest of Sean Dempsey's body! From the belly of the beast this man will be reborn!
1379,"The Reckoning : Loken killed my wife, turned my followers and me against each other.  He took away everything I had, but today... that changes.Today we reclaim our sacred grounds.  Today... Loken dies.Meet me on the bridge near the Temple of Wisdom, just southwest of Ulduar.  I will finish this one way or the other.I need you there as a witness.  You will not aid me -- this is personal.After it's done, send word to Jokkum, King of the Frost Giants.  He's a good friend and will know what to do."
1380,"Goggle Boggle : Now that we are full-fledged Blackwater Raiders it is our job to help Mr. O'Breen locate the lost elven treasure.It is next to impossible to find the gems in the dark sea without aid. The doctor has constructed some goggles that will help. He needs the goggles charged with the energy derived from the enchanted stone in the cave just up the hill.But the cave is cursed! When we get close, we get ambushed. Defend me and I can harness the energy from the stone into the goggles."
1381,"I'm Not Supposed to Tell You This : My daddy always kept two swords: one for fighting with men, and one for hunting the animals.  I wasn't supposed to touch his swords, but I knew where he hid them.One day, he told my mommy that he was going to fight a ""lone hunter"" in the hills to the east, but he brought his animal sword with him!  When he came back, he didn't have his sword with him.When daddy comes back, he'll be so happy when I give him his animal sword!  Will you go and find it?"
1382,"Snapjaws, Mon! : Don't let their big eyes fool you, mon! Those saltwater snapjaws be a menace. I can't fish for five minutes without getting a broken line from one of those oversized fish vacuums stealing my bait.Do me and the people of Revantusk Village a service and kill em, mon.Kill the whole lot of em!"
1383,"Pupellyverbos Port : You there! Did you know that strewn across the northern beach are tens, if not hundreds, of bottles of fine wine?...well, now you do!I'd be out there gathering them by the armload, if those turtles weren't out to get me. They crave my blood, I swear.So I'll pay you then. Bring me 12 bottles of Pupellyverbos Port and I'll ""purchase"" it from you, <class>."
1384,"Something Edible : Were they trying to starve us all to death?! Not giving prisoners food is just despicable.We need to get these soldiers fed. The best prospect I spotted on the way here were those giant grouper. Several of those and we shouldn't want for meat for a while.If you can bring me back some, I'll see to it that it gets cooked and passed out fairly."
1385,"Steel Thunder : We may not have to live down the shame of this defeat, <name>. The Warchief will likely have us all executed instead.I'll be damned if we don't go down without a fight. Although the whole beachhead is overrun by Bloodfang worgen, there may still be hope. I want you to accompany one of our sea pups to the beachhead, directly west of here, and recover our supplies. Return to me when the pup can carry no more."
1386,"Memories from a Lost Past : It's funny the things you remember.  I spent 16 hours a day working the fields, and every seventh day I'd head into bustling Andorhal to sell what I'd grown.  It was a tough life, but we did alright.But I barely remember any of that.  When I think back to those days, I think about Gloria's smile, or Andrea waving from the window whenever I'd look up from the plow.The farm's just a bit to the east, but I'm not sure I'm ready to go back, <name>.  I'd just like to make sure I hold on to these memories."
1387,"The Altar of Storms : Up on the bluffs above our comfy cave is a powerful altar.  A powerful DEMONIC altar, guarded by cultists, but powerful nonetheless.  If you can reach it, you can use it to bring Loramus back to us.The altar will likely resist your efforts, so you'll have to protect Loramus' body while the ritual completes.  Bring the demon hunter back to me afterwards."
1388,"Into The Abyss : The Horde and Alliance are locked in battle with one another in the seas to the west.Below them, a great host of enemies prepares to carry out a plan that could be the undoing of us all.I am sending you to speak with the admiral of the alliance forces. Share with him the vision you have seen. Convince him to focus his attention on the true threat below, before it grows too late...To gain audience with the admiral, you must first enlist with the recruiter at the harbor."
1389,"A Strange Request : On to other matters.  I have a package that I need delivered.A young lady came by our town not long ago, looking for compressed blasting powder, a tempered mithril bomb casing, and some safety goggles.  Naturally, we had plenty of blasting powder and bomb casings to sell her, but the safety goggles were a little harder to find.Long story short, I've got the goggles, but she's already returned to her studies down in Lethlor Ravine.  Will you bring these down to her?"
1390,"Kobold Candles : Hello, <good sir/my lady>!  Do you have a moment?My brother and I run an apothecary in Stormwind, and I'm here to gather large candles for their wax.  Can you help me?You can get large candles from kobolds, and I hear rumors that kobolds are infesting the Elwynn mines... the Fargodeep Mine to the south and Jasperlode Mine to the east.  I suggest looking for candles in one of those places."
1391,"They Build a Better Bullet : Those gorge-digging dwarves do at least one thing right: they make very high-quality bullets.  I've been unable to reproduce their results, so I've taken to stealing whatever bullets of theirs that I can find.Ye want my help?  Get me a couple hundred bullets from those marksmen below.I'm sure they'll be happy to give ye their bullets one at a time, but you might find it faster just to look for the crates filled with them."
1392,"It's All Mine : All over this cavern you'll find unguarded piles of ore, just waiting to be tampered with.  Our first choice would be to steal the ore, obviously, but that requires mine carts, protection, and labor... three things we just don't have.  So instead, we're just going to ruin this little mining party with a little bit of highly corrosive solvent.Take this bottle - CAREFULLY - and pour it onto those heaps of ore.  'Cause if we can't have this ore, then neither can they."
1393,"Foxes and Hounds : These Alliance forces walk around the Plaguelands like they own the place.  Well, they don't!  This land rightfully belongs to the Dark Lady!As the battle for Andorhal drew to a close, the Alliance forces occupying the Plaguelands scattered.  Several of them can be found just east of here, hunting foxes.  Prove to them that this is Forsaken territory.Kill the hunters.  Kill their hunting dogs.  And kill the foxes they hunt, for good measure."
1394,"Twilight Extermination : NOW, TAKE... THE ATTUNED RUNESTONE... AND USE... IT TO POSSESS... ONE OF... THE BOUND TORRENTS... AT... THE CENTRAL TEMPLE. THEY WILL IGNORE... YOU. YOU ARE BENEATH... THEIR NOTICE.USE... THE ELEMENTAL'S POWERS... TO DESTROY... THE TWILIGHT DEVOTEES... AND... THEIR... FACELESS OVERSEERS."
1395,"Break in Communications: Dreadwatch Outpost : I'm not gonna lie to you, <name>. What I'm about to ask you to do is suicide. Chance of failure is about 95%.All communication from Dreadwatch Outpost has been severed. With the worgen constantly rushing us we have no means by which to get to Dreadwatch to check on our soldiers. I need you to head south to the outpost and check on our soldiers. I'll keep in contact through the Forsaken communication device - F.C.D. - from here on out.KEEP CLEAR OF THE MAIN ROAD."
1396,"Slowing the Inevitable : As much as I want to exact swift and brutal revenge... I must honor my son's memory first.  He cared for his people first and foremost.The Undertaker's Pass goes underground below Northgate River.  You must prevent the plague from being deployed while we evacuate our men, women and children to Aderic's Repose.We captured one of the Forsaken's dreaded bombing bats.  I want you to fly the infernal beast as best you can and unleash hell upon those who seek to bring the Plague to our people.  Hurry!"
1397,"Graverobbers : The mass graves within the forest to the west of us were made to accommodate the... impressive... number of deaths Tirisfal suffered when the plague first came.  The bodies in these graves have so far been spared an undeath, but the Scourge now send Rot Hide gnolls to gather the corpses and use them to bolster their armies.  This cannot be allowed!Your task is twofold: slay the Rot Hides at the mass grave and Garren's Haunt, and gather from them the embalming ichor that gives them life."
1398,"Supporting the Troops : I'm no military expert, but this battle looks to be in our favor.  Our defenders are equally matched with their deathguards, but the farmers' militia has taken them by surprise from the rear.  For the Alliance!Still, we should all do what we can to make sure that we win.  Travel east into Andorhal and slay the Forsaken deathguards that are fighting with our men.  The sooner they die, the quicker we can re-take Andorhal!"
1399,"Demoniac Vessel : We need a way to get Wormthorn's attention.  Something to break him out of his trance.  Something that's guaranteed to work.The few types of wildlife that managed to make a foothold in the Tainted Forest are, without a doubt, affected by the land's latent energies.  Your task is to collect their body parts and find a way to combine them into a vessel.  If Wormthorn's trance is druidic, or even if it is demonic, a large enough vessel of tainted animal flesh should be able to break it."
1400,"Warchief's Command: Ghostlands! : All able bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Arcanist Vandril at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands.Your help is needed to turn back the numberless Scourge invaders and secure the help of the Forsaken in fighting our common enemy.To reach Tranquillien, follow the road south from Fairbreeze Square and into the Ghostlands.Destiny calls!"
1401,"Hero's Call: Loch Modan! : By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Pilot Hammerfoot at South Gate Outpost.The destruction of the Stonewrought Dam and the resurgence of the kobolds and troggs has the mountaineers stretched thin. Reinforcements are desperately needed! Travel east through South Gate Pass from eastern Dun Morogh to reach South Gate Outpost.For the glory and honor of the Alliance!"
1402,"Home Is Where the Hearth Is : I don't know about you, but all this running around has got me thirsty!  Why don't we head over to the Pig and Whistle Tavern and rest our legs over some cool pints of moonberry juice?  While we're there, speak with Meagan the innkeeper to make the Pig and Whistle Tavern your new home. That way, if you ever find yourself stranded without a flight master nearby, you can use your hearthstone to return to the inn.  Not only is it faster than a gryphon, but you'll save a few copper in the process!"
1403,"Farstrider Retreat : Your help in subduing the Wretched has been invaluable.  The Farstriders would surely have use for someone like you in their fight against the Amani trolls.Look for the Farstrider Retreat to the northeast of here, speak to Lieutenant Dawnrunner and see what assistance she might need."
1404,"Relios the Relic Keeper : The Dark Lady is correct in her assertion that I am able to unlock the codex. Unfortunately, I need a signet ring from a Dalaran archmage to do it. My own ring was taken when I died many years ago, but there still might be a way.While Dalaran has floated away, the outskirts of the city remain. Far to the east lie the ruins of Dalaran. It is there that you will find an archmage known as Relios. ""Take"" his signet ring and bring it back to me.You may use the portal behind me to get to the crater."
1405,I Never Forget a Face : You have discovered a partially digested head. Lord Godfrey perks up when he sees it. Perhaps you should give it to him.
1406,"Zaeldarr the Outcast : Can you believe that, after all the trouble we have in the Plaguelands... we have to worry about thieves too?  And not just normal thieves, troll thieves.And not just normal troll thieves.  Dead troll thieves!They're led by this big, dead troll named Zaeldarr the Outcast, and they come here at night and steal bodies from our graveyards, then take them back to their evil, dead troll hideout--the Undercroft to the southwest.Go there and take out Zaeldarr, <name>.  I'm sick to death of his mischief!"
1407,"Can't Take It With Them : Any shipping crew I had that you don't see hanging around this camp are DEAD! Those were some fine goblins, but what's worse is they're all still out there! It's a TRAGEDY!I mean, it's a tragedy they still have all their stuff! It's horrifying to think of all the perfectly good materials and coins sitting out there in the water.Hey! You can do me a favor! If you're killing gilblins out there, go get the ditty bags off my old crewmen!C'mon, they're not gonna need it anymore! Be real!"
1408,"It's Raid Night Every Night : The reports I'm sending Captain Tharran can't really convey the amount of trouble the Frostmanes have created for us. Your assault on the village has started to relieve some of the pressure. The raids are still frequent, but the trolls don't have the numbers they once did.Even so, my men are tired and their morale is flagging. Would you help us keep watch for the Frostmane raiders? They could turn up at any time."
1409,"A Better Vantage : This cave is our only refuge. There's no help on the way. Whatever happens, this cave must remain safe or we are all sure to die down here.We need a forward post to launch our attacks from. Something defensible.In the eastern portion of the ruins on the lowest level, scout the north end of the gardens, the passage leading under the main structure just west of the gardens, and the cluster of buildings at the southeast corner of the ruins, under the bridges.Bring me back any information you can."
1410,"It's Alive! : From what I've heard, all you really need to do is find a suitable harvest golem and drop in the heart. Once you've done that you should be able to take full control of the creature.I think there's a whole field of overloaded harvest golems west of here, at the Molsen Farm. Look for the arcs of electricity.Should you manage to get it working, use the golem to destroy the energized harvest reapers at the old Molsen farm. Those monsters are much more destructive than the ones on our farm."
1411,"The Maw of Madness : I can't believe it, <name>. Me own son - me own flesh and blood! Throwing his lot in with those fiends from the Twilight's Hammer. Did you see what he became when he tried to destroy the wedding? Oh ... why? Why?It's that beast, <name>. The enormous mouth emerging from the earth to our west. ""The Maw of Madness!"" My son said it spoke to him, but I thought it was just nightmares.The Earthen Ring is trying to destroy it. Go to Earthcaller Torunscar, west of here, and see how you can help!"
1412,"Taking the Fall : Antheol is going to fly off his rocker when he finds out his book is ruined.  I've got a little proposal for you; don't worry, I'll make it worth your while.Take this book to him and tell him nothing of this incident.  If he asks, just tell him you dropped the book into a puddle.  He has no direct authority over you, so there's not much he can do.Antheol delivers his lectures at Stillwhisper Pond, southeast of Silvermoon.  You'll do this for us, right?  I'll reward you handsomely for this favor!"
1413,"Anok'suten : Come closer, I am ... dying.I was sent here ... to slay these nerubians, but Vandril didn't ... know that they have a leader.<The dying blood elf coughs up a good amount of blood.>You must find and ... slay Anok'suten.  Get help.  She wanders around ... Suncrown Village."
1414,"Counter-Plague Research : I once worked for the so-called ""Banshee-Queen"", Sylvanas, as an apothecary.  I used to admire her, but something's changed within her.  She's not herself anymore.I broke my vows with the Forsaken and joined the Crusade.  Now, I use my knowledge of alchemy to seek a counter-plague agent.  And the Plaguewood is the perfect place to do so.I need to resupply a few reagents, any of which can be found within the Plaguewood.  I'll pay you if you can find any of these items."
1415,"Dusky Crab Cakes : I'll let you in on a little secret - Dusky ""Crab"" Cakes are really made from spider meat!  I know it's a bit disgusting, but the cakes have a nice, tangy flavor and make great snacks!If you want to try some still, I'm afraid I'm out of meat. I need some lump meat to whip up a few more cakes.Venom Web Spiders are a good source - they nest to the north, between the foothills and the river."
1416,"All That Skitters : There's somethin' I've noticed up there... Jintha'Alor's full of spiders. Small ones about as big as yer hand. Not an unusual sight for the Hinterlands, but somethin's amiss.To be honest, I don't trust the trolls to keep pets. They're up to somethin'. I need you to bring me some of those spiders. Keep 'em alive if you can, and we'll see what the spirits tell me..."
1417,"Capture the Crab : Everything in my body tells me that Nespirah is trying to speak with me, but I cannot hear her.  Perhaps the naga have done something to her voice.<Duarn thinks to himself for a moment.>Nespirah's voice may be suppressed... that means... we need to find a voice for her!I've got it!  The Idra'kess have been known to train deepseeker crabs as battle companions.  Use this net to capture a crab, and bring it to me.  You will likely find them prowling the chamber's outer edges."
1418,"Jurrix the Striker : Oh, you want to talk?  Fine.I'm Jurrix, the only merc here with half a brain.  The only one with any bite to my attacks, too.  The only reason I keep these meat shields around is to keep myself from getting killed.Listen, you're the boss of this operation.  You give the word, and I'll send a fireball right through your target's heart.  If things start getting hectic, I can even warp time a bit so you can fit in a few extra attacks.Why don't we go try fighting together?"
1419,Old Whitebark's Pendant : The pendant has the initials L.R. etched on to it.  Perhaps these letters will lead to the pendant's maker.
1420,"Waiting to Exsanguinate : The Gilneas Liberation Front leader, Darius Crowley, has been meeting with another worgen inside this cottage for the past three days. I'm not sure what's going on, but we need to get inside the cottage and find a good hiding place from where we can eavesdrop.It's now or never, <race>. We may never get another shot.Just promise me that if I don't make it, you'll return to Forsaken High Command and inform Belmont of whatever we discover."
1421,"Burnin' at Both Ends : Har! We get to jump right inta the action, <name>. Looks like Highbank has whatcha call a zeppelin problem: that airship is poundin' the crap outta the walls.Listen, I've got me an idear so stupid it's genius. I just need some cannon powder.Collect as much as you can find around Highbank an' meet me by the trade area!"
1422,"The Stolen Letters : You want to know about Stalvan...You're not the first, you know. We get outsiders coming through asking about him every so often. Always outsiders. Everyone who lives here knows better.You're out of luck, anyway. I'm missing half the archives. Feral worgen broke into the town hall not a few nights ago and tore the place to shreds.The documents you'll want are probably strewn all across Brightwood Grove by now, deep in the woods to the west. Not worth it if you ask me."
1423,"Mauti : I got da feeling dat somethin' ain't right wit' dat panther, <name>.  It ain't natural.  I gonna need to perform some rituals over da body.  Put Mauti down, an' den let's see what we can find out, <name>."
1424,"A Decisive Strike : It appears that these beasts in Loch Modan are following the lead of a chieftain named Grawmug. He's the biggest of all the troggs here, lurking deep within the darkness of the caves to the north.If you feel yourself worthy, <name>, I want you to lead the assassination mission on Grawmug."
1425,"Hot On the Trail: The Riverpaw Clan : Seeing as how we have no other leads, we may as well chase down the information you got.There are a couple of Riverpaw gnoll camps in the area. Track them down and search for clues. Bring back anything that you might find. Isolate your search to the Riverpaw gnolls and scouts."
1426,"Waking the Beast : Thanks to you and the Legionnaire, Nespirah has full control of her body... but most of the naga don't know this yet.  Once we make our escape, she will activate her biological defenses and destroy the naga from within.Make yourself ready... I will now tell Nespirah to begin the countdown."
1427,"Tuning the Gnomecorder : The gnomecorder looks to be in working order. I've got you all hooked up, now we just need to tune the gnomecorder for reception.Head north out of Lakeshire and follow the road up to the graveyard. Once you reach the graveyard I'll attempt to transmit."
1428,Just You and Mathias : The SI:7 are all dead. Time to find Master Mathias Shaw.Good thing the squad commander told you where he would be.
1429,"Into Occupied Territory : Now, the more direct course of action that we are going to take, to figure out what these night elves are really up to, is to have you go to their island and steal any information that you can come by.I want you to head west down the road out of town to Shalandis Isle, just off the coast. Go there and recover any plans they might have on the island or on their ship."
1430,"Attune the Bloodstone : Did you have fun fighting your way to the back of this cave?  I admit, I haven't picked the most... convenient of spots to perform my studies, especially for passing adventurers who wish to enter and leave at will.However, I can allow you to attune yourself to my bloodstone teleporters.  Simply place your hands on the stone in the back corner, and you will be teleported outside of the cave.  Then use the stone outside to teleport back!"
1431,"The Yorgen Worgen : My kinsmen at Raven Hill are concerned with curing the feral worgen in these forests. The condition itself cannot be lifted, but sanity can be restored to those not too far gone.While most here have proven beyond help, we keep an eye out for those that retain vestiges of their minds... attachments to their old lives.I've seen a lone worgen lurking the Yorgen Farmstead, digging in a pile of dirt between the buildings...could you check out that pile and see if he's left anything?"
1432,"Rest For the Weary : You have done well, <race>, but there is much more to do and I grow weary.I have expended a great deal of energy sending a distress message to Earthen Ring leadership, pleading for their help.I must rest if I am to be of further use to us here.Speak to the leader of the men you've saved and do what you can to help them prepare for battle.The naga are scouring the waters for us. It is but a matter of time before they return - and they will surely come in even greater force."
1433,Evidence Collection : The material of this bandana is identical to the material found at the Furlbrow murder scene. You should collect more red bandanas as evidence and return what you find to Captain Alpert.
1434,"Numismatics : I hate to be too cynical, but I don't think we're gonna find Nolan in one piece. Or in a lot of pieces.  Nolan was a nut for finding rare coins. He's been from one end of the world to the other finding them, and now he's gone and gotten himself killed looking for more mint condition Draenei coins. Tell you what - let me show you what these coins look like, you bring me a few more of them and I'll set up an exhibit in his honor."
1435,"Speak to Shakes : Let's not leave Captain O'Breen waiting. He'll want to see these gems first hand. After all, that's why we're here!And after a few weeks of consorting with these pirates, the professor and I have realized the last thing that's good for our health is to be caught hanging on to their treasure.Here, <name>, take these to O'Breen."
1436,"Somethin' for the Boys : Cleaned up the camp and ran errands for Forgehammer?  Not bad for a wee <class>.  Take these to Iain at Firebeard Cemetery, and he should reward you for a job well done."
1437,"The Air Strikes Must Continue : We've taken the armory from the enemy thanks to our aerial attacks against the Legion's forces in the Dead Scar.As a matter of fact, it's gone so well that we're going to continue our air strikes against them.  Take these arcane charges and use them against their forces.Talk to Ayren Cloudbreaker at the Sun's Reach Harbor when you're ready for flight."
1438,"Shadow Priest Sarvis : Are you still here, <name>?  You know, I'm only a deathguard.  I don't have many tasks I can hand out to passers-by like you.I'd recommend that you talk to Shadow Priest Sarvis.  I remember, he helped me get on my feet after I was plucked out of that tomb.  I'm sure he'll do the same for you.You'll find him just inside the chapel, here on the west side of town."
1439,"To the Depths : The Earthen Ring has identified the watery realm of Vashj'ir as a source of the adversary's destructive energies.It is still uncertain what dangers might be faced there. Any information you could gather would be of great value.The Horde is sending warships to the region as we speak. To gain passage, speak to Commander Thorak at Bladefist Bay.May the spirits guide you, <name>."
1440,"Propaganda : We've noticed a rise in violent acts amongst the homeless of the area. Something or someone is getting them all riled up. Now whoever is behind all this is getting more organized. Just recently a group of thugs came through here handing out pamphlets.Enter Moonbrook and look for evidence. Propaganda, leaflets, whatever... Bring whatever you find back to me. Maybe we can find the source through the writings."
1441,"Put It On : Hey, <name>, I've got an idea for a disguise! Take one of these merciless whatchamacallits and put it on your head.What could possibly go wrong?Ready to put it on?"
1442,"Return of the Bravo Company : I don't know who you are, <mister/missy>, but you've earned the respect and admiration of the Bravo Company. You've managed to save all our hides and kill a boatload of orcs in the process. Now we return the favor.Get back to Lakeshire and report to Colonel Troteman. We'll find Johnny and deliver the good news in person. With the Bravo Company back in action, these orcs don't stand a chance."
1443,"Plush Pelts : Hi, I'm the town merchant!  And Bronwyn's my dad!Sorry, I shouldn't get too excited.  Father says it's not professional.Anyhow, people always come to me asking for heavy leather, or rough hides, but I think they might also like it if I had some soft materials... like tiger fur!  Think you could get some for me?You'll find a few panthers nearby, but if you want to see the big tigers, you'll have to go northwest from here... north of that big troll arena."
1444,"Eye Spy : I'll be honest, <name>. That thing gives me the willy-willies. But seein' as you went to all the trouble of bringin' it here, I s'pose we ought to put it to use.You first.Peer into the eye and ask it to show you inside Cho'gall's Bastion of Twilight. We'll find out what that fat two-headed bugger is up to, and use it against him."
1445,"Night Web's Hollow : One of our greatest struggles is obtaining the natural resources we need to survive.  Gold was scarce in Lordaeron, even in the height of the Alliance's power so many years ago.There is a gold mine to the west that has been overrun with spiders.  We need gold from the mine, but we can't very well get it while the spiders are crawling around in there.  I've not much manpower to commit to the task, so we'll just have to do it little by little.Get up there and see what you can do for us, <name>."
1446,"Protecting the Shipment : We need to get this powder to Ironband, but this cart isn't going anywhere now. It'll be a lot for us to carry, and these parts can get dangerous -- and who knows what else the Dark Irons might have in store for us now that Saean is with them.I'll feel a lot better if you helped me watch over things. Miran can offload the powder kegs at camp while you and I protect the cart."
1447,"Yorla Darksnare : I've found out who's pulling the strings on this operation here. Yorla Darksnare is directing the Dark Iron dwarves from a camp to the east, and it might've been orders to have the gnolls steal Ironforge's gold in the first place.What's more, she's a wanted criminal... she's been inciting rebellion and attacks against Ironforge since Magni was still alive.She can't slip through our fingers this time, <name>. Go and get her!"
1448,"The Missing Magistrix : We sent one of our operatives to investigate the fel portal in the middle of Dawning Square, south of here.  She never returned.Take this scroll we found on one of the enemy corpses.  We believe it will grant you access through the portal.  Once through, find Magistrix Seyla and aid her in any way you can."
1449,"Defenders of Darrowshire : The battle of Darrowshire was one of the many tragedies that we humans suffered at the hands of the Scourge.  Its effects are still felt even today.Many of the town's valiant defenders now roam again as the ghastly servants of the Scourge.  We will end their misery.Hunt cannibal ghouls here within the Plaguewood.  Many of these fiends were once the good folk of Darrowshire, and destroying their forms now will set their souls free."
1450,"Two By Sea : The Forsaken catapults are kicking the snot out of us, <name>.  And even if we do take care of them, they've two ships with rows of cannons at the ready.I've a plan to kill two birds with one stone.  You're the stone in this plan.Take out the machinists manning the catapults.  After this, use the catapults to launch yourself aboard the Forsaken ships.If your aim isn't terrible, you should be able to land safely.  Once onboard, go below decks and take care of each ship's captain.  Good luck, <class>."
1451,The Battle for Hillsbrad : The journal documents the last 62 days of Clerk Horrace Whitesteed's life. In it is written damning allegations against Warden Stillwater and his activities at the Sludge Fields.You should show this to the warden. He will undoubtedly have an explanation for what is written in this journal.
1452,"Push Them Out : The people are free, but the town is still occupied by the Forsaken.  They're cut off from their main force, so if we're to drive them out, now's our chance.Their leader, Executor Cornell, is known  for his unbound ruthlessness.  Also among them is Valnov the Mad, a so-called scientist who carries out inhuman experiments on villagers too old to work the mines.Take care of them all."
1453,"Nesingwary Will Know : So da Gurubashi be on da rampage an' dey usin' serpents to lead da charge.You know who be good at keepin' da animal population in check?  Da hunters at Nesingwary's Expedition.Head over dere and see how dey doin'.  See if dey know a good way to get rid of da serpents.If dey don't know, den you gotta at least warn dem dat dese serpents, it ain't all natural."
1454,"The Sentinel's Game : As you place the statue in its place, several other stone statues appear in the room.  One more ruby-colored statue also appears, in a small enclosure on the far end of the room.  You hear a voice:  ""The Sentinel watches.  The Sentinel protects.   The Sentinel's vision never falters.""That red statue on the other side of the room looks important.  Perhaps you should try to connect the two red statues?"
1455,"The Amulet of Grol : Grol... the ogre who tore me apart.<Loramus laughs.>It would seem that Grol's body has changed hands several times since we died together, but it no longer rests with the ogres.  His body, along with his amulet of power, is in a wrecked ship off the Shattershore, to the east.  His amulet is the last... once combined, the three will give us access to Razelikh, and therein lies our chance to stop his madness."
1456,"Little Pamela : The battle for Darrowshire still haunts me, <race>.  I wake up in cold sweats, convinced that I'm still there; that it is happening all over again.I've coped with the loss of my comrades, but the loss of my family members is still cripplingly painful.  One of my kin lost during the attack was my young niece, Pamela.If you are brave enough to enter Darrowshire, will you search for any sign of Pammy?  Darrowshire's ruins are due south of here."
1457,"The Battle Resumes! : Word is in from Andorhal, <name>.  The battle has resumed.It has become somewhat well-known among the Alliance forces that you're a hero of the first battle of Andorhal.  Thassarian has requested your presence immediately."
1458,"Maliciously Delicious : You know, I've got a problem you might be able to help me out with, here.See, in addition to the fine pursuit of arms dealing, I'm trying to liven up the entertainment here in Bogpaddle. Apparently there's a bunch of these makrura things in the north waters that don't take kindly to the wild beach parties we've been throwing.Joke's on them. I'm not gonna be pushed around by giant lobsters; they're my next source of revenue! You bring me some of their tails and we'll turn a problem into profit."
1459,"The Winds of Loch Modan : Father finished the Skystrider. It's amazing! Once we get the bugs worked out, I'm going to use it to fight for justice, just like you.I know you've got to move on, and help other people, being a hero and all, but how about a ride? I'm about to take the Skystrider on its first flight, and I'll be honored if you join me. I'll drop you off at Algaz Station.What do you say?"
1460,"Incriminating Documents : The documents contain detailed maps of different strategic buildings in Eversong Woods.  A diagram of an arcane sanctum is also sketched in good detail.  There seem to be numerous notes in a language you don't recognize.As these were carried by a Darnassian spy, it might be a good idea to bring them to the Captain of the Guard - Aeldon Sunbrand."
1461,"Scourge First... Alliance Later : Darkmaster Gandling of the Cult of the Damned leads the Scourge offensive here in Andorhal.  My old counterpart, Thassarian, leads the Alliance forces.  If we're to win Andorhal, we'll have to defeat both, but we will certainly fail if we take on both at once.I know Thassarian well enough to know that he will focus on the Scourge first.  We will do the same.Take out the weaker, desiccated Scourge to reduce their numbers.  The Alliance will have to wait to taste our wrath."
1462,"Wormthorn's Dream : Not surprisingly, most of our citizens in Surwich did not come to the Blasted Lands for the pleasant atmosphere.  They came following the dream of an idealistic druid: Marl Wormthorn.  Wormthorn believed that the Tainted Scar could be healed, and attempted to grow it back.It looks like he was wrong.  He grew his forest, but the land is still plagued by demons, and his great-tree is twisted and gnarled.I'm still hopeful.  Maybe if we head into the Tainted Forest and clear out some of the taint..."
1463,"Val'kyr Incursion : The val'kyr were one of the Scourge's primary weapons.  Not only were they skilled in battle, but they could be used to convert corpses into Scourge minions.  To think that Sylvanas is stooping to such levels for the sake of the Forsaken...We need to stop the val'kyr before they wipe us out and turn our army against us.  Slay as many as you can find.  And bring some of these minutemen with you.  If they've survived this long, then they must have some battle skill."
1464,"Ol' Blasty : We've got some work to do.  How much experience have you got with cannons?  Hmm... really?  Well, how about with ancient, fallin'-apart pirate cannons?We've got a few cannons updecks that work the old-fashioned way: you load one cannonball in at a time, aim, lock it into place, and fire.  Works well if you're tryin' to hit the side of a three-sailer... not so well for rowboats and the like.Why don't you head upstairs and lob a few shots at Smilin' Timmy Sticks?"
1465,
1466,"Coastal Delicacies! : My spiders are hungry and agitated! They haven't eaten for days and are starting to sample our human captives. We can't have that. We need those humans for use in the Sludge Fields.I want you to take one of my hungry mine spiders out and feed it murlocs from the Western Strand, south of here. Whatever you kill, it'll eat! The more the better!"
1467,"In Defense of the King's Lands : We need to protect the Loch, <name>! With so many of the King's soldiers fighting valiantly on remote battlefields, we've become overwhelmed on the home front. Troggs are tunneling up from every crevice! The trogg infestation poses the largest threat to Ironforge.We need you, brave adventurer, to venture forth and lay waste to the trogg threat. Slay twelve Stonesplinter troggs and venture back."
1468,"On to Kharanos : Some of the mountaineers under Stonegrind's command were telling me about the situation out at Kharanos. When the troggs took over Frostmane Hold, it sounds like the surviving trolls fled westward, deep into the heart of the dwarven homeland.Now, they threaten the dwarven town of Kharanos. It sounds like they're going to need all the help they can get. You should go to Kharanos and introduce yourself to Captain Tharran. Just follow the road east out of Brewnall and keep going until you see the town."
1469,"SI:7 Drop : Mathias Shaw and the SI:7 are here to assist us with operations up top in the Twilight Citadel. I need you to escort them there.The Wildhammer are being kind enough to give us a lift in. The agents have some things that they need to do down in the Twilight Gate area first, though.Speak with Angus Stillmountain and get yourself a squad to drop off. You'll fly them in. A big blue X marks the spot."
1470,"No Escape : You must strike at their leaders, <name>. You will find them holed up in the old keep. Battle your way inside and find the holdouts! Turn them for your queen!None shall escape the mighty grasp of the Forsaken!"
1471,"Ace in the Hole : You have no idea how difficult it was to stay disguised while I watched Koltira let this war slip away from us.  Even now, those infernal farmers threaten to overwhelm us.  All because he refused to slay a friend.Take my val'kyr again, <name>.  With her by your side, kill these farmers, convert them to Forsaken, and mobilize them.  Then take a group of them into Alliance-held western Andorhal and hunt down this death knight, Thassarian.We will win this war yet."
1472,"Mukla's Demise : <name>, I now put my faith in you to help free me.  The great Skymane King Mukla is my captor.  He commands the beasts of this island, and they keep me here against my will with the aid of this chain.  If you can slay him and find the key to this shackle, I shall be indebted to you greatly.I often hear him to the southeast side of the island, but please be careful: he is not to be trifled with."
1473,"The Corpsebeasts : To the south, gutless cultists are focused on a grim task: re-animating enormous hunks of flesh, to create giants known as corpsebeasts.  Luckily for us, these giants are still lifeless and weak.Take this charm - using it will place a font of holy energy on the ground.  If you can manage to place three of them near one of the corpsebeasts that the cultists are reanimating, the holy energy should overload it, destroying its body forever."
1474,"The Baroness' Missive : The note is from Baroness Anastari, and it describes a ritual that is about to happen in the Plaguewood's central slaughterhouse - just south of where Tarenar is at.  This could be where they're holding Gidwin!Tarenar will want to know about this... and quickly, before it's too late!"
1475,"A Lashtail Hatchling : Upon dealing the final blow to the lashtail eggs, you look down to see a newborn hatchling looking back up at you.  You can see it studying you, learning your features and following your movements.The lashtail hatchling has formed a bond with you.Your original assignment was to thin out the raptors, but you have fulfilled your egg quota, and this one is an innocent newborn.  Perhaps someone back at Grom'gol Base Camp will know what to do with a raptor hatchling."
1476,"Sacred to the Bloodscalp : Ahh... these must be names of their totemic creatures - the animals that they attribute to the spirits.  Let's see... Mahamba as water, Tsul'Kalu as earth, Pogeyan as... air?  Fire?  I can't make this part out.I'd like some more information on these spirits of theirs.  The Bloodscalp have a camp close to here, in the Tkashi ruins.  Maybe you can find some details there."
1477,"Aiming High : Lookie here, <name>. I found the biggest gun in Highbank! We're gonna try a technique handed down ta me by my pappy, from his pappy, from his pappy, shortly before he got blowed up.It's called the ""<class>-shot.""You take a <race> <class>, and load <him/her> inta a gigantic cannon, and then ya - oh relax. This usually works.Take these explosives, then wait here next ta me. As soon as that blimpy comes around I'll blast you onto tha deck. Plant the explosives in 'er belly and, oh I dunno, make it up as you go."
1478,"Odor Coater : Marvelous creation if I do say so myself. Ready for deployment.Simply spray the clam divers with a bit of the chemical and they shall soon be accompanied by a protective aquatic companion. You can even spray yourself to similar effect if you so desire.Speaking of desire, I would highly recommend that you moderate deployment of the chemical attractor to minimal applications. Large doses could result in undesirable effects...Undesirable for you anyway. Likely very desirable for the fish.Away!"
1479,"The Prison Rooftop : I don't understand why the king wants to waste time saving his hide, but if you want to risk your life, then be my guest.Crowley and his men are holed up upstairs, probably plotting against the king as we speak!"
1480,"The Maw of Iso'rath : We are ready to attack the beast. First, we need to destroy it's tentacles, then Yevaa will perform a ritual to summon a powerful fire elemental that we will drop into its maw.I want you to fly out with our first group attack. Hold steady until an opportunity presents itself, then join the battle with the rest of the shaman in cutting the tentacles down.Take any one of the gryphons when you're ready to join the assault."
1481,"Unstable Mana Crystals : A group of Wretched recently raided a supply of unstable mana crystals from one of our arcane sanctums.  If not handled properly, the crystals could explode with enough force to blow a hole into the city walls.Now, <name>, I don't quite care if they blow themselves up while tapping unstable arcane sources, but the whole incident would make my men look bad.Bring me back any remaining stolen crystals you find; they might still be inside their original crates."
1482,"Pelt Collection : The springpaw that inhabit this region are known for their high quality pelts.  We've even seen night elf scum travel to these lands just to poach them.Our skirmishes with the Amani have put a bit of a strain on our supply of gear and our rangers don't have much time to hunt for pelts anymore.  If you'd be willing to lend a hand by collecting springpaw pelts, I'd be happy to reward you with a hand-crafted piece of armor.  You'll find springpaw stalkers all around the woods north of here."
1483,War Machines : Dried-up Scourge... weak.  Abominations... strong.We defeat strong abominations... we win war.
1484,Runestones of Binding : ON THE OTHER... SIDE OF... MY CHAMBER THERE... ARE... CANDIDATES FOR ASCENSION.WE WILL NEED... THEIR... RUNESTONES OF BINDING... TO CREATE A... MEANS OF CONTROLLING... A BOUND ELEMENTAL.
1485,"High Priestess Jeklik : Ahead of you looms a ramp up to one of the city's many terraces.  The bat-shaped totems ahead of you indicate that this is the domain of High Priestess Jeklik, a follower of Hir'eek.Jeklik was one of the Hakkar-worshipping priests that Zanzil was planning to resurrect.  Perhaps if you hurry, you can stop the resurrection!"
1486,"Worth Its Weight in Gold : Archmage Malin sent me here to collect reagents for him. I was at a loss as to how I was going to collect the items, but now that you're here, I think my problem's solved.I need Witherbark tusks and Witherbark medicine pouches.Could you find those for me? The Witherbark live to the southeast of Arathi."
1487,"Drowned Sorrows : Argh, 'tis a horrible life. I should be in a watery grave right now, not sittin' here by the fire, breathin' fresh air.The crew tried so hard to save my beautiful Maiden's Folly. Bless the boys, bless their hearts.O'Breen made it to shore safely but we weren't so lucky. The seas just sank on us, I swear.One second we're afloat and the next water is rushin' in. And those beasts! Killed all the survivors. Horrible naga scum. I went black and ended up here, saved.I want those beasts dead."
1488,"Caught Off-Guard : Our escape from the shell can't have gone unnoticed, but either the naga at these ruins weren't informed or they don't consider us a threat. I don't intend to take the opportunity for granted - we strike now.I need you to slip into the lower level of the ruins to our west and take out as many of their patrols as you can. We cannot risk any of those patrols finding out about our occupation of this cave - make sure none escape."
1489,"Author! Author! : We've reviewed the tome recovered from Karazhan. Though we found references to the Pillars of Creation, one piece of crucial information was omitted from the book... where to find the artifacts.Fortunately, we have access to an expert on the subject.The author, Alodi, was the first Guardian of Tirisfal. His spirit is forever bound to the Forge of the Guardian, which has been hidden in our safekeeping. I think the time has come to call him forth."
1490,"Salvage Operation : Between the Horde and the naga, our fleet has been decimated. We can't do anything to bring back the men who gave their lives to the sea, but sink me if I allow all of our supplies to be lost forever.Swim out to the Obsidian Breakers southwest of Highbank and retrieve our supplies from the wrecks and the ocean floor."
1491,"Forcible Acquisition : I've got a little proposition for you, if you're interested.The Dark Iron dwarves were here long before we arrived.  That means that, once these titan ruins opened up, the Dark Irons were the first ones in there, looting all the choice items.  I'll bet they've still got those treasures locked up inside Angor Fortress, northwest of here.I want you to find such a treasure... then steal it."
1492,"Our Fallen Friends : Based on what you're telling me, it sounds like there aren't many survivors... just restless spirits.  The least we can do is give them their rest.<Enohar takes a long draw off of a mug of black ale.>Head back to the Shattershore and vanquish the worgen ghosts that still remain.  Doing so should release their spirit from this world and allow them to pass into the next."
1493,"In Time, All Will Be Revealed : The Dark Lady has sent you and Arthura here for a very specific purpose. Before I tell you more, we must make preparations.Head east into the forest of Gilneas and search near the trees and rocks of the region for a special plant known as wolfsbane. Gather as much of the wolfsbane as you can carry and return to me.Our mission here goes far beyond the scope of the battlefield, <name>. In time, all will be revealed."
1494,"Parting Packages : I'm sure Patch has some grand scheme in mind, but this wouldn't be an assault if we didn't leave some explosive presents behind.Get down there and plant some of these explosives on the boat, in the keep entrance, and in one of those northern towers. That should be enough to leave them reeling.We're heading down to the ground as well. Meet us at the eastern tower when you're through."
1495,"Dah, Nunt... Dah, Nunt... : So, seein' as ya been so kind to me, I'm inclined to let you in on a special secret.I've found the biggest shiney of all, no more than 50 steps from where we're standin'!Only one thing stands between you, me, and great fortune - and his name is Gnaws.Don't fret now - I've got a plan.Gnaws loves his grubs, so I've loaded one up with that gunpowder so as to make like a trap of sorts, ya see?Just set it floatin' up in the reef. Once the shark is dead, we're rich!"
1496,"A Closer Look : We've seen countless ships sail past the shore to the southeast, but most pass by inconspicuously.  Several days ago, however, a powerful storm carried several of the ships to shore and left them wrecked.I'd bet a pint of Nethergarde Bitter that they were Horde ships if I didn't love Nethergarde Bitter so much.  I can pay you gold, though, if you'll go check out those ships and report back."
1497,"Tiger Hunting : When I was but a young girl, my father trained me in the art of tiger hunting.You'll find the young felines much easier to track and slay.  One can often find young tigers near the expedition camp.Test your tracking skills and see if you can hunt some of the beasts down.  Start your hunt near our camp, to the south."
1498,"Step One: The Priestess : My brethren are being butchered here. It's as I thought.I must ask your help further before I enter, <name>. In the passageway outside this room, the hallway proceeds left and right. To the right, it goes down to the Chamber of Blood. Here the Atal'ai perform their dark rituals.They have expected and prepared for my kind for years, but not for you. Enter the Chamber of Blood and slay the Priestess Udum'bra. She is one of three foul presences here that must be vanquished before I may enter."
1499,"Discover Rolf's Fate : Upon further searching the area, you find webbed footprints leading east along the shore of Stone Cairn Lake.  In the distance to the east, you can just barely see a Murloc village.Perhaps Rolf's fate ended there..."
1500,"Yowler Must Die! : <The gnomecorder hums.>You need to find Yowler, <name>. He'll be located somewhere in the northern region of Redridge Canyons. Kill that mongrel and search his corpse for the Blackrock invasion plans. Should you succeed, bring the plans to me over at the town hall in Lakeshire.Solomon, out."
1501,"Zen'Kiki, the Druid : I am Adrine Towhide, a druid of the Cenarion Circle.  You can thank us for healing this land, where once there was only death.We accept all who choose to follow the druidic path, regardless of race, faction, or talent.  Occasionally that means we enlist a druid who needs more help than others.I'd like you to meet Zen'Kiki.  He's pretty new, and he's still learning his craft.  Would you mind taking him out with you for a while?  You can practice combat on the plagued animals that roam nearby."
1502,"Striking Back : My chief engineer tells me that he's managed to get one of the bombers repaired and airworthy. Take these bombs with you, and look for the repaired bomber at the start of the runway.Once you're airborne, use the bombs to do as much damage to the attacking Dark Iron dwarves as you can. I've heard rumors that they're preparing to deploy a new kind of war golem. Keep your eyes peeled for those golems and make them your highest priority targets."
1503,"Fuselight, Ho! : Hey, <race>, listen up.  I got a job opportunity that you aren't gonna want to miss out on.We been sent up here from Fuselight, a new goblin town way down in the Badlands.  Lots of money to be had down there, yes <sir/ma'am>.  And not nearly so many zombies... or uptight Argent paladin-types.Nope, it's an untamed wilderness down there, and we're looking for someone like you to help us tame it.  Whenever you're ready... we'll be waiting."
1504,"Protect the Frontier : Hail, <name>.  Wild animals are growing more and more aggressive the farther we get from Goldshire, and the Eastvale Logging Camp suffers nearly constant attacks from wolves and bears!We could use your help out here."
1505,"The Warden's Pawn : Once those Reliquary honks got here, we panicked, and we all just started looting indiscriminately.A lot of bad archaeology happened that day.Luckily, Olga happened upon this small jade statue.  We thought it to be a key of some sort, but can't figure out what it opens.  Maybe you'll have some better luck with it."
1506,"Lordaeron : Ride with me to the Sepulcher, <name>. There are many things I wish to discuss with you. It is imperative that you understand the history of Lordaeron and the plight of the Forsaken."
1507,"Sigil of Strom : In ancient times, Lord Ignaeus of Strom, named Trollbane, led the first human civilization of Arathor in war against the trolls. His blade was Trol'kalar--troll slayer, in their ancient tongue.I was one of the last of his line, sworn with guarding Trol'kalar...a duty in which I failed. But now, we will obtain it once more, for my new master.The sword is bound by three sigils. The first is held by the Syndicate traitors that lurk the ruins of Stromgarde. Slay them, and return the sigil to me."
1508,"Crushblow : You've more than proved your intent and your abilities. With Grim Batol cut off and the black dragons routed, the Twilight's Hammer are cornered in their Citadel.Go to your leaders. You should find them west, at Crushblow. Let them know that when the attack on the Twilight Citadel begins, the red flight shall fill the skies above. You may not be able to atone for all of the sins your allies have committed, but in this one battle, we shall be by your side.The Twilight's Hammer will fall."
1509,"The Spoils of War : We've toppled a giant today, <name>.  While the Blackrock orcs still swarm in their spire, I doubt their plans will take them anywhere near Redridge anytime soon.  You and Keeshan saw to that.I'd say we were fairly resourceful here in Burning Steppes - those warlock supplies we collected certainly came in handy, as did the obsidian ash that we used to conceal our dragon.There were, however, some collected items left over.  Please, take your pick before you move on, beyond the steppes."
1510,"Felendren the Banished : A betrayer of our people resides atop Falthrien Academy to the southwest.Felendren is his name, and he was banished from blood elf lands for failing to heed the warnings of our teachers and elders.  He is the worst of our society, as he lives only to feed his insatiable magical addictions.  He refused to learn control; he is a shell of his former self - one of the Wretched - and he is a threat to the Sunspire.Destroy him and the wraiths he uses as minions."
1511,"Still Assessing the Threat : Damned worthless gnolls are up to no good. I can feel it in my bones. Gnoll activity in the area has tripled in the past two weeks. I fear they might be mounting up to make an assault on Lakeshire.I need you to head to each of the gnoll camps of this area and gather any information that you come across. Check the camps directly north of here, east of here and southeast of here. Bring back whatever you find."
1512,"Coup de Grace : Look at that. Lirastrasza's destroying them!There are drakes that she's downing that need finishing off, <name>. Wouldn't want the Twilight's healers to get them back up into the air.Time for a little Coup de Grace."
1513,"The Princess Unleashed : Myzrael is a deceiver. She is an ancient force sealed long ago, and must be kept that way.You must confront her at the Shards of Myzrael where you first spoke with her.  Summon her with this scroll, and when she has been fully brought to the surface, defeat her. Then take the Eldritch Shackles from her body and place them on the Shards to keep her fully bound once more.Good luck, <name>... may my past trouble you no more."
1514,"Enough Damage For One Day : We do not have any further strategic need for Thorg'izog or the Blackrock ground troops.  We must continue to the next phase of the plan.When you are finished at the stronghold, return to us here in Chiselgrip."
1515,"Operation: Stir the Cauldron : I'm putting you on a flying machine, <name>.You'll be responsible for softening our landing into the slag pit.  Speak with your flight master here in Thorium Point, then fly down to the gorge.Once you near your landing point, there will undoubtedly be hordes of Dark Iron dwarves waiting for you.  Use our flying machine's guns to take out as many of them as you can, then land at the cavern's entrance.  Rendan should be waiting for you by the time you arrive."
1516,"Torn Ground : It won't be takin' much convincin' to turn us against da Twilight - dat's already our goal. We've already come to battle here though, so we may be needin' ya help before we can turn towards dere fortress.Da Twilight have already brought Iso'rath up from da ground to the south, I'm sure ya noticed. Its tentacles have been burstin' from da ground all around us. We could use a hand beatin' them down if you be willin'."
1517,"Gargal, the Behemoth : You may not have noticed, but I'm pretty big, as far as orcs go.I make sure that my two pals here don't get into too much trouble.  They're small, and they don't have a big shield like me.  I'm big, and I can handle a few monsters hitting me!  Plus, if I'm careful, I can usually get them to hit my shield instead!I can protect you, too.  Come on, let's go practice for a bit.  I'll make sure the enemies attack me, and not you."
1518,"Home... Gone... Naga... : <The murloc struggles to speak your language.>Rockpool... attacked.  Naga turn, take village, villagers.Salt-Flop escape, but others do not.  Go south, talk to Chief Neptool.  Maybe he survive."
1519,"Just Like Old Times : It's funny. Kin and I have been through so much together, and here we find ourselves back in Arathi, like so many years ago.We broke up a plot to create a new plague right here, her and I. It doesn't look like the Horde learned their lesson, because they're all over this farm yet again.Their undead courier is shuffling around as obvious as daylight. If you want to help, find the courier and bring back whatever they're carrying."
1520,"The Hammer of Twilight : While you were in the mine, I was able to figure out where the Hammer of Twilight is being kept. They created it at the Altar of Twilight to the south.More important than that, the cultists have made a critical error: Cho'gall is personally overseeing its final construction.<Garona begins sharpening her blades.>Many Kor'kron died to bring us this information."
1521,"Paint it Black : The ground bleeds, <class>. They tear it open, as one would gouge flesh.These cultists relish their secrecy but the very elementals they use for their misdeeds can betray them. Seek out Obsidian Stoneslaves northeast of here, among the ruined earth we have named the Black Breach.Shatter their bodies and find for me a perfect heart of black diamond. I will look into this heart. And I will bare its soul."
1522,"Know Your Ley Lines : Freeloaders!You all want instant gratification - never giving thought to the effort required to create even the simplest of portals.Perhaps a little education will instill a bit of gratitude for my ceaseless efforts.Take this crystal. Attune it to the Bloodcrystal to the west, at the Dawning Square portal just south of here, and at the naga shrine at Greengill Coast to the southeast.Perhaps then you'll appreciate your precious translocations...."
1523,"The Hunter's Revenge : The beast that's been hunting us... I've been hunting it.We call him Mauti.  He's a clever one.  But he made a grave mistake when he killed my brother.  Now that mistake is going to cost him.  Ol' Direhammer has got his scent.I've noticed him roaming just above Kurzen's Compound.  If we act fast, we can take him down.Are you ready, <name>?"
1524,"Transdimensional Warfare: Chapter II : <The Banshee Queen's words float in your head.>You are now ready to use the portal. Be warned, <name>, once you step through you will appear in another dimension at Ambermill. There will be a hundred, perhaps a thousand, magi waiting to kill you.You must persevere and kill all in your path."
1525,"I Am the Law and I Am the Lash : I've been looking for a good, strong soldier like you.  I need someone to keep my troops in line.Outside the stronghold, you will find orcs, ogres, and trolls preparing for the assault on Redridge.  My sergeants keep them in line, but I'd like you to assist them.Take this cudgel and discipline a few of my soldiers.  I don't care if they're misbehaving or standing perfectly in line, I want them beaten.  I want them focused, battle-hardened, and obedient.Now go."
1526,"Across the Great Divide : We will need to press deeper into Vashj'ir if we want to uncover what the naga are doing here.Go to the Lightless Reaches, the giant chasm bordering the Kelp'thar Forest to the west.  If you look across it, you should see a cluster of plant-life surrounding the entrance to Damplight Chamber.Once you're inside the cave, it's a bit of a ride up until you break surface, but I have friends there that should provide you a warm welcome."
1527,Lost Necklace : I lost my necklace and I think that guttersnipe Billy Maclure took it!  He's usually scuttling like a rat around the Maclure Vineyards east of here. Get my necklace back for me and you'll warm an old widow's heart.
1528,"At War With The Scarlet Crusade : Though the strength of the Scarlet Crusade wanes, we are still at war.  The report Executor Arren sent me indicates Scarlet Crusaders have been raiding from the ruined tower in southeastern Tirisfal near the Balnir Farmstead under the command of Captain Vachon.Kill 3 of his zealots and 4 of his friars. It should prove to be a devastating blow to the Crusade!"
1529,"A Lure : Stick this device on your head, then swim through the kelp and coral along the canyon's edge.  There should be all kinds of little fish in there that find your new antenna irresistible.When we return to Darkbreak Cove, we'll have armfuls of fish for everyone!"
1530,"Greasing the Wheel : Sorry about that.  I was pretty sure you were one of those spider-beasts, doing a bad <race> impression.How do you do?  Gidwin Goldbraids, at your service.  I'm in a bit of a hurry back to my caravan, but I was wondering if you might do me one last favor?  My pal Fiona runs a small shop, and she could probably use some of these herbs that grow along the river shore.I'm thinking if we give her some nice herbs, she'll be MUCH less likely to murder me.  That's the plan, anyway."
1531,"The Demons and the Druid : The Reliquary is focused on the acquisition and preservation of magical artifacts.  Our particular excursion is focused on the demonic artifacts that are hidden in what used to be the Tainted Scar.A worgen druid has taken residence in the scar and is coaxing a forest to grow.  He seems to be failing, however, as the area is still infested with demons.Anyhow, his forest stands in the way of our excursion, as do these demons.  Slay the tainted ones, then return to me so we might deal with the druid."
1532,"The Final Ritual : The knife is ready.  Loramus is present, and he knows what he must do.  I must now take the three amulets and use their enchantment to grant you access to Razelikh, the amulets' creator.I am prepared to perform the ritual on you and Loramus.  Speak with me when you are both ready."
1533,"Lady La-La's Medallion : Dozens of crude gold links make up this heavy chain.Dangling from the center link is an opalescent fragment of what must have once been a large shell-shaped medallion.You wonder if the other fragments might be nearby, and if the medallion might be reassembled into its original state."
1534,"Fenbush Berries : We're good on provisions, but we're in need of some medicine. Half the camp's fiercely hung over, and a remedy's in order.Luckily, I know a good folk remedy taught to me by my dear old mum. We just need some local ingredients.Gather me some fenbush berries, if you would. They keep to where there's water and shade, so look along the shore and near other plants."
1535,"First Sample: Wild Eggs : I am experimenting with black dragons.  Specifically, I am interested in how they procreate.My current experiments require plenty of black dragon eggs, which is why I am here in Lethlor Ravine.  I'd gather the eggs myself, but I think you'll benefit from helping me out.You will find them along the edges of the ravine.  Beware the guardians that circle above - they do not appreciate stolen eggs."
1536,Communing with the Ancient : Place the dead merciless one upon your head to pose as one of their slaves.Enter L'ghorek. Commune with the ancient.
1537,Arena Master : There must be more to being a master of the arena than this!  Perhaps the Pirate who runs the event at Gurubashi will know!
1538,"Sinking From Within : The attack on Booty Bay is looming.  You'll have to return to Booty Bay quickly and inform the Baron.First, however, it might be a good idea to sabotage some of the pirates' supplies while you're still in their favor.  The pirates keep most of their supplies belowdecks, spread out across the entire fleet."
1539,"Pressing Forward : Good work so far. We should find the entrance to Grim Batol just past the next gate.I was ordered to secure the entrance and block off reinforcements while the rest of our men press through the path we've cleared up the canyon. I'm thinking if we get there soon enough, maybe I can let Ticker have a little more fun.Let's get moving down the canyon to the southwest - we should find the next gate pretty quickly."
1540,"A Lost Lad : It was only yesterday that I sent him out to investigate the farm directly east of here, but it feels like an eternity has passed!  True perfection. The way his blond locks framed his perfect blood elf face... Such strength. I didn't want to send him away, but he insisted! How could I refuse him?  Alas, poor Johnny Awesome has not returned! I fear the worst, <name>. Find him!"
1541,"Totem Modification : Okay, I'll let you in on the real work, since you're looking at me so desperately.This rock is untapped! It's probably richer than a trade prince during a great war! I need samples. More samples. Samples from everywhere!I've modified my earth totems to drill through the sand and store samples of the rock underneath. Go find a nice spot and plant one.The shaking and rumbling will probably attract all the cute, curious wildlife, so maybe you can make some friends while you're at it."
1542,"Rundown : They're getting away!These are the same naga that attacked the boats and carried away our friends. We cannot let them escape!Take these spears and run them down with that seahorse of yours... don't waste your time dismounting, just keep after them and kill all that you can with the spears.I will try to hunt down that Fathom-Lord. Meet me at the far end of the ledge when you're done."
1543,"Come Hell or High Water : Oh fer the love of...I know our survivor friend here means well, but the lad's been severely traumatized.There only be one way ta deal with these accursed beasts, an' that be a fine dwarven axe buried hilt-deep in the noggin.Pile up enough o' their corpses an' they'll think twice before fiddlin' with yer tasty bits.Mark me words <laddie/lassie>, them buggers don't like the sight o' their own blood any more than you or I.Now git out there an' give 'em what fer!"
1544,"Traveling on Our Stomachs : I'll need your help if I am to get these men ready for battle.Any decent leader knows that his men travel and fight on their stomachs. No food, no victory.These soldiers are weak from their recent ordeal. They'll need sustenance if they're to put up any kind of fight when the need arises.Speaking of traveling on stomachs, I've seen several crabs out there on the sea floor...."
1545,"Dalar Dawnweaver : Take the codex and travel north to the Sepulcher. Once there, find Dalar Dawnweaver. Dalar is a former archmage of the Kirin Tor. Surely he will be able to bring down the protective wards surrounding this codex and pry its secrets loose.Hurry, <name>."
1546,"A Steady Supply : Hey bud. Seeing as how you're so friendly and great and all, think you might do a dwarf a favor?These are Dunwald ruins... there's SURE to be more stock in some of these buildings. If you come upon more ale, bring it my way, will ya? A good dwarf can never have enough!I'm thinkin' I'll find my way back to Keely, so ya might have to hunt me down, but I'll try'n make it worth it to ya."
1547,"Do it for Twinkles : Warden Stillwater sent me out into the field to investigate the outbreak. When I arrived, Twinkles and I were charged by the lumbering monstrosity known as Verringtan. I was knocked off of Twinkles and immediately ran for my life. Twinkles, though, stayed behind and fought the beast off. Alas, she was defeated and then summarily planted in the soil as if she were some type of glorious star pony seedling.She gave her life to defend me. Vengeance must be mine! If for nothing else, do it for Twinkles!"
1548,"Corrupted Soil : This was a fully functional arcane sanctum before Arthas and his army of Scourge decided to plow through it on their way to Silvermoon.Now it's as useful to us as any part of the Dead Scar.  The soil is tainted, undead are drawn to it and the energy in the ley lines is completely disrupted.What I want to know, <name>, is whether this taint is reversible or not.  I want you to collect soil samples from this area so I can study them.  Perhaps with time we can set things back to normal."
1549,"The Farstrider Enclave : Magisters and Farstriders may not see eye to eye all the time, <name>.  When it comes to Dar'Khan, however, we're all in agreement that a way must be found to defeat him and his legions.Ranger Vynna, at the Farstrider Enclave northeast of here, has come across important information regarding our enemy.  Speak to her and see if you can be of assistance."
1550,"The Downfall of Marl Wormthorn : Wormthorn's unnatural forest threatens our excursion's progress.  His trees' roots break our picks, his moss grows over our excavation sites, and his animals attack my men.  When it comes to digging, I'll take a demon-infested wasteland over a forest any day.Take the demoniac vessel and use it on Marl Wormthorn to pull him from his trance.  Return to me when he is no more."
1551,"Hero's Call: Blasted Lands! : By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Quartermaster Lungertz at Nethergarde Keep.Nethergarde's garrison urgently needs your help to stem the Horde advance into the Blasted Lands! Travel south from the Swamp of Sorrows and follow the road east to reach Nethergarde Keep.For the glory and honor of the Alliance!"
1552,"A Bone to Pick : We did it!Gnaws is down, and I have our shiney!That's good news.Darn shiney is cursed treasure - makes everyone who touches it a skeleton.That's bad news.These cursed pirates say the Gilblin King has the secret to remove the hex.That's good news.I can't step foot outside the reef or I'll be cursed forever.That's bad news."
1553,Insurrection : First Arcanist Thalyssra has received dark tidings regarding the Nightfallen rebellion and requires your assistance.Journey to Shal'Aran in Suramar and meet with her.
1554,Nightmare : Iso'rath's brain is revealed! The shaman you've saved should keep you somewhat safe amidst his defenses.Strike at the brain and destroy Iso'rath!
1555,"Seek and Destroy : <The Banshee Queen's voice invades your thoughts once more.>Search the nearby farmhouses for Alliance stragglers. Keep an eye out for any information that could lead us to Crowley and Bloodfang. Seek and destroy all that would stand in your way, <name>!"
1556,"Excelsior : With the inside finished, all that's left is to add the outer layer. For this, I use only the best elder croc skins. They are more durable and a better canvas--if you will--for adding the designs and accents that make Drizzlik's Excelsior line.It's hard to find that perfect skin though, the only one that fits my plan is the skin of an elder snapjaw crocolisk.  Find them to the south, near the border with the cape."
1557,"Wolves at Our Heels : The dire wolves are the most common threat to the townsfolk here. They lurk in the forests on all sides of us, though most are along the north bank of the river.These aren't the runt dogs you see in Elwynn, or wherever you come from. They're big as a man and twice as vicious.If you wish to assist the people of Darkshire, hunt the dire wolves so our streets can be safer."
1558,"The Night Watch : I'm afraid you're all I've got to help here, <name>. Stormwind's forces are so taxed by greater evils that they can't spare a single footman to protect Darkshire. It's up to me and the rest of the Night Watch to keep our homes safe.There's more threats here than just wolves, unfortunately. Rotting horrors roam near Blind Mary's Haunt, on the southeast outskirts. If they're not kept in check, they'll be visiting our homes in the night.Deal with the undead and report back to me for your bounty."
1559,"Hook 'em High : The Wildhammer can train war gryphons faster than we can subvert and control drakes. We can't let them continue to outnumber us!Hunt gryphon riders flying over the river north of Bloodgulch. Take this hook and fling it at them as they fly by. Their momentum will hurl them from their mount, right to your feet. Kill the dismounted gryphon riders!"
1560,"Securing the Beach Head : Something troubles me, <name>. The Twilight dragons knew just where and when to strike our airfleet. It's as if they knew our plans.Twilight spies cower within our midst!I'm going to take one of our remaining ships back to Orgrimmar to roll some heads. I need you to stay behind and secure this front. The Dragonmaw shaman are powerful; I have asked them to open up a portal to Orgrimmar, and I need you to help.So. Start helping!"
1561,"Me Brother, Nipsy : Me brother, Nipsy, runs a rat kabob operation on the other side of Deeprun. Ye needs to take this here crate o' rats to him before they go bad. Get a move on!Ye have ridden a tram before, aye? It's easy. Just step aboard when she arrives and enjoy the ride. An' keep yer arms and legs inside durin' the ride, lest ye be peglegged fer life."
1562,"Dangerous Intentions : Do you know why Mortuus appends 'nub' to your name, <name>? Because he is an incompetent sycophant that has trouble seeing through his oversized helmet. 'NUB' is your classification. You are now part of the NEW UNDERCITY BATALLION.But enough with the comedy! I sent Deathstalker Yorick on a shadow operation two days ago. Her goal was to get information on the Gilneas Liberation Front and return. Three days and no word from her.Head southwest to the Ivar Patch and look for Yorick, <name>."
1563,"Devastation : The coast is clear.  If Rheastrasza or the egg were able to miraculously evade Deathwing's flames, they would probably need your assistance as soon as possible."
1564,"Protecting Her Royal Highness Poobah : These vicious jungle cats have been circling me for some time now.  I watch them as closely as I can, but they seem to just... disappear into the grass.How they snarl and hiss!Don't get me wrong... I still want you to rescue me, but first, clear out some of these cats.  I won't need to be rescued if I end up someone's dinner."
1565,"Bloodsail Treachery : The map shows Booty Bay with a red ""X"" drawn precisely at the spot at which you are standing.The scribbled text reads:""Set up your command post here, and bide your time.  The Fleet Master will send out word when it's time to make your move.""""I'm placing Lieutenant Bruce in charge here.  This time will be different.  This time we take Booty Bay once and for all.""The map is held in place with a dagger, placed right through the location of Booty Bay."
1566,"Personal Request : Shame about the Doyles. It's a fair miracle that as many of us made it out as is though, so can't count it as much of a surprise.Those louts at Thundermar are cowards. Even after tellin' them it was Keegan askin', they won't set foot outside of their town. I did rope in the Moores though, so that's at least three clans' worth.Keegan wanted to hear from ya personally when you returned. Go find'm in town."
1567,"Maywiki : <Linzi looks troubled.>You know, there's a troll hiding behind that pile of boxes.  She must be awfully sad, if she doesn't want to come out and talk to anyone.<Linzi places some of the Akiris reeds in a kerchief and ties it together.>Here, give these to her.  They're very soft, and that maybe they will make her feel a little more comfortable back there."
1568,"Priestess Thaalia : Thank you, <name>.  I know you didn't have to save my life.The return of Bloodlord Mandokir is ill news.  He was killed inside Zul'Gurub several years ago, and we thought we had seen the last of him and his kind.  The trolls of Zul'Gurub were attempting to perform a hideous, horrible ritual.  If Mandokir is alive, then it stands to reason that he is not the only one.The explorers at Fort Livingston, far to the south, may know more.  Speak with their priestess."
1569,"Glory Amidst Chaos : You and my son are going back to that mountain.  There's three orcs who survived the attack, and we won't rest until they're dead.That's right, I'm talking about the Big Three.General Thorg'izog crawled back into the Firegut Furnace, and Dragon-Lord Neeralak is cowering in the cave on the mountain's peak.  Xi'lun is in the back of the Skull Warren, plotting with his fellow warlocks.Leave your mark, <name>.  Topple these corrupt Blackrock orcs once and for all."
1570,"Lifting the Curse : To break the curse, there must be a reckoning. Captain Halyndor damned us all to covet a forbidden artifact; the Eye of Paleth. His spirit still covets it, standing guard over the strongbox of his old ship, the Intrepid.Vanquish the soul of the one who cursed us so, <class>. Defeat the Captain, claim his key, and spirit the Eye of Paleth far from this place."
1571,"A Bundle of Trouble : I've got a real problem on my hands. I have a deadline looming for an order of lumber, and I'm running out of time. The wolves and bears north of here have chased my workers away from the bundles of wood that they've already chopped.I've already talked to Deputy Rainer about clearing the animals, but I need someone to go collect the wood for me. If you could collect eight bundles of wood for me I might just make my deadline."
1572,"Iterating Upon Success : The concoction is finally ready, but before I can put my seal of approval on this strain, we'll need to run a field test.Speak to Bat Handler Maggotbreath, here at High Command, and requisition a bat. The bat will take you to the Dawning Isles, east of here across Lordamere Lake, right into the heart of depravity itself - the Vile Fin murloc dens!Use the concoction against the murlocs and report the results back to me.Those results being that you killed them all, as commanded!"
1573,"Catalysm : Coagulated rot is potent on its own, but we need something to activate its concealed powers... a catalyst.  You can find just such a catalyst to the south, in Lake Mereldar.If you look down, you'll notice that I slipped a set of flasks into your bags while you weren't looking.  These flasks can be used on the water elementals in the lake.  The living, corrupted water that flows through their bodies will be the perfect catalyst!"
1574,"Through the Troll Hole : It looks like Zanzil's portal into Zul'Gurub is still open.  Zul'Gurub is a dangerous place, but Chabal entrusted this task to you.The portal lies in wait in front of you."
1575,"I Think She's Hungry : It looks like your young raptor is hungry.  If you're looking to keep her, why don't you find something for her to eat?  The lashtail often attack the basilisks of Stranglethorn, which can be found to the east, beyond Kurzen's Compound.She probably isn't strong enough to hunt on her own yet, but I'm sure she will eat freshly killed basilisk meat."
1576,"Heartfelt Appreciation : You located all of our documents! We can't think you enough for the help... we'd all but given up hope that the dark irons would be able to act upon all of this information soon. It's good to know that they'll be left blind in their attacks for quite a while yet.To thank you for all of your efforts on our behalf, we would like to offer you a gift. An artifact really... something we recovered from one of our digs. You have the appreciation of all of the Explorers' League."
1577,"Madness : Our last two negotiators haven't returned from speaking with the Dragonmaw Warchief. I think we might need to flex a little bit of muscle.This time, I want YOU to accompany the negotiator. Their Warchief might think twice once he realizes the Horde is full of battle-hardened heroes like yourself.Simply escort our negotiator into the main hold in the center of Dragonmaw Port and look menacing."
1578,"Death to Mor'ghor : The time has come. Mor'ghor dies today.Be warned, <class>. Demon blood courses through his wretched veins, and he channels unnatural power. He will be destroyed, yes. But it will not be an easy fight.You remember where Mor'ghor resides, at the top of the camp. I will meet you there. Finish him!Be sure to recruit 3 Dragonmaw followers if you are short - you will need our help."
1579,"Darkhound Pounding : Lady Sylvanas has called upon the Royal Apothecary Society.  She has challenged us to concoct a new plague, a plague deadlier than any ailment on Azeroth. This new disease will bring our enemies - living and dead - to ruin.My studies show that the blood of beasts might prove to be the key. Here, fill these vials with darkhound blood so I can test my theory."
1580,"The Dead Scar : The black swath of soil that cuts through Eversong Woods is a permanent reminder of the day Arthas led the Scourge into our beloved city.This blemish is more than an eyesore as even today it brings Scourge from the Ghostlands to Silvermoon.Go, <name>, and give my men a hand in killing the mindless undead that walk down the Dead Scar."
1581,"Lost Armaments : The Wretched grow bolder every day, <name>.  They've achieved enough coordination to launch an attack on Sunsail Anchorage.As if that weren't embarrassing enough, most of our weapons were left behind when they attacked.  Bring me back our armaments so that we may show those ruffians who's boss."
1582,"We Must Prepare! : More of our citizens go missing every day. We think the gnolls are responsible, but we have no idea where they are taking them! If you are to help us defeat the gnolls and find our people, you must be properly equipped. Unfortunately, we are all out of gnomecorders. Without a gnomecorder, there is no way for us to communicate with you when you are in the field.Our last good gnomecorder was stolen by marauding murlocs last week. You will have to go to Lake Everstill, east of here, and recover it!"
1583,"Scholomancer : The Scholomance is one of the few Scourge holdouts remaining west of the Thondroril.  The headmaster of Scholomance, a cultist by the name of Darkmaster Gandling, has made an appearance on the battlefield.This will be his final mistake.You will find Gandling in a square near the southern end of town.  I want you to fight and weaken Gandling.  I will join you to help finish him off."
1584,"Culinary Crunch : This is intolerable!  I have nothing to work with here! Milady asks me to come from Silvermoon City; she deserves cuisine as befits her station.  No?  But I get here and there is no food.  You must go out, <class>, and bring back fresh kills so that I have something to prepare.Dame Auriferous prefers a crunchy texture to her food.  There are plenty of spindleweb lurkers to the southwest on the other side of the Dead Scar.  Disgusting, I know, but that's what we have to work with."
1585,"Marauders of Darrowshire : I require a rare reagent for the powerful spell I intend to cast: skulls from the scourge who took part in the battle of Darrowshire.Take this crystal and hunt scourge champions for their skulls.  The crystal is enchanted; if a champion took part in the battle, then when you pass the crystal over its skull it will resonate.  Bring me those resonating skulls.Go, <name>.  You'll find scourge champions in the Fungal Vale to the north.  Go."
1586,"Your First Day as a Pirate : Ye may be a slayer of Fleet Masters, but rules is rules and orders is orders.  And MY orders say that all new pirates start out as swabbies.  It's the rule.You're to be working for Captain Keelhaul, the commander of the Riptide.  It's the westernmost ship in the fleet, which is parked south of the tip o' the cape.Find him in his captain's chambers, and bring yer papers."
1587,"Open for Business : Welcome, <name>.There are a number of ways I can assist you in your efforts here.For example, I've recently discovered a recipe for a unique elixir.The bloodberry grows wild in many regions of Azeroth and has long been considered nothing more than a nuisance. I've learned though, that when exposed to the Sunwell's power this plant takes on special properties that can be distilled and imbibed to magnify one's abilites.Bring me a sample from the nearby bushes and I'll show you what I mean."
1588,"To Stonard : Regardless of whether you assist me within the temple, your people must be told of what is brewing here.Southwest of the temple is the Horde town of Stonard. The orcs there wage war with the new human arrivals to the swamp, a raging conflict that I foresee only worsening.It is not my role to interfere in mortal affairs, <name>. I simply ask you bring warning to your people of what lurks within the temple."
1589,"Quality Construction : Look here, chief, if it weren't for this bumbly idiot across from me, the Krazzworks would be holding up just fine.Unfortunately for everyone involved, ""Fancypants"" Rothman here decided to deploy the place on top of a mountain! I mean really, who does that?So, we got leaks all over the place due to faulty valves. Think you could take this blast tape and seal 'em up for me?"
1590,"Seasoned Wolf Kabobs : Seasoned wolf kabobs are a house favorite!  Sure, I can make you some.  But first I'll need the supplies.Bring me five wolf skirt steaks.  The dire wolves near the river north of town are good to hunt; I wouldn't stray too far into the woods if I were you."
1591,"The Truth of the Grave : Earlier on, I saw a young Forsaken woman running towards the old inn.  She was screaming for her life, pleading to be taken back home.Not all of us are as resolute as others, <name>.  Even so, we must accept our fate as undead if we are to rise up against those that would put us down.Take my hand mirror and show it to the young woman.  She needs to see what she really is, and join us in our cause.  Besides... we can use all the bodies that we can get."
1592,"Wine Shop Advert : If you talk to anyone about wine, then you know we Gallinas sell the best wine in Stormwind.  And we're not far, still in the Trade District along the city's lovely canals.Here, take this pamphlet.  Bring it to my sister Suzetta at our shop for a complimentary bottle of the famous Dalaran Noir.  You won't regret it!"
1593,"In Defense of the Redoubt : Calen sent word - the Twilight are within the redoubt!If there will ever be a time when you can earn his favor, this is it!"
1594,"Hero's Call: Badlands! : By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Gek Nozzlerocket at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands.Your help is needed to survey the damage done by Deathwing, and the disposition of Horde forces in the Badlands.Gek has agreed to provide transportation to the Badlands via rocket, in exchange for your help. Look for him at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands.For the glory and honor of the Alliance!"
1595,"Brothers In Arms : Listen, <name>.  For the first time since the civil war I agree with Greymane.  Now is the time to put aside our quarrel.It sure doesn't look like these beasts care much whether you're a rebel or a royal.Send word back to Greymane.  My men will join his.There's a safehouse not far from here, in Josiah's cellar.  My lads stashed some heavy artillery there.Tell our king that my arsenals are now at his disposal."
1596,"Quel'Danil Lodge : I may appear far from home to you, <class>, but quite a few of my people were led here by Ambassador Rualeth. We have settled with the high elves of the Quel'Danil Lodge, to the northwest, to train in the ways of the Light and enjoy the peaceful beauty of this land.Such peace may be short lived. We have seen the Horde moving further west from here. Could you travel to Quel'Danil and give warning to Anchorite Traska? Her cabin is just north of the main lodge."
1597,"Vyrin's Revenge : I don't suppose you'd be interested in a little payback for His Boldness? Daryl does have some skill, it pains me to say.A year ago, a large bear had been the target of the Farstrider Lodge, but none of the hunters had any luck with him. So, Daryl thought he'd try his hand against him. All he had to show for his effort was that ugly scar over his eye.Kill the bear, and I'm sure even Daryl would be speechless for once.The bear, Ol' Sooty, can be found around his lair in the cave to the north."
1598,"The Third Fleet : I was once First Mate on the Wave Mistress, ship-of-the-line in the Kul Tiras Third Fleet.  The Doomed Fleet.  Doomed, for on its last voyage the fleet was attacked by red dragons.  Dragons controlled by orcs!We didn't stand a chance against that dragonfire...and our fleet was burned and sunk off this here coast.  I'm the sole survivor of those poor vessels......Bring me my mead, <class>. It's down in the cellar of the inn. As far away as I put it from me, I can't go without it in the end."
1599,"You Say You Want a Revolution : If what you say is true, <name>, then we have friends within the Dragonmaw Clan. We can support an insurgency from within their ranks and avoid a lot of bloodshed on both sides.I can help, but the most dangerous part is up to you.My Axebite Warriors will launch an offensive on the shores. During the confusion, I need you to slip behind the lines and speak with your revolutionary contact, Zaela.We'll arm the Dragonmaw and overthrow their fel masters!"
1600,"Third Sample: Implanted Eggs : Nyxondra is being held against her will.  She is hidden from her brood, right in the middle of their breeding grounds.  She lays eggs, but they will be taken away before she can see them hatch.Cruel?  Perhaps... but not nearly as cruel as the treatment that their dragonflight showed my mistress.Show me that I can trust you, <name>.  Take Nyxondra's eggs, and bring them here.  You will need to beat Nyxondra into submission before you can take them."
1601,"It's Never Over : Those Blackrock orcs are gonna need an army to handle the Bravo Company and you, <name>. When you're ready to go, meet us at the dock facing Lake Everstill and we'll set off on my riverboat for Camp Everstill on the other side of the lake.See you there, <name>."
1602,"Protecting Our Rear : The only reason you see me standing aside Alliance soldiers is because our duty outweighs our enmity... however slightly.  We have been charged with protecting the Dark Portal from unauthorized travel, and with the recent cataclysm, we are particularly susceptible to an attack.  We've already heard reports of black dragons in the area...With my men focused on their duty, we need someone to keep the area demons in check.  Around the portal you will find three demon lieutenants.  Slay them."
1603,"Welcome to the Jungle : Welcome to Stranglethorn!Perhaps you're not aware of this, but that dwarf over there is the son of the one and only Hemet Nesingwary, renowned war hero of the Alliance and master big game hunter.  Like his father, he's not one for welcoming strangers into his camp, but you look like you've seen quite a bit of action in your day, <class>.Go and speak with him.  He's a chip off the old block, so perhaps he can give you some hunting pointers."
1604,"Anomalous Anomalies : Dalaran's move to this location was intended to be a temporary measure, but we may need to depart sooner than expected.Blinking a city across the world is no mean feat. The magnitude of energies involved can lead to... unexpected side effects.Arcane anomalies are causing mischief throughout the city. Their presence could destabilize any attempt to blink again.We don't have time to let them dissipate on their own, <name>. I have a device that will help speed things along."
1605,"A Scarlet Letter : Lieutenant Gebler:How curious that you would decide to take a prisoner... an undead one at that.  What were you thinking?  Do you think that, just because of the prisoner's former status, that she would be above the edicts of the Scarlet Crusade?This is most troubling, Gebler.  I would remind you that there are penalties for such behavior.  I command you to execute the prisoner at once.  She is no longer one of us."
1606,"Hero's Call: Wetlands! : By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Mountaineer Rharen at Dun Algaz.In the wake of the cataclysm's destruction, Wetlands has become overrun with wild beasts, orcish raiders, and savage gnolls! To reach the Wetlands, you must travel north from Loch Modan through the dwarven hold of Dun Algaz.For the glory and honor of the Alliance!"
1607,Deeprun Rat Roundup : Avast ye scallywag. Arrrr... Arrrr ye looking fer work? We gots a serious rat problem down here an' not enough hands on the poop deck.What do ye say? All ye needs to do is take this here rat catchin' flute and play the melody around the vermin. They'll follow ye to the ends of the world!Just capture five of the little buggers and bring em back here. We needs em alive.Arrrrr...
1608,"Siege Tank Rescue : One by one, we're gonna have to pull our siege tanks outta the muck. Take these 'ere spare parts you've collected and give 'em to a siege tank commander who's standing on top of a gimped-up machine.Then defend the tank while engineers de-gimpify it.Go an' make me proud, <class>!"
1609,"Free Wil'hai : Those tentacle horrors rising from the depths have trapped that poor beast. Please, <name>, can you save it by destroying those things?Will you free Wil'hai?Here, take my totem and plant it near the tentacles. The cold it emanates will cause major shrinkage on those monsters and then you'll be able to destroy them."
1610,"Rough Roads : The Argent Crusade built these towers to be points of light in the darkness of the Plaguelands.  I walk the paths between these towers, protecting and maintaining them.The roads have been dangerous lately.  Plagued wildlife runs rampant, and bats swoop down upon unsuspecting travelers.  It would make the next leg of my journey much easier if you could clear some of this wildlife out of the way for me."
1611,"Return to MacKinley : Here, take this pouch and give it to Sea Wolf.  And tell him I meant to pay him back!  I swear!!I just got a little drunk and lost my way, and...you know how things are.  He'll understand - you don't have to get rough!"
1612,"Alas, Andorhal : Head south, to Chillwind Camp.  Tell Commander Ashlam Valorfist everything that happened here.Me?  I'm going west, into Tirisfal.My battle's not over yet.  I've got an appointment with that harpy that calls herself a Banshee Queen... and I'm finding out what she did to Koltira."
1613,"Mostly Harmless : Here's another favor you can do for me, pal.We had a whole shipment of Landmines come in from Booty Bay just the other day. But someone stole the whole lot of 'em in the night!Whoever it was must be sloppy, because they dropped them all over the swamp to the east. No goblin I know would be that careless.I need you to go gather those landmines up for me. I'm sure they're perfectly safe and disarmed. Every single one. Yup."
1614,"The Fall of Jintha'Alor : We've got more to deal with than just dwarves, mon. While I watch the village, my mate Primal Torntusk has gone to lead our warriors against the wicked Vilebranch tribe.They've killed our brothers, and I was even taken prisoner by them once. No more! This time, the city of Jintha'Alor falls to us.Go to Jintha'Alor and speak with my mate. She's captured a camp near the entrance to the city."
1615,"Shelled Salvation : A lot of the men haven't made it to the cave yet. It's a safe bet that they're stranded at the vents on the ridge above us.We found some spiralung shells on the way here. They don't produce much air, but it was enough for us to make the cave.I need to stay here to count heads and get them back on their feet as they arrive. Do me a favor - go collect those spiralung shells, get them to any of my men that are still up on the ridge, and give them a swift kick in the arse so that they get moving."
1616,"The Eye of Shadra : Gryphon Master Talonaxe has sent me here to deal with Shadra, the Venom Queen. The conquest of Jintha'Alor isn't enough... the trolls could regroup and summon this creature later, when we're not expecting it.We'll gather the artifacts first, pull Shadra into this world on our own terms, and put our hammers to that foul creature. I'll need you to help find the artifacts, and put a hurt on the rest of the trolls while you're at it.We first need the Eye of Shadra, guarded in Agol'watha to the north."
1617,"Gauging Success : Vicious louts... they did a lot of damage with those spears.<The admiral winces slightly as he clutches a wound on his side.>We'll hold here as long as we can for all the men to make it. I need someone to scout their numbers to see how much damage we did.One of the biggest groups of them was around the corner on the northwest portion of this round terrace, and the other was a bit farther to the north in the small tunnel, also on this middle level of the ruins.Up for some scouting?"
1618,"Gizmos and Gadgets : I've been coming up short on parts recently for my engineering projects, and the other day I finally saw why: the Mosshide gnolls have been making off with them!I don't have any idea what they could possibly want them for, but I need those gizmos back. They're probably strewn all over the marsh by now, but if you see any, could you gather them and bring them back?"
1619,"Meet Two-Shoed Lou : Looks like we got ourselves a real ""whodunit"" here, rookie. Unfortunately, it looks like the locals aren't willing to talk and the clues you got off the gnolls and murlocs are damn near worthless. We're going to have to initiate plan... be on the lookout for Two-Shoed Lou.Two-Shoed Lou is an old confidential informant of mine who, ironically, makes his home at the Furlbrow's old pumpkin farm. Head west to the farm and find out what Lou knows.If he gives you any guff tell him that Horatio sent you."
1620,"Fish Heads, Fish Heads... : Greetings, <class>.  Take a look toward the shore; what do you see?  That's right, our beach... our Tranquil Shore, has been infested with the malignancy known as the murloc.This blight will not stand!I have a task for you.  If you feel that you're up to it, I would have their heads!  Let us see if we can put a dent in their numbers so large that, if they have any sense at all, they will return to the murky depths from which they sprang!"
1621,"Any Portal in a Storm : Our friends in the Earthen Ring have been trying to open portals back to Stormwind, with no luck. But Thordun here tells me he might just have the key.The crazed water elementals in the nearby Verrall River Delta have been sent into a frenzy. Thordun tells me we can channel their energy into a portal.I don't understand all this elemental-claptrap, but I understand one thing: killin' elementals and takin' their whirlpool cores. Deliver them to Talaa in the courtyard!"
1622,"Darkblaze, Brood of the Worldbreaker : As Troteman cuts out, the world around you grows eerily silent. In the distance you see a full grown black dragon!"
1623,"The Battle Must Go On : We must continue to defeat and demoralize the armies of the Legion.The emissaries of hate are Legion shocktroopers deployed to reinforce tactical Legion positions.  The enemy rallies around them for they fear them more than they fear us.Today we will change that.  Take this banner and slay the demons of the Legion.  When you meet the emissary, slay and impale him."
1624,"Augustus' Receipt Book : I'm ready for business!  What do you want?Oh wait... I can't open up shop without my receipt book.  How am I to keep track of things without my receipt book?I must have left it in town somewhere.  I had a room in the inn... the book must be there.Bring me my book.  Please, bring it to me!  Bring me my book and you'll see!  I'll set up shop and you'll see that my prices are INSANE!"
1625,"Introductions Are in Order : The Forsaken are right on our heels and now these ogres are trying to flank us, <name>.They're servants of the ettin Koroth -- the meanest, most destructive force in all of Gilneas.If we can bait Koroth into charging the Forsaken's forward force, we should be able to cover our retreat and buy some time.The only way this can work is if we make Koroth furious.  It won't be enough to just kill his minions.  We need to swipe his most prized possession, a tiger-skinned banner."
1626,"The Durnholde Challenge: Infernus : According to the guide, Infernus is your next challenge. This being, made of molten lava and raging fire, can be found on the lower level of Durnholde Keep, near the eastern prisons."
1627,"Revantusk Village : Not all forest trolls are foul nuisances like the Witherbark. North of here in the Hinterlands is Revantusk Village, home to the only forest troll tribe still allied with the Horde.Even they cannot escape the cruelty of their brethren. The Vilebranch tribe wars with them, distracting them from our battle with the Alliance.You have fought well here. Speak with Urda if you wish to fly to Revantusk. Their village will have use of your strength."
1628,"Spelunking : Hurry, <name>!Make your way to that cavern at once.We shall go behind you to ensure that you are not followed."
1629,"The Warden's Time : <Erunak's image penetrates your mind.>You have done well, <name>, but more remains to be done.Before moving on from this place, let us be sure that we leave it in disarray.Find the one who leads these naga and repay him for his misdeeds."
1630,"Seize the Ambassador : The ambassador's betrayal will long haunt me. You must arrest him before he can do further harm, or worse, before he can escape and start planning the next attack. Ironforge is not safe with Ambassador Slaghammer free inside the city.Take these manacles and go to the Dark Iron embassy. It's just to the north of the High Seat, around the rim of the Great Forge. Arrest Ambassador Slaghammer and return with him."
1631,"Gurubashi Challenge : You've returned, <race>.  That means you've felt the call of the arena once more.  Very well.Take this battle standard, <race>, and place it down on the arena floor.  Defeat the summoned combatant, then return to me.Stay on your toes, <race>.  Anything goes inside the Gurubashi Arena."
1632,"Hammerfall : You have served us well here, <name>. Now that we've made our mark, the next phase of our conquest will occur over months rather than minutes.There is much work yet to be done, and I will spare you the tedium of waiting for our fortifications to trickle in. Travel to the east, to Hammerfall. The orcs there will no doubt have use of your aid."
1633,"The Trek Continues : I believe the horses are ready.  Argus Highbeacon, the gentleman who works with the Argent Crusade, spoke with me earlier.  I understand he will be coming with us... that's great!  I'll make room for him.I know that you are busy, so there's no hurry.  Whenever you're ready, hop into the caravan, and we will proceed to the next tower."
1634,"Art of Attraction : I have an idea. A brilliant idea! Those clown-looking fish have developed a symbiotic defensive relationship with the anemones. Having dismissed anemone disguise plausibilities, I've uncovered the chemical attractor that lures the fish.I have a gyrocoptic thermascrub extractor that I've brought down to take samples. Use it to extract the chemical attractor from several of the anemones, then bring the samples back to me for rapid synthesis and deployment.Go with haste! Brilliance is waiting!"
1635,"Hostile Waters : Hexascrub came out here with a balloon of some sort that he retrieved from one of our ships. He tried to float it to the top, but those Muckskin Scroungers came out of nowhere and swarmed the thing.He's got an idea for another balloon, but we need to make sure that the past doesn't repeat itself. I need you to kill off those gill goblins. Or at the very least, enough of them to make them a bit more wary of us."
1636,"Times are Tough : Times are tough, <brother/sister>. With the downtrodden masses of Stormwind migrating into Westfall, resources are stretched as thin as they've ever been. The people are restless and in need of help.Our own farmhouse has been serving as a halfway house for years. Salma does the best that she can to keep our guests alive, but sometimes the watchers get 'em. Watchers are those twisted abominations roaming my fields - a little present left behind by the Defias, before they were driven off. Help us!"
1637,Krakauer : Krakauer is up on the chopping block as we speak! The orcs brought in a Gurubashi witch doctor to perform a dark ritual on him. We need to kill that troll to free Krakauer!Let's go! He's just inside the cave here. Hang a right at the first fork.
1638,"Rise, Godfrey : You are unwavering in your loyalty to the Forsaken, <name>. Know that what you have done for us - for the Horde - will not go unnoticed. With Lord Godfrey and his men recovered, we will have a great advantage over the Gilneas Liberation Front and the rest of the Alliance dogs.Now stand by my side as Lord Godfrey is reborn as one of us. Together we will bring him and his men into the fold."
1639,"Gurubashi Challenge: Free-For-All Arena Combat : The arena is a place of battle unlike any other.  Inside, you have no friends.  Alliances that do form are fleeting, as your allies can turn on you in the blink of an eye.  Horde vs. Alliance, Alliance vs. Alliance, Horde vs. Horde... anything goes.Take this battle standard, <race>, and place it down on the arena floor.  Defeat the summoned combatant, then return to me.Stay on your toes, <race>.  Anything goes inside the Gurubashi Arena."
1640,"And the Sky Streaked Red : With Deathwing otherwise occupied, we have a grim and daunting task ahead of us, under charge of the queen herself. The black dragonflight is to be wiped out.I would welcome your aid in this, if it is offered. As soon as you are ready, I will send you with the next flight joining the attack."
1641,"A Curious Oddity : Well sweet pea, I have good news and bad news for you. The good news is that you brought me enough coins to complete this new misprint set! The bad news is that not a single one of them has matched the original partial set.See here - this coin has two heads. And the face on the reverse is grinning at me, where he was looking so dour only an hour ago. This one squints when I shine a light on it. Such a mystery! I must have more!"
1642,"Ain't Too Proud to Beg : Now that you've brought me to safety, I'm afraid I must impose upon your kindness just a bit further.The captain of our ship, Samir, is still out there. Mack too. I'm sure they made it to the sea floor but beyond that I didn't see what became of them.I simply couldn't get by in a place like this without their help.I lost sight of them in a clump of kelp west of where you found me.Please hurry! They couldn't have gotten far..."
1643,"Frostmane Aggression : The cataclysm has thrown the balance of power in Dun Morogh into question, <name>. Without warning, a wave of troggs emerged from the caves near Gnomeregan and overran the Frostmane trolls. The trolls have been migrating east ever since.There has always been a Frostmane presence up on Shimmer Ridge, to the northwest, but with the migration, the trolls now surround us. We can't allow the trolls to use this position to their advantage. While my men hold the line in the east, strike against Shimmer Ridge."
1644,"Recon Essentials : We used to have more stuff around here.  I think there was a spyglass somewhere nearby, along with a smithing tuyere.I'm pretty certain that they've been stolen by Dark Iron dwarves.  Yes, I know that I'm a Dark Iron dwarf!  I'm talking about the bad ones that live down in that gorge.You'd best check the steamsmiths that work just south of here.  They'd be most likely to use tools like these."
1645,"In Defense of Westfall : After my tour of duty was over in Grizzly Hills, I returned to Westfall, only to find the land in worse condition than when I left.The price of our war left thousands of citizens homeless. They now migrate here and squat upon the deserted farmhouses and towns of the region.To make matters worse, we are now under attack by the gnolls. The Westfall Brigade needs your help, <name>. Slay the attacking gnolls and recover their orders. Someone is pulling their strings and we need to find out whom!"
1646,"Panther Hunting : If you want to be a part of the hunt with this crack group under Hemet Jr.'s leadership, you're going to need to prove yourself an able panther hunter.  You should start out easy: just focus on the young panthers for now.  As you improve and gain experience as a hunter, you will undoubtedly find increasingly dangerous quarry.Start by heading east.  Return to me when you are a master panther hunter."
1647,"Night Terrors : Me friend Uchek is in de cave already. We set up three shrines inside. All you gotta do is flush out de bad juju from each one, mon.Go inside de cave here and talk to Uchek. He put you in a trance, put you in de spirit realm. Tread carefully! If you see a ghostly beast, you don't be panicking. Shine de Light of Souls on de beast for a moment or two, and de light will send 'em away for good. De light will keep you safe. Now go cleanse de three shrines!"
1648,"Pool Pony Rescue : This jerk across from me is getting all of our people killed!Brett ""the Bummer"" unpacked the Krazzworks in the wrong place and now it's highly unstable. The explosions from the instability are throwing our laborers off of the platforms and into the water below.You don't mind flying down there and rescuing them with some pool ponies, <name>?"
1649,"Warchief's Command: Hillsbrad Foothills! : All able bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to High Executor Darthalia at Southpoint Gate in Hillsbrad Foothills. The Forsaken war machine marches ever onward, securing Lordaeron for the Horde!To reach Southpoint Gate you must follow the road south through Silverpine Forest and take the east fork leading into Hillsbrad Foothills.Onward, <brother/sister>! Destiny calls!"
1650,"No Trespass Forgiven : I know that you, like our revered lady, have unfortunate streaks of mercy that you succumb to at times. I would advise against such kindnesses this day. The Kvaldir are proud, and they will strike back if we do not cripple them completely. Kill all that you find.Sadly, I have the inglorious task of making sure none return to the city, so you can go have all of the fun. I will cheer you on though, of course."
1651,A Lumbering Relic : Margol the Rager's an old thunder lizard seen round these parts.  Legend has it that he's been here in the gorge since before it was even a gorge.  Legend also has it that he ate my brother Barnabas.I don't care how old he is or what kind of magic he shoots out of his nose.  I just want him dead.  For Barnabas' sake.You'll find him wandering the cliffs to the south of here.
1652,
1653,"Move the Mountain : If the Twilight Gate is to fall, we need to get Skullcrusher the Mountain out of there!Before they left, I saw to it that your SI:7 agents took some explosives hidden in a Twilight's Hammer crate. By now, they will have planted them on the steps leading up to the upper portion of the Citadel.I want you to set the explosives off and then signal us when that monster's out of the way.That's when we'll attack and finish off the ogre compound!"
1654,"Parker's Report : <Watch Captain Parker hands you a report.>Here it is, <name>. Take my report to Lakeshire, located north of this tower, and deliver it to Magistrate Solomon. Inform him that we need a more comprehensive solution for dealing with the gnolls. Suggest explosives. Lots of explosives.And stick to the road if you know what's good for you.What's good for you is staying alive, by the way. In case you didn't know what was good for you. You now know... Oh never mind!"
1655,"Canyon Romp : <The gnomecorder hums.>The first order of business is a romp through the Redridge Canyons, directly north of Lakeshire. Kill every gnome that you see... woops, did I say gnome? I meant gnoll. Kill every GNOLL that you see and take their collars as proof of deed.I must warn you, <name>; while you are out there, watch out for ettins. My scouts have reported seeing huge, bloodthirsty ettins roaming the canyons lately. Stay out of their way if you want to remain alive.Solomon out. I'll be in touch."
1656,"Wretched Ringleader : The Wretched are so oblivious, gorging on foul magic, that they haven't realized we've recovered most of our weapons.  We can't expect them to remain in their stupor, though.  Now is the time for a decisive attack.  Let us make an example of their leader, Aldaron.  He was spotted on the top floor of the building by the anchorage.  Bring me his head; I'll reward you suitably."
1657,Plunging Into Zul'Gurub : Zanzil the Outcast has once again escaped through one of his portals.  Follow him!
1658,The Gates of Grim Batol : Kroggs started the assault to push up the canyon. He's just past the gate to our southeast.I'm going to get the squad together to join the attack. We'll meet you down there.
1659,"Legends of the Sunken Temple : I will need you to enter the temple first, <name>. I can join you once a path is secure, but I dare not enter blindly. Turned against my kind, I would be a vicious enemy.You can start by descending the stairs behind me. Then, swim through the flooded depths of the Broken Hall. Once there, follow the passageway to the right to find the Hall of Masks.Beware of any temple guards. Once you have found the Hall of Masks, I will contact you through the Oathstone."
1660,"Grunt Work : Bah!  You're lucky I'm short-handed today.  Otherwise I'd make you my personal whipping <boy/girl> for the week.The officers and high-ranking soldiers need their boots polished.  They've left them out in front of their huts.I want to see my reflection in those boots, grunt!  Get to work!"
1661,"Trouble at the Sludge Fields : Warden Stillwater, over at the Sludge Fields, north of here, has sent out a distress signal. The missive wasn't clear, but from what I could make of the letter there's a riot happening at the Sludge Fields and most of the guards have been killed. The warden has warned that any would-be-heroes approach from the back entry, located on the western side of the Sludge Fields.He's also asked for discretion. He doesn't want news of this little *ahem* uprising to surface."
1662,"Hold the Line! : Hey, you there!  Ye're a stout-looking <class>.  Lend us a hand?It looks like today's big earthquake shook a bunch o' those barbarous troggs out of the ground, and they're sure steamed about something.  My men are doing what they can to hold them off, but we could use a hand.Do yer part - head just south of here and help dig me mountaineers outta trouble.  We've got to hold the line!"
1663,"Bones That Walk : There's even fouler undead left to deal with, <name>.Tranquil Gardens Cemetery, further south of town, is a place you don't want to be caught in at night. The bones that rise from the ground there are cunning enough to remember how to swing an axe or cast a spell.I shouldn't need to explain how dangerous that makes them. Proceed with caution, but remember the people of Darkshire that will suffer if you falter."
1664,"Pack Your Bags : The weight limit on my gyro is such that I only have enough room for one <race>.  Looks like you're in luck, <name>!That dwarf woman Jona told me that most of your personal belongings have been moved inside Anvilmar.  Please gather what you'll need, finish up any affairs that remain, and return to me when you're prepared for takeoff."
1665,"Making Contact : You aren't one of the zombies...A troll?  I did see one, just before the outbreak...  He warned us, told us to be on our guard... But it was too late.Your troll friend headed to Booty Bay to warn them..."
1666,"Reoccupation : There's no shortage of Kvaldir to slaughter. They're obviously still reeling from our assault.  The city has been desolate so long, I doubt they expected any naga to contest them here.There have been no reports yet of their leader. I'm sure that culling them further will force the coward to rear his head soon enough.Shall we continue?"
1667,Stolen Property : Our revered lady has sent me to aid you in your task. She wants you to retrieve the stolen Crucible of Nazsharin and bring it back here as soon as you can.She grows impatient to start the ritual of summoning so that we might fully begin our preparations for war.
1668,"Help from Steelgrill's Depot : With your help, we've managed to push toward Frostmane Retreat. Our forces will soon be in position to dwindle down the Frostmane trolls' reserves, leaving their village open to attack.That's where the Gnomeregan covert ops team comes in. Their technicians have figured out a way to deploy operatives behind enemy lines without alerting the Frostmanes to our presence. Head to Steelgrill's Depot, just northeast of town, and speak with Delber Cranktoggle. He'll tell you more about it."
1669,"WANTED: Redridge Gnolls : By order of the Stormwind Royal Guard, all gnolls of the region known as Three Corners in the southwestern corner of Redridge Mountains, are wanted dead.Should you dispatch of the gnolls of the region, report your victory to Watch Captain Parker at Tower Watch."
1670,"An Unwelcome Guest : Once again my garden was trampled and pillaged.  And I know the brute who is doing it.  It's that forsaken boar, the one Marshal Marris has taken to calling Bellygrub.I won't be able to re-plant the daffodils until next season now.  Ruined!  All ruined by that one menacing boar.  Put an end to that pest!  Show me his tusk and I'd be happy to reward you.  He seems to spend his time foraging in the field southwest of Lakeshire but occasionally he roams over here and into my garden."
1671,"Environmental Awareness : Have you ever smelled submarine fuel, <name>?  It's nasty stuff.  Unfortunately, we need to burn huge amounts of it to get the Verne to move, and it's both bad-smelling AND deadly to the local wildlife.  We need to be more environmentally conscious.The sea creatures nearby have particularly oily flesh.  Take this device up to Seabrush - just above this cave - and use it on the corpses of terrapins, remoras, and hammerhead sharks.  Their oil might save the lives of hundreds of other sea creatures."
1672,"Blood on the Sand : And with that, our mission is done.  Let's verify that Guzbert and Kelsey return safely from their demo sites, and then we can head back to friendlier shores."
1673,"Windrunner Village : <name>, the final battle against the Ghostlands villages is upon you. Windrunner Village to the southwest has been overrun by a large force of the more powerful Scourge shocktroopers; shades and gargoyles. You will be the spearpoint of our offensive by thinning out their numbers.The magisters at the nearby Sanctum of the Sun have made a special request this time; they want the remains from these Scourge to study in hopes of finding creative ways of fighting them.Good hunting!"
1674,"False Idols : Neptulon the Tidehunter is our god.  He was the god of the Bloodwash, too, but they have turned their back on him, it seems.  They now choose to worship only Azshara, their naga queen.  You will see likenesses of Azshara littered around their settlements, carved out of seastone.<The murloc spirit eyes your weapon.>That weapon will do.  Send it through their Azsh'ir idols.  They need to be reminded that our father Neptulon is the only one who truly rules the seas."
1675,"Captives at Deatholme : Ah, yes.  One of my finest creations.  This draught will break most forms of alchemically induced stupor.Side effects include confusion, nausea and - in rare cases - temporary blindness.  All much preferable to whatever the Scourge plans to do to those prisoners in Deatholme, if you ask me.Best of luck, brave <class>.  You are going to need it."
1676,"Shakes O'Breen : You're all right, <name>. It's not every day you come across a so-called hero that has a clue what they're doing once they get this far from home, so I'll let you in on some more work.I've a friend by the name of Shakes O'Breen. He's the captain of a crew of pirates, the Blackwater Raiders; good men, respectable as pirates go. They dock at Faldir's Cove, hidden along the southern shore.I'm sure O'Breen will have lucrative jobs for you if you're interested."
1677,"A Boyhood Dream : I've always wanted to join the Crusade.  It's the reason I became a paladin.  Years of practice, honing my craft... I'm finally ready.Tarenar thinks he's ready, too, but I'm not sure.  He's a bit of a showboat, and he never took his lessons seriously.  Still, we promised we'd do this together, and here we are.Shall we head into the chapel now?"
1678,"Drinks on the Rocks : What's up, ""bro""! We were just in the middle of our completely spontaneous beach party when something terrible happened, ""dude""!I had a whole case of Silversnap Ice, the Baron's own drink of choice, until the silt crawlers stole them! I've never seen crawlers drink, but they took them right into the water and down the beach! We need some sort of awesome hero who can help retrieve our specifically-branded favorite beverage!<Brono stares at you a moment.>That means you, ""brah""!"
1679,"Grandma's Cat : Right!  About the evacuation, dear.I just cannot leave without my cat.  He's an adorable orange tabby.Chance's favorite spot to play is a broken down cart near an arbor northeast of here.Bring him here and we'll be on our way."
1680,"Blessing of the Green Dragonflight : You have done well, <name>. Jammal'an may have escaped our grasp, but his retreat paves the way for me to enter the temple as I desire.Stay where you are and do not move. I will hasten your return by pulling your spirit to me through the Emerald Dream.This may cause slight drowsiness."
1681,"Betrayal at Tempest's Reach : King Greymane has been taken prisoner by Lord Godfrey in Tempest's Reach!He managed to convince two of the eastern lords to go with his plan.  The fool seems to think he can strike a deal with the Forsaken by turning Greymane over to them.Listen carefully, <name>.  We need to resolve this with as little bloodshed as possible.This potion will allow you to sneak in undetected.  We need you to assassinate the traitorous lords before this gets out of hand!"
1682,"Bad Supplies : Some of da survivors mentioned food, <name>.  We better check da food supplies.  I gotta a bad feelin' about dis."
1683,"Mystery Notebook : This book has seen better days. Not much can be made out between the waterlogging and the apparent animal bites, but a few poor attempts at poetry center around the ""radiant glow"" of the Undercity and someone named Estelle Gendry."
1684,"Resupplying the Excavation : Ironband has an excavation to the southeast and he's been needing a hefty amount of explosives sent from the league for all the carving. Huldar, Miran, and Saean just departed with the most recent load and could probably use a hand.They can't have made it very far, strong as they are. They can only move so fast laden down with those barrels.They're taking the normal route to the site, leaving south out of town and following the curve of the Loch. Go catch up with them and help'm out, will ya?"
1685,"Razorbeak Friends : Our clan reveres the gryphon as a sacred animal. They're majestic creatures of the skies, and more than just beasts; they're intelligent and cunning.Some say we keep them, but it's more of a friendship. If you want to befriend the Wildhammer here, first befriend our gryphons! Take this bag o' chow, it's nice and fresh. Our trained razorbeak gryphons wander the forests to the south of the aviary. Go on and feed a few of 'em for me, aye?"
1686,"Can't Start a Fire Without a Spark : Mack's still out of it, and I fear we may lose him if I can't get this fire started. With the wood being soaked, we'll need something special to get it going.There's an abandoned camp nearby with a barrel of explosives in it. There's no way I can recover it on my own.Would you mind hauling it back for us? For Mack?"
1687,"Kill 'em With Sleep Deprivation : It's a little known fact that dwarves, particularly of the Dark Iron variety, need rest! Lots of rest!Now I ask you; How can they sleep without pillows?  Exactly, <name>, they can't.  This is why you must steal their pillows.Once you've finished your cushion-thievery, talk with Taskmaster Scrange.  He's a bit deeper in the cave, working on a covert project with Hansel."
1688,"Gnoll Escape : I know we were just attacking the gnolls ourselves, but I'm not about to let the Dark Iron capture them as slaves. For one, we found the thieves and took back what was missing, so justice is served; for another, whatever work the Dark Iron will be putting them to isn't something I want to allow.Either way, the gnolls need to be freed. The trappers should have keys on them, so use those to open the cages."
1689,"Young Twilight Scale : <A partially-grown scale from a young twilight whelp.  More and more twilight dragons are appearing once again. This seems suspicious.  You should show the scale to Eryna above Grim Batol in the Wetlands, perhaps she has seen something recently.>"
1690,"Fairbreeze Village : I have another task for you, <name>.  Ranger Degolien was sent to Fairbreeze Village to find out more about a Wretched attack on a nearby shipyard.  He has requested reinforcements which we cannot yet provide.  Seek him out and grant him whatever aid you can.Fairbreeze Village can be reached by following the road out of Falconwing Square all the way towards the south.  Good luck, <name>."
1691,"Nethergarde Reigns : Lungertz is a strong leader, but he is proud.  He understates the pressure that the Horde is really putting on us.  Without our mine... Nethergarde is penniless.We need to move the Horde forces from the supply camp NOW, and doing so means killing their commander, Captain Metlek.  He's not a strong leader, and prefers to bark orders from the back lines, but even so, his death might buy us the victory we need."
1692,"A Gift For Fiona : My traveling companion, Fiona, runs a small vendor's shop out of her caravan.  She and I, along with our friend Gidwin, are all on our way to Light's Hope Chapel.  I'm sure you can join us, if you like... though Fiona might be a little mad at me.Fiona always forgets why she's mad if you give her a gift.  Kill some of the plaguehounds north of here, then bring their blood to Fiona at the caravan, down by the river.  She'll love it.  We'll talk again there."
1693,"Mr. Goldmine's Wild Ride : Okay, <name>, we need to get to the earth portal at the back of the cave.I've ""procured"" a ride for us. Why walk when we can ride in style? I hope you don't mind mine carts.Let me know when you're ready."
1694,War on Deatholme : If you seek to aid our cause there is no better place to start than here and no better time to do it than now.By rebuilding the Sanctum of the Sun we've raised a banner of defiance in front of our enemy's seat of power: Deatholme.Go forth and fight the hordes of undead that inhabit the vile Scourge fortress.
1695,"Recipe for Disaster : Did you see that explosion I made?  I must have flown 10 inches off the ground!I've just got to get Zanzil's recipe so I can find out why it did that.  One of Zanzil's flunkies at the Ruins of Aboraz must have it on him.  Head east, to the coast of the Cape, and snatch it for me!"
1696,"Bad Medicine : I have a feeling that Kurzen's Medicine Men are distributing more than just medicine.  Kurzen needs some way to quelch insubordination, and an elixir under the guise of ""medicine"" would be the perfect way to do that.We need those remedies for research.  Search the Kurzen Compound to the southeast - his medicine men and jungle fighters should carry the remedies on their bodies."
1697,"Domination : <Melisara's thoughts intermingle with your thoughts.>The last task will be an assault against the siege technicians of Gavin's Naze, located west of the Headland. Venture to the final finger and lay waste to the dwarf and gnome engineers that build and fortify the Stormpike machines of war. Be sure to plant Cromush's final pocket-nuke as well."
1698,"Evacuate the Merchant Square : The civilians aren't safe here anymore.  Not even inside their homes.We're doing our best to stop the worgen from getting indoors, but their numbers are too great.Help us by evacuating the civilian homes.  My father's army in the prison district will be able to better protect them."
1699,"The Rebel Lord's Arsenal : The arsenal Crowley speaks of is in the cellar of a building just west of here.It is unnerving that artillery was smuggled inside the city by my enemies, yet it might end up saving Gilnean lives today.Find Josiah Avery and requisition the rebel artillery.  We will put the weapons to good use."
1700,"A Tiny, Clever Commander : We've dealt with kobolds in these lands for years. Not much other than a nuisance. But they've been getting craftier at their stealing.I think one of them's ended up smarter than usual. Won't be that way for long, though!I want you to go to the camp south of here and make sure there's not a ""big shot"" kobold stirrin' up the other ones. Make sure to check the cave; it's a likely spot.And don't be shy about clearing out the other kobolds along the way."
1701,"Demanding Answers : So just how did all those Dark Iron warriors end up here, on the doorstep of Ironforge, on the verge of invading our city?Does not 'Empress' Moira, a member of our esteemed Council of Three Hammers, rule the Dark Iron? This cannot have happened without her knowledge and consent. This was no ragtag band of rebel dwarves, but a well-organized and fully equipped invasion force.I have prepared a report on the battle for the airfield. Take it to Ironforge, to the High Seat and confront her!"
1702,"Into the Dragon's Mouth : <Dr. Blam stares at the egg in awed silence, blinks a few times, then looks up at you.>D... did you see that?  Incredible!  My titan thing idea worked!  With your help, of course.We'll want to get this back to Rhea.  She's not at Lethlor Ravine anymore; it sounds like she blew her cover pretty well when she transformed into her true form in front of all those whelps.  She's now in the west, staying at an Alliance camp called Dragon's Mouth.She'll be waiting for you.  And for that egg."
1703,"It's Only Poisonous if You Ingest It : Take this cage, <class>. I've placed inside it one of my own mutant bush chickens, with a few slight modifications. Within the butt of this bush chicken is a stick of dynamite laced with gunk from the diseased organs you brought me.Take the cage out into the surrounding forest and locate the wandering forest ettin. Release the chicken and sit back as my masterwork does its job. The ensuing explosion should be sufficient to kill the ettin or greatly weaken it, allowing you to finish it off."
1704,"Mission Complete : We be done here, mon.  Only thing left to do is send a report to Okrilla.  You doin' anything right now?"
1705,"A Bloodmage's Gotta Eat Too : Contrary to popular belief, blood elf bloodmages do NOT drink blood.  We eat normal food like everybody else - something which can be hard to come by in the recesses of an ogre stronghold.The ashmane boars in the central valley of the Blasted Lands are, if nothing else, convenient for eating, as their meat does not require any cooking.  Would you hunt these boars and help us replenish our foodstores?"
1706,
1707,"A Strange Historian : That sword belonged to Joseph Redpath, Pamela's father - though you probably already knew that.  I wish Joseph could again be with his daughter, but it cannot be so.  His soul was twisted by the Scourge, and he became a monster.Pamela's fate is sealed, but perhaps we can change Joseph's fate.A strange gnome arrived here at this tower not long ago.  Her name is Chromie.  Take that sword to her.  I have a feeling she will be able to help us."
1708,"An Opportune Alliance : With your contributions to the food stores, my current assignment is complete.I will be heading north, to the Plaguewood, next.  I understand you may be headed in the same direction.Do you mind if I join you on the road?I will head northwest, to Eastwall Tower.  If you're interested in teaming up, you can meet up with me there."
1709,"Prove Yer Allegiance : Yer welcome to stay in Chiselgrip for a time, but I need to know that yer a friend.  So I've got a task for ye.We of the Thorium Brotherhood're not the only dark irons here in the steppes.  Far from it.  We're pretty badly outnumbered by the dark irons of Blackrock Mountain.  We've got a safe enough foothold here in Chiselgrip, but even so, they still pester us from as close as the Ruins of Thaurissan, to the north.Prove yerself, <race>.  Kill 'em for me."
1710,Peeking into the Portal : I sent Scout Pazaztick to be gettin' a better look at da portal. He shoulda reported back by dis time; what be taking him so long?Dis is what happens when you hire da goblins as help.
1711,"Kill Gil : Gilblins!<Larry stares at you silently for a while.>You never seen a gilblin before? They're crazy! Crazier than me! I just blow stuff up for a living, these guys are WHACKED!Dunno where they came from, but they're like awful fish goblins! Gills and everything! They wiped out all my men down at the beach, and they took our shipping freighter!You gotta help! They're just down to the east, go on and get rid of those gilblins!"
1712,"Chiselgrip, the Heart of the Steppes : We're headed to Chiselgrip, right in the center of these steppes.  We'll rendezvous with the Thorium Brotherhood there, as well as with my father.Are you familiar with the Brotherhood?  Those dark iron dwarves have helped me out more than once.  We may need their help again.We'll pass through Black Tooth Hovel on our way there.  What do you say we kill a few of the Blackrock while we travel?  I'm getting a little restless here in this camp."
1713,"Assault on Dreadmaul Rock : This is it, <name>.  A sad day... but a day in which the Blackrock orcs will learn a powerful lesson.  Today, our plan comes to fruition.Come with me.  We're going to go talk to Acride and call in that favor that he owes us.  Then we'll stop this invasion of Redridge before it even starts."
1714,"Supplies from Darkshire : Oh, what is a poor old man to do?  I need some supplies from Darkshire, but the village is so far away and I am so old and feeble...I would never make the trip.Can you go to Darkshire and bring me back some ghost hair thread?  You can get it from Madame Eva at her home on the Darkshire square."
1715,"Built to Last : My lady, I have a request from the High Priestess that I am to pass along to you. Many of the city's defenses remain from long before it sunk beneath the waves, and some of them are but a trivial task to reactivate, were it not for the countless Kvaldir that stand in our way.We are told you are to be fighting on Nar'shola Terrace above us. You would do my lady a great service if you would but touch some of the devices as you pass. Your noble blood should prove more than sufficient to reactivate them."
1716,"Sedimentary, My Dear : The destruction of the Stonewrought Dam was no small thing, <lad/lass>. We're here to find out just how bad the damage is. A mighty load of water's rampaged through here, and if it's disturbed the earth too far, we could be in for worse later on.We can tell a lot from studying the sediment of the flooded area. I need as many soil samples as I can get, so if you could head out there and collect some more, I'd much appreciate it."
1717,"Curse These Fat Fingers : Unfortunately, I can't dish out the beats like I used to, due to this here fat finger problem.  Ye see, the climate out here combined with the lack o' air pressure makes me fingers expand.  They're like gigantic Thelsamar Blood Sausages, they are...Ye're gonna have to carry out me orders of business and what have ye.First on me agenda: Poundin' the livin' daylights out o' the heavy war golems o' the Gorge.  Get crackin'."
1718,"The Coastal Menace : When my life was ended upon the rocks, I had no clue what the afterlife held for me.  The Lighthouse was black that night because Old Murk-Eye had scared the keeper's family off.  They returned and re-lit the flame but Old Murk-Eye coerced the weaker minded murlocs to raid the Lighthouse with him once again.  The second time the family was not so lucky and before my eyes they perished helplessly.Slay Old Murk-Eye if you see him along the shore and bring me one of his scales and I shall reward you."
1719,"Warchief's Command: Silverpine Forest! : All able-bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Grand Executor Mortuus at Forsaken High Command in Silverpine Forest.Now, more than ever, your help is needed in routing the enemy infestation of the region and conquering the port of Gilneas!To reach Forsaken High Command you must travel south through Tirisfal Glades and enter Silverpine Forest. From there, follow the road south until you reach Forsaken High Command. Destiny calls!"
1720,"Tarenar Sunstrike : As soon as we stopped, they made a bet about ""who could kill the most undead in five minutes.""It's been an hour, and I'm still waiting for them to come back.I saw Tarenar run off to the southeast.  Unfortunately, I can't leave the caravan here by itself.  If you end up traveling in that direction, could you find him and send him back to me?"
1721,"The Wrathcaster : One of the more vile members of the Scarlet Crusade, Mataus the Wrathcaster, lurks within the barracks' dungeon.  Undeath suits his dark manner.Were I younger and on the front lines, I'd run him through myself.  As things are, I'm left behind to lead our forces from the rear.  So I leave the pleasure to you."
1722,"The Universal Key : We're going to need something even stronger than those beefy <race> hands of yours to open this.  And the Venture Company schlubs to the northwest might have just the thing.Last time I was over there, I saw shredders walking around with giant rotating blades on their hands.  That's one way to open a box!If you can't find any shredders, you might also try the giant sawblade in their lumber mill, by the lake."
1723,"Last Stand : We've got a good chokepoint here, <name>.  Feel free to say a prayer if that's your sort of thing.Take courage and let's kill these mutts."
1724,"Decontamination : You've been down here in Gnomeregan for a long time, <name>, and it's amazing that you've survived and kept your wits so long! We need to get you out.Before we can send you to the surface to join the rest of the gnomes, you have to go through the decontamination process. Just head into the next room and board the Sanitron 500. It will do the rest! It shouldn't even hurt... much.When you're all done, check in with Technician Braggle and he'll make sure you get some suitable gear."
1725,"Dark Iron Scheming : A cadre of Dark Iron spies have taken over Ironband's Compound to the south, beyond Helm's Bed Lake. The mountaineers are normally able to keep them from getting into Dun Morogh, but everything is in disarray right now.The Dark Iron dwarves would be fools if they didn't take advantage of the chaos. We have to find out what they're planning and stop them before they do any damage.Will you see if you can discover what they're doing down at Ironband's Compound?"
1726,"Westfall Stew : Hello, dear. Welcome to our home. Hmm, you don't look like you're homeless. Have you come to help us? If so, you're just in time! I'm planning dinner for the young ones and need a few simple ingredients.If you could get me some okra, goretusk flanks and stringy fleshripper meat I can make my famous Westfall stew! You'll find all of the ingredients near our farm. Just be careful of the harvest watchers. They are merciless killers."
1727,Rheastrasza's Gift : Wait here.  I will retrieve the egg.
1728,"Agony Abounds : You have no doubt heard about the incident that transpired at the Wrath Gate in Northrend, yes? Due to those unfortunate events we are strictly forbidden from using the strain of life-shattering blight that we finally perfected. Now we have rules and regulations and other nonsense!They've given us some neutered version of the perfected blight and expect us to weaponize it.If I'm to get this crap functional I'll need several bags full of ferocious doomweed. You'll find it all over Silverpine."
1729,"Transdimensional Warfare: Chapter I : <Sylvanas hands you the signet ring.>Take the ring and make your way to Beren's Peril, southeast of here, located in a cave in the hills. Once there, search the cave for the portal to the pocket dimension that conceals the Ambermill magi.I will communicate with you through your thoughts, <name>. Once you have reached the portal I will give you your marching orders."
1730,"Doing It Like a Dunwald : They already left to hunt down the ettin that lead the attack on Dunwald. I asked them to at least give ya a chance to catch up, but I'm not sure waitin's in their blood.They made off towards the town square, in the center of the ruins. You should go join'm before ya miss out on all the fun."
1731,"Spirit of the Loch : I have no knowledge of any artifact that Cho'gall is crafting, but I think I know one that can help.Countess Verrall is the ancient spirit of Loch Verrall to the north. She has no love for the Twilight's Hammer, who have polluted her waters.Seek her for the wisdom that you seek."
1732,"Go Fletch! : We must always be prepared for battle, <name>.  Whether that battle is against the Forsaken in Andorhal, against the Scourge in the east, or against some yet-unknown foe is unknown.  What is known, is that we must be ready.We are low on arrows.  I can obtain the shafts and heads, but I still need feathers.  The birds that circle to the northwest typically molt this time of year.  Would you mind traveling out into the field and gathering some of these feathers for our camp?"
1733,"Boys Will Be Boys : As soon as we arrived here at Light's Shield Tower, those two lunkhead paladins ran off to Light's Hope Chapel.  It's still a ways away, but if we're going to follow Argus along his tour of the towers, this is about as close as we're going to get.Check in on them and make sure they're alright?  I know they can handle themselves, but still, it'd make me feel better to know that you were watching over them while I'm stuck here with the caravan."
1734,"Hero of the Sin'dorei : This is the beginning of a new chapter in the history of our race, <name>.  Our lands will be reclaimed and we shall cement our bond with Sylvanas and her allies.Take the traitor's head to Regent Lord Lor'themar Theron in Silvermoon City.  He'll be eager to hear the news."
1735,"A Fate Worse Than Butchery : The people of Terrordale, they were sick, then they turned bad.  Definitely not good times.The pigs, though... they also got sick!  What did pigs do to deserve to get sick?  Hah hah hah!  Nothing!People I can forget about, but the bad pigs still make me sad.  If you kill them, though... I might get happy."
1736,"Morgan's Vigil : Our work here in Chiselgrip is done, mostly thanks to you.  We'll now be moving on to the east, to Morgan's Vigil.Our intel indicates that Morgan's Vigil has been vacated, as most of its inhabitants have moved into Blackrock Mountain to fight their own battle against the Blackrocks.  It should serve as a sufficient base of operations for the final stages of our plan.Of course, Keeshan will be joining you on the road.  As will I."
1737,"Water Elementals : I arrived in Stranglethorn to study a feature known as the Altar of Naias, but made the unfortunate choice of denying Colonel Kurzen's advances, which earned me several years in that cage.  Now that I'm out, I figure I might as well continue with my original studies.The altar is on an island to the west, south of Zul'Kunda.  Gather some of the bracers from the island's water elementals.Oh, and you can use this device when you're finished.  No need to make you walk all the way back here."
1738,"Stopping Kurzen's Legacy : Now that our allies have been evacuated, it's time to run a final raid on Kurzen's Compound.  They will never be weaker than they are right now, and with your help, we may be able to weaken them beyond repair.Those four names that were listed in the Officers' Dossier - Anders, Gaulus, Miranda, and Esquivel - will be the highest-ranking personnel remaining.  Look for them in that cave in the back of their compound.  Removing all four will be devastating to Kurzen's forces.Go with honor, <name>."
1739,"Bloodscalp Insight : I never got to properly thank you for saving me.Thank you, <name>.I'm still a little fatigued from my captivity, so I thought you might help me with my studies.  As a shaman of the Wildhammer clan, I'm very interested in the shamanic practices of the Bloodscalp tribe.Their magic seems to have diverged in an interesting direction.  If I had one of the totems that their shaman use, I could begin my studies.  You'll find them at the Bal'lal ruins, on the coast to the southwest."
1740,"Hero's Call: Duskwood! : <name>, the citizens of Duskwood are in dire need of your assistance! I have here a letter from Commander Althea Ebonlocke, leader of the Night Watch, pleading for help.To reach Darkshire you should travel across the bridge located in the southwest corner of Redridge. Once you cross the bridge you will be in Duskwood. Then you just follow the road to Darkshire. Beware of the savage beasts that stalk the countryside!"
1741,"Skulk Rock Clean-Up : Years ago, there used to be a Horde base deep within Skulk Rock. It's been abandoned since then, but it's still prime territory, worth takin' for our allies!Problem is, it's full of dwarf-eating slimes and oozes. Those things are slightly less disgustin' than trolls, but they'll still give us a hassle.With our boys tied up fightin' the Revantusk, I need you to go to Skulk Rock and clear the place out for me."
1742,"The Shell of Shadra : The final piece is all we need to burn Shadra out for good.The Shell of Shadra is held by the spider god's last living high priestess, Qiaga the Keeper. She stands atop the Altar of Zul, guarded by other fanatical zealots.You've got to climb that altar to the top and take her out! She'll have the Shell in her possession. Bring it back here."
1743,"Buy Us Some Time : So many good men have been lost today. Without you, that number would be even higher.You have our gratitude.If what the shaman says is true, then there is no time to spare. The naga are scouring these waters looking for survivors.We are not yet ready to fight. You must buy us time to make preparations. Find the naga that hunt us and delay their efforts."
1744,"Pay It Forward : You are now able to move about this realm more freely and without fear of drowning.This is where our work begins.First, you have many allies nearby who are drowning as we speak. As I saved you, you must save them.I have enchanted the shell you brought me. Use it to rescue your friends.Hurry now!"
1745,"Girding Our Loins : As we struggled not to drown, my orcs and I were forced to abandon our weapons and much of our armor.Erunak says to expect a major attack from the naga soon and I believe him.If we're going to be victorious, we'll need your help to recover our lost equipment.You should find it scattered around the sea floor near our shipwrecks here and to the north.Make haste, <race>. The enemy could arrive at any moment."
1746,"Warm Welcome : I'm glad you're back! Saving the world or something, I'm sure.I was dispatched to establish relations with the red dragons in the area, but I'm finding this bunch somewhat less accommodating than the ones at Wyrmrest were. I have, however, been told that you are the type that solves problems.A problem solver as it were.Care to take a crack at earning a bit of trust with Lirastrasza at Vermillion Redoubt to the southwest? Anything that might soften her up a bit for me would be lovely."
1747,"Defending Fairbreeze Village : We've experienced a marked increase in Scourge attacks, <name>.  Our defenses are barely holding and there's no sign of reinforcements from Silvermoon City.  Lend us a hand in defending the village by thinning the numbers of the undead roaming the Dead Scar nearby."
1748,"Distract Them for Me : There are three candidates for Ascendancy that we need to eliminate: Dame Alys Finnsson, Master Klem, and Mia the Rose.I'd like for you to serve as my distraction. When the time is right, I'll step in and finish them off from behind.Whatever you do, <name>, do not underestimate them. Each got to where they are by being ruthless and very good at what they do."
1749,"The Bane of Many A Pirate : Gum disease.  It's a real problem, <race>.I know you're new and all, and probably haven't ever needed your gums cut, but the rest of us pirates have to deal with a little thing called SCURVY.  It's why we keep so many limes around here.Well... we used to keep limes around here.  Someone made off with our last shipment, but they can't have gone far - maybe to the nearby islands?  Bring them back, and maybe I'll see what I can do to get you promoted from swabbie."
1750,"Strategic Cuts : <Static> <name>... <name>, can you hear me?  It's Troteman.Listen, we've just received the final bit of intel for your next mission.  There are three marks that we'd like you to take down.  The first is Voodooist Timan, whom you'll find atop the Pillar of Ash.  Worgmistress Othana is in the central worg pens.  Finally, Gorlop is near the lava pools to the south.You will find the scorpid barbs you harvested packed along with your belongings.  Use the barbs on the marks when the time is right."
1751,"How to Maim Your Dragon : <You sling the gore-spattered gryphon corpse over your shoulder, its wings dragging to the ground.><Highland Black Drakes roost just southwest of the Crucible of Carnage, along a ring of low mountain peaks.><If you drop the gryphon corpse there, a drake is sure to start feeding. With its guard down, you should be able to attack it until it is weak enough to mount and fly.>"
1752,"The Assassin : <name>, we recently uncovered a plot to assassinate our envoy to Falcon Watch.  Hellfire Citadel learned of our plans to send an expedition there earlier this morning and set up an ambush.Our scouts have informed me that an assassin known as Krun Spinebreaker waits along the road north of the Citadel.  Go there and slay this assassin.  Show the fel orcs we're not to be trifled with!"
1753,"No One Here Gets Out Alive : This farm is under lockdown! Nothing gets in and nothing gets out! We're still assessing the situation to try and figure out exactly what happened, but my theory is that the laborers ate the mushrooms and somehow mutated into hideous undead monsters. I mean, how else could this have happened? This is just a farm! We grow mushrooms here! And sludge! Yes, sludge!Take a look around, <class>, because now that you're here you can't leave until this issue is resolved.See for yourself!"
1754,"To the Digsite : The other Darkspear emissary was here briefly.  He was eager to get to the next location and warn them.   I sent him on a flight to the Explorers' League Digsite in the Cape of Stranglethorn.  I hope he wasn't too late.I will give you use of one of my gryphons, a direct flight there.Talk to me when you are ready to go, <name>."
1755,"Fresh out of the Grave : <name>!Rise, <name>!Welcome back to the realm of the living.  With the blessing and power of the Dark Lady, I have freed you from death's grip.You are no slave, <name>.  You are free to follow whatever path you choose from here.  If you choose to serve the Dark Lady Sylvanas, I recommend you speak with Undertaker Mordo.  You will find him behind me, in the graveyard."
1756,"Strike the Earth! : In case you didn't notice, the land here in the Wetlands is pretty messed up. Floods, earthquakes... and on top of it all, even the ground's got a wild hair now.I never thought we'd be attacked by our own dig site, but sure enough, big chunks of it are now rampaging around trying to flatten any dwarf they see.You look like a strong, strapping young <race>... mind going down there and slapping some sense into the clods?"
1757,"We Are Not Alone : <Duarn closes his eyes, pauses, and nods.>Nespirah has just informed me that we are not the only people fighting inside of this shell.  A small group of Horde slaves has escaped and is currently fighting off the naga on the other side of the shell, up on the ledge that overlooks Nespirah's heart.Go find them, <name>, and see what help they can lend us.  With their aid, we may be able to rouse Nespirah from her torpor.I will remain here, should you need anything."
1758,"Bounty on Murlocs : The Stormwind Army has placed a bounty on murloc lurkers and foragers in Elwynn.  Slaughter them and bring Guard Thomas their torn murloc fins, and the Stormwind Army will reward you well.The murlocs have built a village at Stone Cairn Lake north of here, and another to the south where the stream forks."
1759,"The Ring of Mmmrrrggglll : The Grimscale murlocs have not been scared off by your efforts. But, I think I know what will send them packing, as well as get me some personal retribution.They have a murloc chieftain that calls itself Mmmrrrggglll. It wanders the Golden Strand south of the river inlet. The beast once slew a compatriot of mine, and now wears his ring in open defiance and mockery.Slay Mmmrrrggglll, and bring back my friend's ring. Then we shall see these monsters cowed!"
1760,Scalding Shrooms : We think that we have a use for the merciless ones that your friend from the cave delivered to us. But I need a preservative for it.Down below in the Scalding Chasm are some mushrooms with the properties that I need. Bring some back up to me and I'll see what I can do.
1761,"Bird Down! Bird Down! : While you were fighting along the coast, I spotted a gryphon tumble out of the clouds almost due west of here.It wasn't one of ours.Likely it belonged to one of the Wildhammer. I know that Kurdran wanted to establish contact with the lost Wildhammer clans as one of his primary objectives after taking the beach. I can't spare any more of my men to scout it out, but I can spare you. Find that downed Wildhammer!"
1762,"He Who Controls the Ettins : You've stumbled upon a gnoll document. The gnoll that wrote this propaganda is semi-literate:BROTHERS OF YOWLER, HEAR DIRTPAW! DIRTPAW GIVEN ORB FROM ORCS! DIRTPAW CONTROL ETTIN THINGS! DIRTPAW CRUSH HUMIES! COME GET DIRTPAW PAW-O-GRAPH IN RETHBAN CAVE. CAVE IS WEST, HIDDEN IN CANYON!<There's a paw print as the signature.><There also appears to be a bite taken out of the scroll.>You should probably investigate."
1763,"What I Do Best : I remember when I was young, I would sneak off into the Ghostlands and just beat up zombies for hours on end.  Nobody even PAID me.  I just did it.Now, look in front of you.  Those are some serious zombies.  I was just about to start beating them up, too.  Care to join me?"
1764,"Step Three: Prophet : All that yet stands between me and the temple is Prophet Jammal'an himself. He is the leader of the Atal'ai trolls here, a foul manipulator.Know that you do not face a mere crazed troll, <name>, but an instrument of forces beyond your darkest comprehension. Yet you do not fight alone; my strength and the will of the Green Dragonflight go with you.Proceed to the Den of the Caller, left through the Hall of Ritual, and then down into the Hall of Bones. At the bottom, you will find Jammal'an."
1765,Gasping for Breath : <name>!  I was on my way when it happened.No time to waste.  A good half of the town watch was in the area that collapsed.  Get in there and save as many as you can.Make sure to get them out of the water and onto shore.  I'll make sure they get any aid they need.
1766,"Knee-Deep : It's time to pack it in, <name>.  Most of our people have made it through -- it's your turn now.Take this torch, you're going to need it.  The tunnel is full of nasty, knee-biting critters of the worst kind.  Use it to keep them at bay.Speak to Krennan on the other side."
1767,"Roland's Doom : This isn't all of it...You should let it go, <name>. The only place left to look is Roland's Doom. That's the mine south of town, and the largest lair of worgen in Duskwood. Nobody in Darkshire has ever made it back from that place alive. In fact, some of the records I have here imply that's where the monsters first came from... who knows what evil's lurking in there?Please, <name>, just give it up. Let's just forget about this whole thing, and never speak of it again."
1768,"Eastpoint Tower : Our outpost in the southeast is having some problems. I don't have any details other than... well, let me just read from the latest letter:""The orcs have grown petulant. Send help or I will have them beaten with reeds.""That's it. It was sent from our chief psylosopher, Nils Beerot. Yea, I have no idea what that means either. Could you please head to Eastpoint Tower and find out what he needs? I can't take any more of these cryptic letters!Just head south and then follow the road east."
1769,"Grimaxe's Demise : With you leading the way, we've finally broken the momentum of the Dark Iron attack. General Grimaxe, the Dark Iron leader, is attempting to rally his troops from the center of their lines on the frozen lake to the south.He stands atop one of their new dark iron golems, shouting orders to his men. If he succeeds in rallying them, they may still be able to overpower us. You must prevent that, <name>. Destroy the golem guarding him, then kill General Grimaxe himself. He is the key to our victory."
1770,"License to Ride : The captain said you'd be coming here to pick up your mount. I hope you didn't have any problems finding the place!  Now, before you ride off into the sunset, you'll need to learn how to... well, how to ride! Luckily, we have a riding trainer right here!  Speak with Darlene Stokx when you're ready to learn how to ride."
1771,"Twisted Twilight Ties : Hansel and I came here on a secret mission: kill Overseer Maltorius.  While our main goal still remains the same - defeating Archduke Calcinder - it can't hurt to take out the infamous overseer of the Slag Pit while we're here.Problem is, Hansel was only prepared to fight one dwarf, but it looks like Maltorius has a visitor... an emissary from the Twilight's Hammer!Speak with Hansel and help him out.  Then proceed down this corridor and along the balcony outside to find Overseer Oilfist."
1772,"Good Deed Left Undone : G'day, <laddie/lassie>.The name's Rendel.Seems ol' Moanah and I got here in the nick of time, eh?Erunak wasn't kiddin' when he said it was life or death!So... in our rush ta git over here, we left a little unfinished business off to the east a ways.A little lady was near death herself. We had no choice but ta leave her by a little air vent when we came here to yer rescue.How bout yeh git over and help her while there's still time?"
1773,"Feeding the Hungry and the Hopeless : Yes, I heard about the Furlbrow murders. It is very tragic, but such tragedy is a way of life in Westfall. There are many people here who simply no longer have the means or inclination to keep themselves fed. They have given up hope. Do you understand what it means to be left so hopeless as to stop caring about life? We must work together to show them that there is hope. That with the dawning day a better life comes.Take my mother's Westfall stew and help feed the homeless around Sentinel Hill."
1774,"Easily Swayed : The most immediate threat to Fuselight is, without argument, the colony of ogres to the northwest.Most of our ogre neighbors used to be warrior-types, but it seems that more and more of them are practicing magic.  I won't have an army of ogre-magi at my doorstep.Go take out some of those Dustbelcher ogres.  Hopefully they'll get the picture and avoid messing with the might of Fuselight."
1775,"The Same, But Different : I'm beginning to suspect these here coins are demonic. See? This one's got three eyes! This one always comes up tails. And over here - the ones you brought me earlier? They dissolved in holy water.I need to make absolutely sure this isn't a fluke - bring me a huge pile of coins to sort through so nobody can refute m'theory."
1776,Warchief's Command: Badlands! : All able bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Gek Nozzlerocket at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands.The Alliance is desperate to gain a foothold in the Badlands. Your duty will be to keep them at bay and learn about the destruction wrought by Deathwing.Gek has agreed to provide transportation to the Badlands by rocket. Meet with him at Light's Hope Chapel.Destiny calls!
1777,The Waters Run Red... : <The communication console hums.>Those worgen you killed were the scouting party. There are hundreds more incoming! Looks like Crowley and Bloodfang made the blood offering to every human in Lordaeron.Get in one of those Horde cannons and send them all back to their makers. Let the waters of Lordamere Lake run red with their blood!
1778,"Bravo Company Field Kit: Chloroform : The first part of this mission is all covert ops, <name>. To that end, we need to be able to incapacitate the enemy without making any sounds. To do that we're going to need chloroform.The muckdwellers at the bottom of Lake Everstill hold chloroform in their glands. I'm going to need you to go underwater and recover muckdweller glands. Think you can handle it?Come back to me once you've recovered enough glands.Where's the lake you ask? Open your eyes, dummy. Directly west."
1779,"The Amulet of Allistarj : When my master helped me to take my eyes out, he gave me the gift of sight... a sight much greater than yours, or even of these blood-craving elves.  My sight allows me to see objects of demonic power, such as the Amulet of Allistarj.Allistarj himself is dead, but he locked his amulet up in a trove inside the Serpent's Coil, to the east.  Along with the other amulets, this relic will give us access to Razelikh's perch."
1780,"Forgotten Rituals : Every year we, the denizens of Suncrown Village, would take part in a ritual to keep the different aspects of nature under our control.  Dominion over the element of water was symbolized by the summoning and enslavement of an elemental named Aquantion.  Through a wicked perversion of our magic, the scoundrel broke his bonds and enslaved us instead!We wore medallions shaped like waves during the ritual.  Seek them at the bottom of the lake; we'll need them to free my compatriots' spirits!"
1781,"The Traitor's Shadow : Dar'Khan Drathir is believed to have returned from the dead to rule over the armies of the Scourge in the Ghostlands.  Dar'Khan aligned himself with the Scourge long ago... yet he was once a living, breathing elf.  Much of his time was spent inside Dawnstar Spire, northeast of here.  He hid there for many nights, scheming against his own. Search the tower for more information, <name>.  Perhaps he had a journal or kept notes.  One never knows where useful information might present itself."
1782,"Beat it Out of Them : We paladins are normally taught to exercise judgment and control when dealing with foes, but this is an emergency, and I never paid too much attention to my trainers anyhow.I'm going to head into the Plaguewood and find out what I can about Giddy.  You deal with the Scourge just to our northeast, on the other side of this tower.  The undead don't fear death, but if you beat them enough, their tongues might slip, and we may get some clues to Gidwin's location."
1783,"You Can Take the Murloc Out of the Ocean... : I need something to cut into the raw, elemental power of these bracers... something strong and abrasive, but still of the sea.The Murkgill murlocs have moved inland from the sea, but they still carry vials of sea salt on them.  What they use it for, I can't be sure, but it will serve for our studies.  You can find the Murkgill in the glade south of the Rebel Camp and east of Bal'lal ruins."
1784,"Defend Grom'gol : I hope you like to fight, <name>.  Your troll friend has been through here and warned us that the Gurubashi were on the rampage.  I never thought the battle would be this glorious though.Come, join in our fight and let's show these Gurubashi trolls the might of the Horde!"
1785,"Helm's Deep : This helm and its associated components are marked with the seal of Stormwind. It was no doubt cast off from an Alliance ship that suffered a similar fate to yours.Looking closer, this seems far too intricate and sturdy to be everyday diving equipment. Perhaps Nazgrim can make some sense of this..."
1786,"A Breath of Fresh Air : Captain Taylor and many of the other survivors have already made their way to the surface. I'm sure some are just looking to rid themselves of this place for good, but we still have work to do if we're going to stop the naga from invading the plane of water.First, we need to set eyes on the tentacled fiend that destroyed our ships when we first arrived - we don't want a repeat of that nightmare.Hexascrub left these behind for you. They should speed your trip up a bit."
1787,"Even Dragons Bleed : I won't be so impolite as to refuse your aid if you're offering it.We're locked in constant battle with the twilight drakes and dragons to the south. Our strikes have not been entirely without success, but the dragons coming out of Grim Batol have been breathing some kind of corruption upon us that takes time to cleanse.Velastrasza and Baleflame are attending to our injured brothers. Go and see if you can be of help to them."
1788,"Amakkar, Jack of All Trades : Before we get too crazy with the dragon-killing, let me tell you a little bit about how I fight.I'm not terribly strong or stalwart like these other two, but I've got a few tricks.  At your command I'll stun your enemies to keep 'em held still.  I also make sure to keep a few potions around for tight spots.Why don't we practice fighting together?  Head out into the field, and you can see what it's like to fight with a real orc."
1789,"In Search of Bravo Company : If you and Keeshan are going to defend Lakeshire, we're going to need to find his old battalion. Last I heard all of 'em - Messner, Jorgensen, Krakauer and Danforth - were captured by the Blackrock orcs. Now I don't know where they could possibly be or if they're even alive, but I'd be a damned fool if I didn't ask you to try and find 'em.Search Alther's Mill, east of here, for any clues."
1790,"The Menders' Stead : I don't like the looks of what the Forsaken are doing here at the Bulwark.  Bombs, cauldrons, needless bloodshed... none of these embody that which the Argent Crusade stands for.  Furthermore, I don't like the fact that they employ mercenaries like yourself.Nothing against you personally, <class>.  It's just that you could be doing so much more for yourself.  If you're interested in healing the plaguelands, rather than re-plaguing them, then report to Field Agent Kaartish at the Menders' Stead to the east."
1791,"Quae Trusts You : <Quae begins to go through the folder.>Expansion...control of territory... these undead aren't cooking up anything new, but they're planning to roll over all of Arathi. We need to disrupt their plans.I'll keep a lookout from up here. You go with Kin, and get those invasion plans. We're not going to let these walking corpses even know what day it is out here.And keep her safe, you hear me?"
1792,"Panther Prowess : Now the hard part.  As panthers grow older, they become more wily, blending in with their environment and becoming difficult to spot.  These cunning panthers are known by the name ""shadowmaw"", for their tendency to suddenly appear out of the darkness... with a waiting mouth full of teeth.If you want to prove yourself as a true panther hunter, shadowmaws are the only way to do so.  They prowl to the southeast, across the river."
1793,"See Raptor : We have the feathers, yes.We have the <class>, yes.Speak with Priestess when you are ready."
1794,"Marking the Fallen : Many warriors have met death to bring us victory, <name>. The fate of a true orc.I have seen the way the Alliance loots the bodies of our fallen, clutching at our goods like packrats. They will not defile our fallen heroes on this field.Take these wards with you to the Bloodmire. Place them on the bodies of our fallen warriors. I will be watching, to see how many have fallen, and to honor their sacrifice. Let us hope the spirits give us aid for our respect."
1795,"Krazzworks : This new shredder design is tops, <name>. Tops! Next step is to protect my intellectual property. There are patents to file, traders to mark, ceases to desist. Oh, and the bribes!Here, take this patent application to Captain Krazz at the Krazzworks. He survived the destruction of his zeppelin, so he's probably hungry for new business opportunities.The Krazzworks is due north of here, atop a perfectly safe mountain peak. Go ahead, kid. Chop chop!"
1796,"Stormpike Apocalypse : Before we continue, let us have a moment of silence for our fallen brother, Orkus, for without him, we would have been destroyed by the Stormpike onslaught. This is for you, brother!<Cromush takes a knee.>Now, <name>, do not think that I forgot your part in all of this! That is why you get the honors of detonating the goblin pocket-nukes.Are you ready? FOR THE HORDE!"
1797,"Lockdown in Anvilmar : We appreciate yer help out here, but there may be a place where they need ye even more.Due to the trogg attacks - not to mention that massive earthquake we just had - we're putting all civilians on lockdown inside Anvilmar, just up the hill to the northwest.Go an' talk to me wife, Jona, inside Anvilmar.  I'm certain she's in need of an able-bodied <man/lass> such as yerself."
1798,Something's Amiss : The lieutenant appears to have died from severe wounds.  The prince might want to hear this news.You hear the sound of fighting coming from the market.
1799,"Soothing Spirits : This is a tragic land, with a history of violence and despair. While many of the dead roam in the flesh, some are simply lost souls, wandering in confusion.They deserve to be put at ease.Many of these souls gather at the Addle Stead to the south, appearing before travelers. Take this censer of holy incense. Sway it before the forlorn spirits, and let the offering of its gentle scent give them peace."
1800,"Reinforcements for Loch Modan : I've been waiting for the council to hear my plea for hours, and it's not looking good. Moira's greatest desire seems to be to paralyze the council.Meanwhile, Loch Modan suffers. Our enemies are many and our resources are few. Please, <name>, perhaps you will hear me if the council will not. Speak to Gryth Thurden, Ironforge's gryphon master. He's in the eastern part of the Great Forge. He'll provide a free flight to the South Gate Pass. Introduce yourself to Pilot Hammerfoot once you arrive."
1801,"Meet with Evelyn Thorn : I just received a scroll from Evelyn Thorn in Stormwind. She wants you to pay a visit to the Training Hall in Stormwind. She doesn't mention specifics, but I got the impression that it was a matter of some importance."
1802,"Operation Recombobulation : I should go back to Gnomeregan and continue researching a cure for irradiated gnomes.But, I stayed behind in Kharanos because the town is my home and I wanted to help defend it from the Frostmane attacks. I've been working on maintaining and repairing the steam tanks.For some reason, Frostmane scavengers have taken a liking to the gyromechanic gears I need to complete the repairs. They're all over the Frostmane Front to the southeast of town. Will you help me get those gears back?"
1803,"Slave Labor : It will take me some time to break through this barrier and communicate with Nespirah.  In the meantime, you can save some of those men that the naga have enslaved in the pits below.<Duarn produces a length of rope from within his robes.>This should come in handy."
1804,"DUN-dun-DUN-dun-DUN-dun : If ol' Gnaws had heels he'd be on 'em right now.Fortunately for you, I think like a shark.Gnaws is mad as all get out and we're gunna use that to our advantage.Here, I found this chain while out treasure-huntin'. Use it to tie off to that harpoon gun.When Gnaws sees ya he'll be consumed with rage - that's when we strike!You try to finish him off and I'll sneak in there and grab the shiney.Hurry, <class>, before he grows them teeth back!"
1805,"The Family Crypt : The strongest point in the mills is the Agamand Family Crypt.  With necromancy, Captain Dargol has raised the ancestors of the Agamands and plans to use them against us.This cannot pass, and you must stop it.  Travel to the Agamand Family Crypt and defeat the raised Agamand ancestors."
1806,"A Somber Task : These are difficult times for us, <name>.  It was a very hard decision to burn the woods bordering the Ghostlands to prevent the Scourge's expansion.The treants, who have been our friends for years, are now trying to foster the regrowth of the forest along the Scorched Grove.This is a painful thing to ask of you, <class>, but we've failed to convince our former allies to cease their endeavors.  I need you to stop them by the only means that remain to us: force."
1807,Prisoners : The Twilight cultist dropped this key. Use it to free the Alliance prisoners in the cages inside of L'ghorek.Hurry before the prisoners become sacrifices to whatever lurks below!
1808,"Detonation : Those explosives you planted were high yield, <name>. When I push this button on the Bravo Company field kit, that whole valley is gonna be consumed by a massive fireball of death.You know, I think you should do the honors. You did all the hard work, after all.Ready?"
1809,"Strange New Faces : Now that Felstone is ours, we can use its acreage - and any dead bodies we find - for our own purposes.  I've received orders from higher up that you are going to be helping out in this process.You may have met Lindsay Ravensun on the battlefield in Andorhal.  I've never met her before, but she seems to have made some friends in high places, because she's taking over operations at Felstone.  You're to meet her at the charred Scarlet camp... the one you scouted out earlier."
1810,"Victors' Point : You've more than proved your intent and your abilities. With Grim Batol cut off and the black dragons routed, the Twilight's Hammer are cornered in their Citadel.Go to your leaders. You should find them northwest, at Victors' Point. Let them know that when the attack on the Twilight Citadel begins, the red flight shall fill the skies above. You may not be able to atone for all of the sins your allies have committed, but in this one battle, we shall be by your side.The Twilight's Hammer will fall."
1811,
1812,"The Bogpaddle Bullet : I've heard stories about a road to the Swamp of Sorrows.  Mysterious tales of a meandering mountain pathway that completely bypasses Redridge and poops you right out into Bogpaddle!If you run out of things to do, I suppose you'll have to leave.  And we'll all be sad.  When you do leave, talk to Sharon Boomgetter in the southeastern corner of the Steppes.  She'll give you a ride.<Oralius tilts his head, as if listening to something.>Winky?  WINKY!  NO!"
1813,"Take Back What's Ours : Ever since the Forsaken invaded Gilneas, we've tried to keep the location of the Scythe of Elune secret.   We moved it at night to one of many safe locations.  The Dark Rangers got close, but never found it... until now.They were last spotted at the Woods' End Cabin, west of here.  Blow this horn when you find them and Tobias and his trackers will engage the Dark Rangers.Only then will it be safe for you to venture inside the cabin and take back the scythe.  Hurry, <name>.  It must not reach Sylvanas."
1814,"A Pearl of Wisdom : This pearl is unlike anything you've ever seen before. It radiates light, and if you are not mistaken, it radiates powerful magic as well.Earthmender Duarn back in Silver Tide Hollow will surely be interested in this."
1815,"Not Soon Forgotten : The Kvaldir leader has shown his rotting, ugly face but a short swim from here, down this hall to our west. We kill him now and the Kvaldir occupation of our once beloved city shall be ended.Beware Battlemaiden, for he is no weakling. He has many Kvaldir at his command. Some Sira'kess Sea Witches have been dispatched to weaken him during your attack, but they will be interrupted if you let any of his Kvaldir attack them.Show no mercy, Battlemaiden."
1816,"Decompression : I simply cannot bear the thought of so many others like this warrior imprisoned, surrounded by naga.Something must be done to rescue them!Try this, <name>. Use  it on the prison cells to make them buoyant.If we can get them to the surface, at least they stand a chance at being rescued."
1817,"Deactivating the Spire : As you may know, Magister Duskwither sent me back here to shut down the power sources that feed the Spire. There are three of them, each located in a different place inside.Unfortunately, I appear to be too late, and Duskwither Spire has been overrun with strange, magical creatures. While I haven't the expertise to accomplish this task, surely a <class>, such as yourself, could do so easily?"
1818,"The Northern Flank : I have ordered a defensive perimeter set up on our northern coast, at the Slithering Cove. Our scouts reported that the naga were trying to make landfall there.Gralok is in charge of the operation - report to him and secure that beach!"
1819,"They Drew First Blood : Take this bundle of Keeshan's possessions and head back to the Lakeshire inn basement. Bravo Company is already there, talking to Keeshan. Remind him of who drew first blood, <name>. Lakeshire needs Keeshan. The Alliance needs Keeshan.Dismissed, soldier!"
1820,"Who Needs Cauldrons? : Have you seen the condition of Felstone Field?  The Alliance forces at Andorhal have taken the area, and they're using it to... to... to grow CROPS!I almost liked it better when the Scourge held the area.  At least they had the sense to put a giant plague cauldron in the middle of the field.We're going to take that farm back from these humans, <name>.  Take these drums and place them at key locations around the field.  I'll be waiting here at the Bulwark."
1821,"Tomber's Supplies : How am I supposed to supply the war effort when I cannot even safely get my supplies here? I was promised an escort that never came. And then, I had to leave one of my carts behind to the west when I was attacked by a band of ghouls!Want to help out, and get me open for business in the process? Go down the western road out of town and past the graveyard. On the other side of the Dead Scar is a fork in the road. The hill that my cart had to be left on lies just beyond."
1822,"Swabbing Duty : I want the surface of the Riptide t'shine like a star ruby, Swabbie <name>.  I keep a tight ship around here, and it's swabbies like you that make it happen!Well, what're y'waitin' for, y'cockle-brained bilgerat?  Head updecks and start swabbin'!"
1823,"Raptor Hunting : So you think your hunting skills are in tip-top shape?  I can put them to the test in a jiffy.  Head out into that jungle and kill ten Stranglethorn raptors.  We'll see just how much of a big game hunter you are.And no, I won't tell you where you can find them!  Locating the beasts is half the challenge.Okay, go west."
1824,"Too Big For His Britches : Whatever it is you want to do: I've got a recipe that'll do exactly that.  You want an exploding potion?  BOOM!!  You want a lightning potion?  ZAP!!  You want a shrinking potion?  Smeerp.So Bronwyn says he wants a carbon-dating potion?  Easy.  I could make that in my sleep.  The thing is... if we want it to be accurate, I need you to get some quality ingredients.Start with some humour from a basilisk to the north.  It'll need to be a pretty big basilisk..."
1825,"Join the Battle! : I received an urgent message from Sergeant Willem. Turns out that the Blackrock orcs have hired goblin assassins. They ambushed our battalion behind the abbey. Willem has asked me to send him a hero. You have to go help them, <name>!Find Sergeant Willem north of the abbey at the command tent. Go!"
1826,"Last Stand at Thundermar : I'll hand it to you and your Alliance friends. You've really worked the Dragonmaw over!Many of their riders are dismounted but they're still coming at us, and my defenders will be overrun without help.Kill Dragonmaw Skyclaws on foot and Thundermar will forever be in your debt!"
1827,"Fear No Evil : Have you embraced the Holy Light yet, <brother/sister>? It is through the Holy Light that we are saved! It is through the Holy Light that I am able to heal these overly demanding soldiers! And it is through the Holy Light that you will be able to venture out into the field to the north and rescue our fallen brothers!Take this prayer book with you into the field and cast the Light's healing touch on the injured."
1828,"Bloodlord Mandokir : <race>.  You just resurrected your worst nightmare.  You didn't think I was a friend, did you, <race>?  Ah, ha ha haaaa!You've served your purpose.  I've returned to the realm of the living, and it's all thanks to you.  So, instead of killing you, I'm going to make you a deal instead.Give me that raptor.You must already know that she's no normal raptor, and I need a replacement for Ohgan.  Do it, or both you and the gnome will taste my rage."

1832,"Cloth and Leather Armor : For your shrewdness and valor, I have a marker here that is good for one piece of armor.  I want you to take it to Sara Timberlain at the Eastvale Logging Camp.  Give her the marker, and she will fashion the armor for you.  And after you receive it, <name>, use it in the defense of Elwynn.Eastvale is just east of this post across the bridge."
1833,"Fiends from the Netherworld : The ogre magi within the Undershell have summoned protectors for themselves: fleshling fiends from the netherworld.We cannot risk these aberrations from being later used against our forces. While you are in there, I want you to destroy as many of those things as you can."
1834,"Thieving Little Monsters! : The long stretch of coastline directly south of our position that extends from west to east is known as the Western Strand. Along the Western Strand you will find two things: murlocs and our stolen ""supplies.""<Keyton puts his hands in the air and makes quotation marks with his fingers.>Those damned thieving murlocs struck while our backs were turned and took our ""supplies.""Sarus and I cannot leave this post. We need you to head to the Western Strand and recover those ""supplies!"""

Though there are hundreds of Stormpike trainees there, one of my banshees will disguise you to look like one of the humans captured earlier, allowing you to walk freely among the enemy.Enter the Headland and find the Stormpike instructors. Once found, coerce them into attacking you! When they attack, kill them. With their instructors dead, they will be unable to train more soldiers!"
1838,"Sacrifices : You don't have to do this, <name>.  You've done more than enough already.But if you decide to stay... I'd be a fool to turn you away.My men have fortified their position inside the cathedral and are ready for what comes next.I'm about to head there and take as many of these flea-ridden devils with me as I can.  You're welcome to come along for the ride."
1839,Fallen But Not Forgotten : That was a disaster! Most of our men went down to spears before making it anywhere near the rendezvous.We're only going to be able to hold this position for so long before the naga overrun us. We need to get out there to the southwest and save as many of the men as we can find - do anything you can.They won't last long. Please hurry!
1840,"Thelsamar Blood Sausages : There's never a shortage of empty bellies here in Thelsamar, kids running in and out, workers from the excavation coming in after a hard day's work. We're famous for our blood sausages, I don't suppose you've ever tried them?No? Well, around here you've got to work for your meals, and don't think just because you're a fancy <class>, you'll be any exception.You get me some fresh bear rumps and leave the cooking to me!"

It's a piece of significant surveying equipment!I didn't name the bloody thing, alright? Go look it up! All I did was leave it on a rock long enough for one of those horrible oozes to swallow it up. The place is crawling with 'em, but one of them should still have it inside."
1842,"You Have Our Thanks : It's been many years since anyone has offered to lend us aid, <name>. Had you not come along, we might not have made it through the coming winter. You have proven yourself to be a selfless individual - a person that we can trust. I only wish we had something of value to offer you.While I have no information to assist you in your crusade to bring the Furlbrow's murderer to justice, perhaps my wife can help. Speak to Salma inside and she will tell you what you need to know before you leave."
1843,"The Angerfang Menace : When we hauled up here to get away from the raptors, we put ourselves right next to a whole slew of Dragonmaw orcs!I've heard the stories in Menethil, how the Dragonmaw are even cruder barbarians than other orcs, how they strangle black dragons with their bare hands... I don't know how much of it's true, but I know we can't just let 'em sit up here in the hills.You've got the chops for it, <name>. Head east to the Angerfang Encampment, take care of those orcs, and make sure you get their leader!"

1845,"A Little Oomph : <Dithers samples his latest concoction.>Hmm... this isn't quite there.  It needs something to give it a little more zing.  I've got it!  The spiders to the north have a potent venom that'll do the trick.  See if you can extract some for me, <name>?"
1846,Gordo's Task : Master want weeds. Us gots big hands and not good at picking. You help us and we not hurt you. Us need gloom weed. Many weeds around here and near road.When you have gloom weed you take to Master Holland in Brill.

1848,"The Brotherhood of Light : The Brotherhood of Light has a history of brash, thoughtless decisions.  They bridged a gap between the Scarlet Crusade and the Argent Dawn.  They were among the first to plunge into Northrend, while many of us lingered behind.However, they also have a history of getting results, which I respect.  They fight on two fronts now: one battle in Stratholme, and another, more immediate battle to the south at Tyr's Hand.I suggest you speak with Angela Dosantos at Tyr's Hand.  You may be of service."
1849,"Beating Them Back! : So you're the new recruit from Stormwind, eh? I'm Marshal McBride, commander of this garrison. Glad to have you on board...<McBride looks through some papers.><name>. It is <name>, right?You've arrived just in time. The Blackrock orcs have managed to sneak into Northshire through a break in the mountain. My soldiers are doing the best that they can to push them back, but I fear they will be overwhelmed soon.Head northwest into the forest and kill the attacking Blackrock worgs! Help my soldiers!"
1850,"The Mosh'Ogg Bounty : Say... have you heard about the ogres?  I got a hot tip from some fella' named Mok'thardin that some <race> schmuck in a ridiculous <class> getup found this ogre hand, and...<Skeezy trails off as he looks you over.>What was I just saying?  Oh yes... some <SWASHBUCKLING HERO/BREATHTAKING HEROINE> found this ogre hand, and Mok'thardin thinks it means that the ogres have some special artifact.  I've seen them guarding a chest up in some ruins behind their mound.  Care to fetch it for me?"
1851,"The Kirthaven Summit : After the licking we just gave 'em, the Dragonmaw assaults on Thundermar ought to stop. Maybe the Wildhammer do have a place in your Alliance - we Thundermars certainly owe you a debt.Up in Kirthaven, our Grand Shaman Lachlan MacGraff has been trying to arrange a summit between the surviving Wildhammer family leaders. It's a tall order to get us all to work together, but I'm at least willing to give it a go.Fly up to Kirthaven in the North and talk to Lachlan MacGraff. I'll meet you there!"
1852,"Clawing at the Truth : This can't be. My brother was strong-willed, but such vileness... such sickness and violent, bloody evil...<Tobias brings a hand to his face, averting his gaze.>I must have answers. I need to know how I got that letter. I need to know if Stalvan really did this.I need to know why...Take my ring, <name>. Bring it to Madame Eva. That woman is a follower of old arts and makes no secret of it... call it madness, but I'll try anything at this point."
1853,A Distraction for Akama : <Xi'ri pulses with lights as the Aldor and Scryer forces around him respond to his orders.  Xi'ri's army is ready to push Illidan's forces back and create a distraction for Akama.  The naaru awaits your request to begin the attack.>
1854,"The Great Netherwing Egg Hunt : Should you discover any Netherwing eggs while exploring, bring them to me.Be warned, a Netherwing egg is a rare discovery. Do not become frustrated if you cannot locate one. These Dragonmaw have been very thorough in collecting most of them and shipping them off to parts unknown.Eggs might be found on creatures of the island, near crystal formations, in the mines, or even inside a nethercite node or netherdust bush.Keep a low profile. We don't need Mor'ghor catching wind of your actions."
1855,"A Slow Death : The Dragonmaw have peons stationed at nearly every crystal formation up here. While the outright slaying of them would draw far too much unwanted attention to you, there is a way that we can thin their numbers and remain below the suspicious eyes of Mor'ghor.Venture into the wilds of Shadowmoon Valley and slay the tainted wildlife. Take from them their corrupt fel glands. Use those fel glands with this mutton that I'll give you near the peons. They'll take one bite and fall deathly ill!"
1856,"Netherdust Pollen : A flower picker?! Hilarious... Unfortunately, our mages and shaman need your services. The netherdust bushes that grow on this ledge have special pollen that is apparently very useful in their magical dealings. Bring me that stuff and I'll consider your work order complete."
1857,The Not-So-Friendly Skies... : On the northeast edge of this island exists a dock used for the packaging and transport of Netherwing crystals and relics. Dragonmaw Transporters transport the goods from the dock to Dragonmaw Fortress while Dragonmaw Ascendants guard the ground from any would-be attackers.This leaves one opening for you to make a strike at the Dragonmaw: The Dragonmaw Skyway.Fly to the shattered islands of the Dragonmaw Skyway and ambush the transporters that use the route. Recover our stolen relics!
1858,"Nethermine Flayer Hide : A skinner, eh? Well you'll find plenty to skin here! You gotta search for flayers around crystal formations. Take 'em down and take their hides. Sometimes they'll have a hide worth keepin'. Bring those to me."
1859,"Kindness : Something has them spooked, <race>.<Mordenai points to the nether drakes flying overhead.>They won't even come down to feed. I have seen several fall to the earth, dead from exhaustion before their bodies hit the ground.We must save them! The Rocknail flayers that are found near the crystals are their natural prey. Kill flayers and take their carcasses. Place a carcass in the field and stand extremely still. As long as you do not make any aggressive motions, they will not attack you."
1860,"Crazed and Confused : Don't worry about this dragon, <name>. We've got plans for it...Deeper in this mine is a band of crazed Murkblood. After the dragon broke out, they were cut off from the exit. Somehow, after a mere 2 days of isolation, they've lost all sense of decency.They've resorted to cannibalism and the promotion of mayhem. We don't need that kind of madness in this place. Find 'em and kill 'em. All of 'em."
1861,
1862,"A Job Unfinished... : In the name of our great master... For the glory of Illidan!By order of Overlord Mor'ghor, the great plateau of Netherwing Ledge is to be secured. With all Netherwing drakes captured or forced off of the land, rock flayers are running rampant and threatening crystal harvesting operations.Destroy them all, their den mother and her consort, Arvoar.Mor'ghor commands it!<It would appear that this orc failed to take the plateau. It is time to prove your worth to Mor'ghor!>"
1863,"Overseeing and You: Making the Right Choices : So you're the new overseer, eh? Well there's one thing any good overseer needs and that's the proper disciplinary weapon. Before you can go out there and knock some sense into these peons you need to have your ""piece."" Each overseer has to gather the materials required to make their own ""piece"" and you'll be no different.I'll need knothide leather and the hardened hide of Tyrantus. You'll find Tyrantus in Eco-Dome Farfield, located in the northern reaches of Netherstorm."
1864,"Nethercite Ore : A miner!<Varkule salutes.>An orc after my own heart! That's how Varkule got his start - minin'! There ain't nothin' better than getting down and dirty in the mines, is there?Now get out there and find those nethercite deposits. Strip 'em for all their worth and bring me back the ore."
1865,Ally of the Netherwing : Allow me to return you to Mordenai. I am certain that he wishes to see you once more.
1866,"Dragonmaw Race: Captain Skyshatter : You dare challenge Skyshatter? The world around you will fall into darkness as the heavens are torn asunder by my meteors.You stand no chance, soldier. Yet it is your desire to die...I will entertain this morbid obsession if only to prove a point to any that might foolishly dream of making the same mistake.We ride when you are ready!"
1867,"The Cipher of Damnation : How many times has this spell has been used in the history of our worlds? Undoubtedly, its power for destruction is unparalleled.What you must do now is take the cipher, now made whole, and read from it at the Altar of Damnation - where the memory of Gul'dan stands.What you will see once the words are uttered are the memories left imprinted upon the land. Stand your ground and await the coming of Cyrukh.You must be victorious, <name>. This land can not withstand another shattering."
1868,"The Soul Cannon of Reth'hedron : Reth'hedron now lords over the Twilight Ridge of Nagrand. An eredar of such power being loosed upon this world does not bode well for the Illidari. Alas, we do not have the resources required to slay Reth'hedron. Not with the war the bastards have brought to the Black Temple. No... I have a better plan.You will subdue Reth'hedron, banishing him back through the Twilight Portal. For this a soul cannon must be fashioned.Return to me with the materials on this list."
1869,Netherwing Crystals : No good at nothin'? That's fine. Even lunkheads like you can be used around here. Just find creatures on the ledge and kill 'em. Sometimes they'll have nether crystals on their carcasses. Gather those and bring 'em back to me and I'll consider your work order for the day complete.
1870,"Ar'kelos the Guardian : Now that you've gathered all the items I'll need to break Kael'thas's curse, one thing remains to be done. When Kael'thas sealed the tower, he placed an arcane golem, known as Ar'kelos, at the bottom of the tower.You must defeat Ar'kelos in order allow me to work magic within the tower again.When you enter the Violet Tower, the curse will begin to affect you.Once you have defeated Ar'kelos, ascend the tower and assist me in making preparations for the ritual."
1871,"Divination: Gorefiend's Armor : In life, Gorefiend was a bastard, but in death, Gorefiend was an unmitigated terror.To the southeast you will find Netherwing Ledge. What was once part of the mainland of Shadowmoon is now a floating island in the sky.Vhel'kur, spawn of Deathwing, once called it his home, but now knows it as his grave. He flies an endless circle above the island, seething at his defeat to Gorefiend.If you are to recover the Gorefiend's armor, it is Vhel'kur that you must defeat."
1872,WANTED: Annihilator Servo! : WANTED:  1 Annihilator Servo to replace the failing one in my Long Neck Spectrum Analyzer.You and your friends might want to check with the blood elves at Manaforge B'naar to the west to see if they have any spares.  They seem to have a few arcane annihilators roaming about.Please deliver the servo in pristine condition to Papa Wheeler at Area 52.
1873,"In Service of the Illidari : Netherwing Ledge... What was once a bastion of sanctuary for the Netherwing is now home to the Dragonmaw. While the orcs may have control of our territory, our magic there is still strong. Strong enough to cloak your true identity and allow you to infiltrate the ranks of Dragonmaw.I have prepared this letter for you to present to their leader, Overlord Mor'ghor. Fly headlong into the maw of our enemy and seek out Dragonmaw Base Camp to start your new life as a fel orc of Illidan Stormrage."
1874,"Burning Crusade: Through the Dark Portal : For 20 years the Dark Portal has remained a silent monument - a eulogy to a time long since forgotten.<Relthorn looks around.>I never thought to see this day, yet here we stand, looking into the abyss.On the other side of this gate we are locked in a savage war - a war that we cannot win without support. You must go through the Dark Portal and help our troops, <class>.Report to Commander Duron at once. He awaits you in Outland..."
1875,"Report to Spymaster Thalodien : Some time ago, Voren'thal dispatched a small team to Netherstorm to investigate the activities of Kael'thas. Our leader has the utmost confidence in Spymaster Thalodien and his compatriots, and has decided to honor his request for reinforcements.Thalodien's report was brief, but clear that he's encountered something of great importance. Report to him at Area 52 and assist him in any way possible, <name>."
1876,"Whispers of the Raven God : At Grishnath, totems left by the Oracles of the Raven enable the arakkoa to hear the Word of the Raven. Unfortunately, the language of the arakkoa is indecipherable to us.Using the Harbinger's pendant, we can understand it. You will be able to take the souls of the arakkoa to understand their language. While you are suffused with the arakkoa's spirit, you can visit the totems and understand their message.Discover this for us, <name>."
1877,"Zuluhed the Whacked : He hides in my thoughts, mortal. He waits for me to break... for me to bend to his will.And this will be his undoing. I will call for him. I will tell him that I will do as he asks. When he appears, kill him and take the key!Know this: Zuluhed is an ancient orc with unknown powers. He has surely been empowered further by Illidan. You risk your life for me in doing as I ask. Are you certain you wish to make such a sacrifice?"
1878,"Breaking Down Netherock : To whomever cares about the timely construction of the X-52 Nether-Rocket --The king of the local mountain giants, Netherock, has been terrorizing the Crumbling Wastes.  He's been interfering with operations all along the south ledge of the island!Take your friends and deal with him!  Then, return to me here in Area 52.Rocket-Chief Fuselage"
1879,"Off To Area 52 : I'm out here studying the nether - the ethereal currents and all that.  This is an ideal spot away from the lights and hubbub of town.  Isn't this bridge great?  If I could just keep this junk working.Hey, you know, if you're looking for work there's plenty at Area 52!  It's just up the path and take a right at the fork in the road.Why don't you deliver my latest research notes to Rocket-Chief Fuselage?  I'm sure that he'd have plenty for you to do, what with the X-52 rocket ship, and all!"
1880,"Teleport This! : As fun as killing demons might be, it does us little good when the Legion can keep using its teleporters to replace anything we kill.Unfortunately, I don't have any high-powered explosives handy... but the mo'arg that maintain the teleporters do.Take this rod... I've tuned its powers to interfere with mo'arg brain frequencies.  Return to Forge Base: Gehenna and use it on any mo'arg you see.  You won't have long, but you'll be able to use their demolition charges on the nearby teleporters."
1881,"Conjurer Luminrath : The cloak, undoubtedly of high elven craftsmanship, is richly tailored, even by the standards of the Kirin Tor. The symbols and characters sewn into the cloak's fabric hold no meaning for you, but clearly imbue the garment with magical properties.Perhaps this object binds the spirit of its former owner to this plane of existence. If so, returning it to the dresser in Conjurer Luminrath's quarters might break the spirit's link to this world, allowing it to rest."
1882,"It's a Fel Reaver, But with Heart : You see that scrapped fel reaver over there to the south?  Isn't it a thing of beauty?I want its heart!What?  Yes, of course it has a heart... what doesn't?<N. D. looks indignant for a moment.>Go on over there, pry it open, bring back what I want and I'll give you a nice finder's fee in return.Oh, and I'd take a friend or two along if I were you.  These Zaxxis ethereals are a pretty mean bunch!Take this fel zapper to jumpstart its heart when you're ready to begin."
1883,
1884,"Abjurist Belmara : This worn, sturdy tome is no spellbook, as you might expect a Kirin Tor mage to carry. The pages of the volume are covered with hand-copied stories, accompanied by colorful illustrations.The tome seems to be far older than its former owner and may have even been a family heirloom. A powerful tie to the book may have been the last thread tying Belmara's spirit to the ruins of Kirin'Var. Returning it to its proper place on the bookshelf in her quarters might help appease her restless spirit."
1885,"Battle-Mage Dathric : The sword is of exceptional quality, finely crafted and perfectly balanced for a battle-mage. The seal of the Kirin Tor and the name ""Dathric"" are engraved into the weapon's pommel.Turning the weapon over in your hands, you notice a sense of wrongness radiating from the metal, as if the item is torn between two worlds. Could this be the item anchoring Battle-Mage Dathric's spirit to this world?Perhaps returning it to its proper place can break the bond, freeing Dathric's spirit to rest at last."
1886,Shattering the Veil : <Gordawg breaks off a piece of ebon rock from his back.>You are granted a piece of the fury of the earth. Take the boulder of Gordawg and hurl it at the poison rock. Shatter their shells to discover the truth. Destroy the minions of the usurper and return to Gordawg with the name.You find the shattered elements at the edge of the world. Southwest.
1887,"Disrupting the Twilight Portal : One of your responsibilities as a captain of Dragonmaw is to snuff out Burning Legion activity in Outland. It is your duty to silence those that defy Lord Illidan!The demons foolishly attempt to stabilize the portal found on the Twilight Ridge of western Nagrand. They must pay for their treachery, and you will be the orc that collects on their debt.Travel to the Twilight Ridge and lay waste to its inhabitants. You will be responsible for making at least one attack per day on their fortifications."
1888,"Cohlien Frostweaver : Looking at the hat, you find yourself asking if any Kirin Tor mage would own such headgear. Judging from the hat's wear, it seems the gnome wouldn't go anywhere without it.You try on the hat momentarily, discovering no magical properties beyond a faint urge to dance.The treasured possession might be the source of the dead mage's bond to the village. Placing the hat in the footlocker in Cohlien's quarters might free his spirit."
1889,"There Is No Hope : You are an honorable <race>, <name>. You have done much for the Mag'har. No one could ever deny your service to my people. Alas, the time of the Mag'har is at an end. You have shown me, more than anything, that I am unfit to lead these people. My cursed blood runs too deep. I will not... I cannot become the second Hellscream to damn the orcs.Please, <name>, return to the Greatmother and tell her what I have told you. I am too ashamed to see her... to look into her eyes."
1890,"The Sunfury Garrison : After Prince Kael'thas's forces destroyed the village and imprisoned the archmage in the Violet Tower, they withdrew to Sunfury Hold to the northeast. The very men who destroyed our village and slew our fellows toast their 'amazing victory' while we are helpless to avenge the fallen.We must not allow these crimes to go unanswered! Be the instrument of our vengeance, <name>. Go to Sunfury Hold and claim the lives of those responsible for this crime."
1891,"Seeker of Truth : You may be familiar with Orik Trueheart. He has devoted his time after the Northrend campaign to learning more about Tyr. Orik has evidence of a powerful shield crafted by Tyr long ago. With the help of the Sunwalkers, we may finally be able to seek it out.Please speak to him immediately."
1892,"Full Triangle : With the data from both the first and second points, I'm now certain that the crystal is at the top of the Ruins of Farahlon to the northeast.Unfortunately, the data indicates that the crystal is moving, which means that it has already been discovered, probably by the Burning Legion!Just in case, I recommend that you take some friends along.Slay the demon that has the crystal and return it to Nexus-Prince Haramad."
1893,"An Apexis Relic : Long ago a now-extinct sect of the arakkoa known as the Apexis lived here.  Remnants of their civilization are still present.  We call them apexis relics.What we know about them is that, when properly used, they grant a boon.  Each relic presents a colored sequence which, when the crystals are pressed in the correct order, leads through a series of levels, each harder than the last.An apexis shard is needed to power the relic.  Return when you have attained the insight of the apexis vibration."
1894,"Seek Out Neltharaku : Their patron soars high above, <name>. Perhaps the kindness that you showed his children has moved his heart. Seek Neltharaku out and enlist his aid. Together, you may be able to solve the plight of the Netherwing drakes.<Mordenai points to the sky.>Fly high, friend..."
1895,"Tablets of Baa'ri : The Ashtongue Broken have been ordered by Illidan to excavate the Ruins of Baa'ri, to the far north.  They're in search of draenei artifacts, no doubt - Baa'ri was home to many Baa'ri relics before Gul'dan buried the town under a volcanic explosion.  We must use this opportunity to recover the Tablets of Baa'ri, an ancient text rumored to hold the secrets of the Temple of Karabor... a place you might know as the Black Temple."
1896,"Proof of Allegiance : Akama has been tracking your progress quite closely, <name>.The Ashtongue you've slain at the Ruins of Baa'ri are amongst the most evil Broken known among us... carefully hand-picked by Akama himself to maintain the facade we need to present to Illidan.  The Deathsworn, however, know of Akama's true intentions.First things first.  We need to know that you are not with Illidan.  A Satyr known as Zandras watches over us from above the prison walls on his behalf.  Slay him as proof of your allegiance."
1897,The Booterang: A Cure For The Common Worthless Peon : This is your booterang. There are many like it but this one is yours.As an overseer you will use this booterang to sow terror into the hearts of defiant peons. Proper use of the booterang will instill obedience and ensure subservience.Venture forth to the crystal fields and discipline any peons that you see slacking off. Show them the might of the booterang!
1898,"Quenching the Blade : The blade is nearly finished!You can almost feel the magic beginning to coalesce inside the steel, but one thing remains to be done.You must take the forged blade to the Scalding Pools near the top of the Hand of Gul'dan in Shadowmoon Valley and plunge it into the lava pools to quench the sword. When you have quenched the sword, return."
1899,"The Secret Compromised : Thanks again, <name>.  I recognize your name.  Akama has entrusted you with his plans and so I will trust you as well.The naga discovered I was working against Illidan and tried to get me to speak by torturing me.  I did not tell them a thing - Akama himself taught me to master pain through meditation.Illidan asked the naga to bring me to him.  He would have seen right through my flesh and into my soul's deepest secrets.Akama must be warned.  Our plans are in jeopardy!"
1900,"Subdue the Subduer : <Balthas holds up an alien looking device.>This is a soul cannon. Its effects are devastating when attuned. This one is attuned to my blood. The same blood flowing through the veins of Reth'hedron - my brother. Aye, his misplaced allegiance will be the end of him.Take the cannon and fly to the Twilight Ridge in western Nagrand. Locate Reth'hedron and fire! You must stay on your mount and within range for the effects to take hold. Stand your ground against him and he will have no choice but to flee!"
1901,"The Ata'mal Terrace : It has been known to us that the fel orcs, under Illidan's command, have guarded an Ata'mal crystal known as the Heart of Fury at the Ata'mal Terrace.  They cloud its presence with dark magic, to keep it from the Sha'tar.Fight your way to the Atam'al Terrace outside the Black Temple and turn your eyes to the sky.  Shadowlord Deathwail will circle the terrace, beyond your reach.  You will have to slay him and his warlocks before you can obtain the crystal.It won't be easy, <name>.  I wish you luck."
1902,
1903,"To Netherwing Ledge! : I believe that I can imbue nethervine crystals with my own essence. The power contained within these imbued crystals should be sufficient to free enslaved drakes of their masters' grasps.Travel to Netherwing Ledge, an island located off the broken shelf of Shadowmoon Valley, to the southeast. It is on Netherwing Ledge that you will find nethervine crystals. Return to me when you have collected enough crystals to fill your packs.And <name>, Beware the Dragonmaw that now inhabit the island."
1904,"Warp-Raider Nesaad : Warp-Raider Nesaad must be dealt with!  I have no idea how he survived my attack, but he cannot be allowed to continue his operation out there.Go back and take out Nesaad.  He keeps a small ethereal camp near the southwestern corner of the Heap.Don't fail like I did, <class>."
1905,"Picking Up The Pieces... : Much of our hard work lies scattered about in these mines. Carts full of cargo are littered across every inch of this mine! We just can't get to any of it with the current infestation.That's where you come in, <name>. Your daily duty here at this mine is to collect the cargo left behind by the miners and deep mine workers.Gather the nethermine cargo and return it to me or my sister."
1906,"Gurok the Usurper : Gurok must be summoned. You summon Gurok and you destroy.You must go to Warmaul Hill to the northwest and find where ogre worships Gurok. You put ogre skull from Warmaul ogres on Gurok's earthen brand. Only then will Gurok come. Seven skulls.If you live, bring Gordawg back Gurok earthen head. Gordawg crushes head.<Gordawg bites down hard, shaking the earth beneath your feet.>"
1907,"Divination: Gorefiend's Truncheon : One by one they knelt before him, offering their lives as a show of allegiance. Gorefiend hoisted his sickle and cut clean their heads. Shortly after this slaughter, Gorefiend took his own life.But this was no act of contrition! No, Gorefiend sought immortality! From the corpses of the fallen death knights rose the Ghostriders of Karabor.They now ride the roads encircling the Hand of Guldan, awaiting the day that their master returns. It is they who hold the truncheon of Gorefiend. Retrieve it..."
1908,"Akama's Promise : <Akama inserts the crystal into the medallion in his hand.>I am not as strong as I once was, <name>.  Being so close to evil itself all these years - I do not know if I can trust myself with an artifact as powerful as this.Take this as my promise to you that when the time comes and you face Illidan, I will be on your side.  Take it to the one being we know we can trust with its power.  Take the medallion to A'dal in Shattrath City."
1909,"What the Soul Sees : For several centuries, the spirits of Auchindoun coalesced into my darkened essence. Many of the catastrophes that befell this crypt were a direct result of my weakened state.Regrettably, there is nothing that can be done to stop this cycle. It is a facet of the naaru condition - without the void, the Light cannot exist.Your only recourse is to destroy the ancient spirits of Nagrand before they transform into creatures of the void. Use the soul mirrors found throughout this crypt to free them..."
1910,"Enter the Taskmaster : <Mor'ghor crumples up the service letter and tosses it aside.>Alright grunt, first things first. If you're gonna join my beloved Dragonmaw army, you'll need to work. Everyone works up here on the ledge. Get a job and don't screw it up and I'll see if there might be something more interesting for you to do later.Go talk to Taskmaster Varkule Dragonbreath. He's standin' in the middle of town. He'll assess your skills and assign work as he sees fit.Now get out of my face!"
1911,"A Visit With the Greatmother : The Greatmother has asked that I seek you out and deliver a message. She wishes to speak with you at once.My will has been sapped but make no mistake, <name>, if you anger the Greatmother, I will come down upon you with all the force that I can muster. She is in the main hall.<Garrosh points at the large building to the north.>Listen to what she has to say and do as she tells you."
1912,"The Relic's Emanation : Now that you have felt the enlightening vibrations of the apexis relics, it is time for you to further your understanding of their workings.  We are very eager to benefit from your observations!As you progress in your ability to attune to the relics, you will gain a higher level of knowledge.  This recognition will come in the form of an emanation from the relic.Return to us when you have attained such an emanation."
1913,"Forge Camp: Annihilated : Gather your allies, <name>. You will need them if you are to face an overseer.Once you have a suitable group, find and kill the overseers at each camp. Take their keys and use them to turn and fire the fel cannons upon the camps. Return to me once the camps are destroyed."
1914,"Lord Illidan Stormrage : Come, highlord <name>. Illidan himself awaits us!"
1915,"The Cipher of Damnation - Ar'tor's Charge : At last, we are ready. I will bestow a piece of my spirit upon you, hero. It will guard you and help you in your battle against evil.You must then travel south of here towards the back of Illidari Point. Hidden in the ether is a vile creature known as Veneratus the Many. My spirit hunter will call him out when he is near.Destroy Veneratus and take from his corpse the second part of the Cipher of Damnation."
1916,"The Smallest Creatures : The ogres, simple as they are, would notice you dispersing this poison throughout their camp. Thus, I will teach you how to enlist the help of one of nature's smallest creatures to do this task.By playing a simple rhythm on this drum, you can coax a marmot to follow your commands.There is a den of marmots near the Bloodmaul camp, to the north, down in the Daggermaw Canyon past the Circle of Blood.Once you have a marmot's aid, use it to disperse the poison to the Bloodmaul's kegs."
1917,"You, Robot : Doctor Vomisa, Ph.T. at your service.  Here, take this controller.  I want you to activate it and give my newly-invented Scrap Reaver X6000 a spin.Just stay nearby!  The controller is tied to my console here, and if you get too far away, the robot will cease to function.Try out everything... I'll be watching and calibrating its servos based upon your test run."
1918,"Turning Point : This is the chance we've been waiting for, <name>.  Not only have we uncovered the evidence we need to show our people who Kael'thas is really working for, but we can prove our strength by defeating his new masters.My frail health prevents me from aiding you in person with this endeavor, but I will offer you an object that will allow me to project my powers across the continent."
1919,"News of Victory : You must bring word of our success to Overlord Or'barokh immediately! Now that we've crushed the Legion and obliterated their presence in Shadowmoon Valley, the overlord can turn his attention to our other foes.Although the Kor'kron guard will never admit it, they'll be glad we're no longer fighting on two fronts."
1920,"Deathblow to the Legion : When facing eredar of great power, large armies are useless for the most part.  Their corruptive powers over mortal souls are such that only the strongest-willed can even stand face to face with them.Take this stone to the Invasion Point: Overlord, between Forge Base: Oblivion and Gehenna and bring your closest, strongest friends with you.  Orelis and Karja will meet you at Socrethar's Seat; I will send Adyen along with them.May the Light prevail today, <name>.  May Socrethar meet his end."
1921,"Showdown : Now it comes to this. We will bring Goc forth from his lair, and we will destroy him. With Goc dead, the Bladespire ogres will threaten the Mok'Nathal no longer. Go to Goc's altar outside Gruul's Lair, then blow my horn. I will come, and we will face the son of Gruul together."
1922,"Divination: Gorefiend's Cloak : Many a cruel act he committed but none so cold as the slaughter of the clerics of Karabor.After Gul'dan's Horde defeated the draenei of Karabor, the surviving clerics of Karabor were marched out, told that they were to be taken to Hellfire Citadel as prisoners of war.Gorefiend, not yet a death knight, murdered each and every last one of them in cold blood. They now roam in front of the Black Temple with vengeance in their hearts.It is the clerics of Karabor that hold the cloak of Gorefiend."
1923,"Varedis Must Be Stopped : Of course we must destroy this book, but not before we use it to destroy Varedis.If we're to shut down this academy of Illidan imitators, we'll have to deal not just with Varedis but also the three night elf masters that assist him: Alandien, Theras and Netharel.Gather a suitable force and return to the Ruins of Karabor.  Follow Altruis's instructions for defeating Varedis.  Hopefully his plan will work - otherwise... it'll have been a pleasure working with you."

1925,"The Fallen Exarch : They are feeding the souls they steal to a coffin that they have dragged out from the Auchenai Crypts. My scouts believe the contents of the coffin to contain the first exarch of the crypts. They seek to resurrect the ancient one!You must battle your way to the western side of Auchindoun and disturb the contents of that coffin before they feed it enough souls. Should you lose your way, follow the walking souls.Destroy whatever is inside that coffin!"
1926,"The Hand of Gul'dan : The elements need your help, <race>! Shadowmoon Valley has been subject to unspeakable evils. The spirits remain tortured to this day. Many are enraged and unwilling to commune with the Earthen Ring.Help this world heal, friend.Southeast of Shadowmoon Village - in the heart of Shadowmoon Valley - you will find an area known as the Altar of Damnation. Make your way there and speak with Earthmender Torlok."
1927,"City of Light : Do not burden A'dal with petty inquisitions, <class>.  That just might be the most powerful being you ever come face to face with.You do not look familiar.  I suppose you want to learn about the city?You'll have to excuse me if I don't give you a tour myself, but I'm a bit busy discussing strategy with A'dal.  Perhaps you'll find a summoned servant acceptable in my stead?  Excellent!"
1928,"Ravager Egg Roundup : I'm starving!There's irony in that, wouldn't you say?  A starving cook?<Legassi laughs half-heartedly and taps a folded piece of parchment he has in his pocket.>According to this tourist map we were following - before we were so rudely shot down - there's an area to the southwest, near Terokkar Forest.  It's called the Razorthorn Trail, and supposedly it's brimming with delicious ravager eggs!I could cook up quite a feast if only someone were brave enough to go down there and get me some!"
1929,"Borak, Son of Oronok : While Ar'tor was off hunting and Grom'tor was off fighting, Borak studied. Eventually he took up a vocation as a scholar and left for the wilds of Draenor. He returned home a few years ago a changed orc.His heightened sense of awareness and mental acuity had forged a silent assassin.Now a confident and powerful orc, he has taken to recovering the most guarded piece of the cipher.Find Borak hiding near Eclipse Point, far to the south. He watches from the shadows of the bridge."
1930,"The Cipher of Damnation - Borak's Charge : That Cipher fragment will never reach Zuluhed. You're going to ambush Ruul the Darkener and his transport before it has a chance to make the delivery.The Dragonmaw Fortress is directly east of here, across the Netherwing Fields. Somewhere between Dragonmaw Fortress and the Sanctum of the Stars is where you'll find Ruul. Strike hard and strike fast! And <name>, from the sound of it, this Ruul is going to be tough. Keep your guard up.Return the Cipher to me should you succeed."
1931,"Terokk's Downfall : I... I've turned a blind eye to your dealings with the arakkoa prisoner, <name>.  It looks like your instincts to cooperate with him were right.You must understand... I would've faced a mutiny in my current state if I endorsed your efforts to bring Terokk to this world.Take the items that Hazzik prepared for you and go ahead with your plan.  I will command my men to back you up when the time comes.  I recommend that you bring a force of your own as well.  I fear you'll only get one chance at this."
1932,Dragons are the Least of Our Problems : That dragon waking up riled up a host of other nasty creatures in these mines. Two types are proving to be a thorn in the side of the Dragonmaw: Nethermine flayers and Nethermine ravagers. You must help us by killing them off. All I ask is your involvement once per day.Get in there and kill as many as you can!
1933,"The Great Murkblood Revolt : This document outlines a revolt planned by the Murkblood broken. It seems that the dragon was to be used as a diversion to draw attention away from their escape. Looking at all of the corpses littering the mine, it would be safe to assume that their plans failed.Return the escape plans to the Mistress of the Mines."
1934,"Additional Materials : The ingots that you brought contain most of the metal I'll need to forge the sword's blade, but I'll need a variety of things to create other parts of the weapon.Let's see, among the things I don't have here are an adamantite frame, some heavy knothide leather, and a demon warding totem. Skilled crafters should be able to produce the first two, but the third is only sold by the reagent vendor in Shattrath's Lower City, Fantei. You'll find him with the other tradesmen."
1935,"Entry Into the Black Temple : <A'dal shows you an image of a naaru outside of the Black Temple, fighting alongside draenei vindicators and blood elf magisters.  You immediately understand that this is the distraction Akama is waiting for.>"
1936,"Finding the Keymaster : In retrospect, I suppose I should've expected Kael'thas's magic to be this robust. He's always been a talented mage, but I've never seen anything like the power he wielded during the attack on the tower.The ward keeps me from being able to scry out the force holding it in place, but it doesn't preclude you from scrying.You'll require a focus, though. A crystal-bearing giant named Apex roams the plains to the west of Manaforge Duro. One of its crystals would make an excellent scrying focus."
1937,"The Mark of the Nexus-King : What I must now know is what the Ethereum have held inside the Mana-Tombs of Auchindoun.In your battles against the beasts of the stasis chambers of Bash'ir you may run across an item known as the Mark of the Nexus-King. Should you find such an item, return it to me immediately! It is the final piece in crafting a key that will allow access to the stasis chamber inside the Mana-Tombs."
1938,"Don't Kill the Fat One : I have been watching these beasts for days. The fat one says that he is waiting for something. What he is waiting for, however, is a mystery.I have a plan but it is going to involve some violence on your part. You will need to kill several of his subordinates and then beat him within an inch of his life. Do this and I am certain he will tell us everything that we need to know."
1939,"The Deadliest Trap Ever Laid : Take these Aldor medals. Mor'ghor will need proof of ""victory"" once this is over. He will recognize them as coming from the corpses of fallen Aldor soldiers.Now all that remains is to use the signal flare to alert the Dragonmaw raiders. We will crush them when you are ready. Just give me the word."
1940,The Howling Wind : This amorphous mass of elemental air is speaking to you in a language that you cannot understand. You believe the language to be the tongue of the elements: Kalimag. Perhaps someone at the Throne of the Elements could shed some insight on this unusual find.
1941,"The Ring of Blood: Brokentoe : So are you ready for your first battle? If you are, let me know and I'll get things started. All you have to do is go wait in the Ring of Blood for your opponent to arrive.This fight is against Brokentoe, a ferocious clefthoof.Good luck! I hope you brought friends.And remember, the fight's over when either you or your opponent are lying face down on the arena floor."
1942,"A Damp, Dark Place : Soon after I escaped the Umbrafen tribe, I holed up in a cave south of their village.  Little did I know that the cave was being fought over by marsh beasts and spore men!I had to leave in a hurry and left behind a box containing my only worldly possessions.After managing to sneak out of Umbrafen with my belongings it was terrible irony that I would lose them so soon after.  If you're willing to bring them back to me I'll give you one of my very own personal items.  What do you say, <name>?"
1943,"Hellfire Fortifications : The Hellfire Citadel wages constant battles with our forces.  We are holding our own so far, but we can't yet launch a real offensive against them.  To do that, we need forward staging areas.Our scouts identified three fortifications near Hellfire Citadel.  We want you to help secure these forts.  Capture each fort, and then report back to me.May fortune shine upon you in the conflicts ahead, <name>, for you will no doubt clash with Horde forces eager to gain these same fortifications."
1944,"Teron Gorefiend, I am... : With Gorefiend's items restored, there is but one last piece to this puzzle: A host.<The ancient shadowmoon spirit's lips curl up  to form a wicked grin.>Surely you did not believe the fairy tale that I told you. The Altar of Shadows is my prison. Without your help, I would have been stuck here for all eternity. Now, I will take over your body and you will destroy my captors and break these bonds. Refuse and we will both be stuck here forever.Teron Gorefiend will be free!"
1945,"Bomb Them Again! : We're still having problems with those flak cannons, <name>.Don't get me wrong -- I think that you did an outstanding job the last time out -- but, that doesn't change the fact that those damned demons seem to be replenishing their ammo supplies faster than we can knock them out.  And that means we're having a hell of a time getting our people through there, not to mention the risk those demons pose to Ogri'la.What do you say?  Want to take another shot at it?"
1946,"Our Boy Wants To Be A Skyguard Ranger : <class>, we've got a problem -- we have lots of sons.  And ever since the Skyguard moved in nearby, all our sons ever talk about is joining their ranks.As a proud father, we want them to have every advantage for when they apply.  So, would you go to the fel crystalforge at either forge camp to the north or south, and procure a magic flask for our sons?  You can't miss their green smoke.We think that they take ten apexis shards to make.  We'd give you the shards, but we don't have any at the moment."
1947,"A Time for Negotiation... : When we arrived in the Ruuan Weald, the wyrm cultists were keeping themselves to Blackwing Coven, through the tunnel to the west.  But now, they are encroaching upon us here.I need you to find the wyrmcultists' overseer.  He's known to make a regular patrol between their various camps in the Ruuan Weald.Negotiate with him.  Let him know that there's room for compromise, but that we will not condone or allow the wholesale slaughter of the wildlife, nor the felling of all of the trees."
1948,"The Ring of Blood: The Final Challenge : <Gurgthock is counting his massive pile of gold.>You've made me a lot of money, kid. If you can defeat Mogor, I promise to make it worth your while. All that pain you suffered in the Ring of Blood is gonna end up paying off.Now get in there and show these ogres what you're made of!"
1949,"In Defense of Halaa : We are not a warlike race, <race>.  However when war comes to our lands, we do not run away from it.The Alliance and the Horde wage war in the city of Halaa, to the northwest. We do not know what the blood elves are scheming, but any victory for the Horde would be disastrous.  The history between our people and the orcs is one of bloodshed and betrayal.Go and slay the enemy in Halaa and you will be rewarded in coin, honor and renown."
1950,"Ethereum Secrets : <Ameer holds up a tag.>I found this prisoner I.D. tag with the remains of the fallen vanguard. I can only assume that all of their prisoners are tagged in the same manner.I'm going to start cataloguing the tags in hopes of making sense of their penal system. If in your adventures you find more Ethereum prison keys, you can use them to open the Ethereum prisons at the Ethereum Staging Grounds - directly south of here. Bring me back any and all I.D. tags that you find."
1951,"Vengeful Souls : The Tomb of Lights has become corrupted by the Shadow Council and the draenei dead have become cursed spirits, angry and confused with a burning hatred for the living.Enter the tomb and seek out these tragic victims. Give them the rest that they deserve."
1952,"Elemental Power Extraction : Darn it, that didn't do it!Ok, I've got another idea!  I had Xyrol whip up an elemental power extractor.  I'm not certain exactly what this power will do, but I know that I can use it.The sundered rumblers and warp aberrations on the ledge of the Crumbling Wastes to the south have just what I need for the engines!The extractor will change the form of their power into something solid that you'll be able to gather up after you've defeated them."
1953,"A'dal : Welcome to Shattrath City, <class>.  This might be the one place in all of Outland where you'll find any semblance of safety.A group of naaru known as the Sha'tar drove the demons away from here.If you've never met a naaru, you ought to see A'dal inside the Terrace of Light.  The leader of the Sha'tar is an awe-inspiring sight if I ever saw one.  Sure is a change of pace from anything else in this bleak land."
1954,"Spirits of Auchindoun : The draenei might be our enemies, but the spirits of their ancestors in Auchindoun are restless and have no allegiance.The draenei's custom required them to pay their respects at spirit towers at various times during the day.  If you can help secure a tower during these times, you will help the spirits return to peace in Auchindoun.The Alliance will try to capture the towers in order to secure the dead's favor.   We must ensure that our side succeeds instead."
1955,"Saving the Sporeloks : Ikeyen's been telling me stories about what happened to him down in those caves and I think it's just awful!You know, maybe we should do something to help out those poor sporeloks.  Ikeyen says that they live there in the Funggor Cavern, but that the marsh beasts have recently invaded.Why don't you go down there and see if you can clear some of those marsh beasts out?  It's just to the southwest."
1956,"Drain Schematics : The schematics you've obtained show an underground system of drains and pumps that connect the lakes in the region to Serpent Lake.If the schematics are correct, there is a giant drain in the center of Serpent Lake.  Confirm this and bring the news to Cenarion Refuge."
1957,
1958,"Now That We're Friends... : The naga of the Bloodscale Enclave to the northeast have begun to kill our people.  We cannot allow this to continue, <class>!We suggest that you teach them a lesson as proof of our friendship."
1959,"Of Thistleheads and Eggs... : I'd have given up had I not noticed... He's a Thistlehead. I couldn't place it at first but the signs are all there...Now if we could get our hands on some bloodthistle, we'd be in business.In my travels, I met a shady Broken in Shattrath named Tobias.Tobias made a business of trading bloodthistle to blood elves for rotten arakkoa eggs.Directly west of here are arakkoa ruins. Search them for an egg and head to the lower city of Shattrath. That's where you'll find Tobias."
1960,"The Netherwing Mines : Your help is required at the Netherwing Mines, overseer <name>.Two days ago our mining operations came to a grinding halt when we made a grim discovery. A miner was working in the depths of the mine and struck his pick upon an unusual crystal formation. Unfortunately, this crystal formation was attached to a very angry nether dragon. The beast woke from its slumber and annihilated all of our workers.Report to the Mistress of the Mines. They await you at the mouth of the mines, southwest of here."
1961,"Special Delivery to Shattrath City : I am an ethereal of my word, <name>.  You have truly inspired me.I am now going to give you the ata'mal crystal to hand over to the naaru.  As it was your heroics that made this possible, I wish for you to deliver it.You may use my personal teleporter to go directly to Shattrath City.  Simply step through it and you will be transported there.Give the crystal to the naaru known as A'dal on the Terrace of Light.  May the trade winds be at your back."
1962,"Planting the Banner : I want you to steal the Bladespire banner from one of their champions and take it south to Bloodmaul Outpost.  Plant it atop their Northmaul Tower.This will infuriate the Bloodmaul and they will attack you relentlessly.  But it will also keep their hatred focused on Bladespire Hold, and away from Sylvanaar.You will know you have accomplished the deed when you have defeated Gurn Grubnosh and taken his helm.  Return it to Sylvanaar.<name>, this isn't going to be easy.  Take a  friend or two with you."
1963,"Dimensius the All-Devouring : Your brave actions have forced Ameer to react! He has deployed Captain Saeed and the Avengers!Now all that is left to do is destroy Dimensius.When you are ready, I will call for Saeed. If he is not currently fighting another battle, he will be awaiting orders from you - directly east of here.Let him know when you are ready to fight and he will put his troops in motion!I wish you luck, fleshling! We have hunted Dimensius for a thousand years!"
1964,"Dragonmaw Race: The Ballad of Oldie McOld : Don't let the gray hair fool you, grunt. I'm still ten times the rider that you are! And don't go thinking that this old dog doesn't have any tricks up his sleeve.Now all you gotta do is follow me and try not to get knocked down off your mount. If you can do that, Oldie will admit defeat.We'll lift off as soon as you're ready."
1965,"Smooth as Butter : Screed likes to say his flying is as ""smooth as butter."" I think ""butterfingered"" is more like it!Take a look at the wreckage over there. He calls it a ""rough"" landing.Sure, we got shot at, but I'd be willing to cut him a little more slack if he didn't brag about his piloting skills so often!I think I'm going to make him a batch of wings to drive the point home. To the east, in the Valley of Bones, you'll find bonestripper buzzards. Their wings are plump, juicy, and perfect for my needs."
1966,"Arelion's Mistress : With all the important matters at hand Arelion still found time in his schedule to see a mistress!It's all becoming perfectly clear.  Viera Sunwhisper, that filthy wench... we'll show her to never cross a magistrix again.Take this scroll and find Viera.  Find a way to lure her away from town and use the scroll on her.Arelion mentioned she couldn't resist a particular wine harvested by the cenarion druids.  You might find some at Cenarion Refuge, just inside Zangarmarsh, west of here."
1967,"The Crystals : When prepared correctly, the crystals of the mountains exhibit strange powers, such as the clarity of mind that we have found here in Ogri'la.All of the creatures atop the mountains covet the crystal shards and use them to further their own goals.  An economy has even sprung up around them.To assist us, you must first learn about the Apexis shards.  Bring me some.  In addition to the creatures here having them, they can sometimes be found where the flayers dig at the larger crystals."
1968,"Guardian of the Monument : You've figured out how to use the single-person relics, but as you may have seen, there are bigger ones, which they surround.These larger apexis monuments function in much the same way, but they take many more apexis shards to activate and require four persons to operate.Of greater concern to us are the guardians that are summoned through their use.  These crystal constructs turned on their arakkoan masters long ago, and now endanger Ogri'la.We would ask that you destroy one and bring us proof."
1969,"Fire At Will! : Now that the ammunition can affect the Burning Legion, it's time for you to use it.There are two warp-gates, which are used for teleportation and enhancement of the void terrors.  One is in the south and the other in the north, and each is within range of a fel cannon.Use the naturalized ammunition to take control of each fel cannon and destroy the warp-gates.Attack the gate with artillery to begin, and be prepared to kill its defenders to keep the cannon alive if necessary."
1970,Murkblood Invaders : The parchment holds a crudely painted map of Nagrand. There is a big red 'X' where Telaar would be on the map. It would seem that these savages are planning an attack on the city. Take the Murkblood invasion plans to Arechron in Telaar.
1971,"Enemies, Old and New : Our ancient enemy, the draenei, have returned with powerful allies.  They wage war in Halaa, southwest of here.We cannot allow them a victory there as Garadar would be next without a doubt.Go and slay those who would aid our ancient enemy."

When all three fragments are pieced together, the ancient words will be known once more.Good luck, <name>. Tell my father that I will be home soon."
1973,"Gauging the Resonant Frequency : Take these scanners to the Singing Ridge.  By dropping them in a pattern on the ground, you will create overlapping fields that will read the amplitude of the crystals.  Stand amidst them in such a way that you're in five oscillation fields and I'll have the information that I need!Your scanners will even work with those that others drop.Oh, and it's likely that a rift will be formed!  I have no idea what, if anything, will come out of it, but be prepared for the worst."
1974,"The Dread Relic : Long ago a caravan went to Auchindoun with a mission to take a Dread Relic from the ancient tombs beneath the necropolis. They fled, but the relic was their undoing.  The relic is evil and it summons evil when touched.   Their caravan was destroyed somewhere to the east.

Unfortunately, that is exactly what we are dealing with here.The leader of these barbarians is an ogre named Cho'war. Rumor has it that Cho'war was the ogre responsible for forcing the gronn out of the cave. Cho'war then declared himself king and dissolved the ogre clans that served under the gronn. Thus, Warmaul was born.Find Cho'war deep in the caves of Warmaul Hill. Slay him and bring me his head."
1977,"Zeth'Gor Must Burn! : It's time to strike Zeth'Gor from the air!  Our gryphon riders are ready for a sortie, <name>.  But they need someone on the ground to direct their fire.  Are you ready for a covert mission?Take these smoke beacons into Zeth'Gor, the Bleeding Hollow stronghold to the west.  They have four guard towers: one near their northern wall, one near their southern wall, one near their forge and another nestled in their foothills.

Were they the ones killing our people that traveled north?!<name>, you must put a stop to this, and the only way to do that is to finish off their leader, Nexus-Prince Razaan.You'll have to coax him out of hiding though.  I'm guessing that you can do that by killing a lot of his Razaani ethereal.Bring me the collection of souls that he no doubt has."
1979,
1980,"Cruel's Intentions : Magister Bloodhawk finally deciphered the Legion missive you found earlier. It turned out to be attack plans sent by one of Highlord Kazzak's lieutenants - Arazzius the Cruel. Apparently, Arazzius commands the Legion ground forces in Hellfire. The time has come to terminate his command, <name>. Terminate with extreme prejudice. Head west to the Pools of Aggonar and put an end to this so-called 'Legion lord'. Today, the Horde reclaims Hellfire Peninsula. Let the Legion be damned."
1981,"Illidari-Bane Shard : The shard appears to be a piece of a larger weapon. Sharp-looking runes etched into the metal glow with a menacing light.The weapon's intended purpose isn't clear to you, but it's hard to ignore. Most of the mo'arg at Legion Hold seem to be working with fragments of the same metal you hold in your hand. Perhaps one of the weaponsmiths at Shadowmoon Village might be able to tell you more about it."
1982,"Dragonmaw Race: Wing Commander Mulverick : Three years of blood, sweat and tears. Mostly tears... The amount of crying that a hardened soldier does when it comes down to all-out war is amazing!""They're jumping into our tower with their horses!"" ""Why is their base so well defended?"" ""They're taking our relief hut, I'm going A.W.O.L.!""Wimps...I took the first train out of ""cry-town"" the minute the Dark Portal opened. Now I'm a top gun for the Dragonmaw.

You have single-handedly saved my clan from extermination.You may tell your leader that Lantresor of the Burning Blade and his Boulderfist ogres accept the offering of peace.<Lantresor bows.>
1984,"Building a Perimeter : We are prepared to try to construct a perimeter around the village using the energy source taken from the blood elves. I can't guarantee that it will work, but we have to attempt it.Otherwise, the mana creatures will surely continue devouring the spirits of the fallen Kirin Tor.Use this device at the small runes around the perimeter of town to release the energy there. If I've woven the field correctly, we should start noticing a difference once you've used the device at each point."
1985,"The Journal of Val'zareq: Portends of War : This journal documents the recent activities of Illidan's armies. It also explains why Val'zareq was parading around the Path of Conquest. He was personally responsible for the capture of a high general of the Sha'tar.This general is being held at a post known as Crimson Watch, located at the southern end of the Path of Conquest. A mysterious faction, calling itself the Crimson Sigil, is charged with his incarceration. If you choose to investigate, it would be wise to bring allies."
1986,"Meeting at the Blackwing Coven : I know what must be done!  <name>, you must pose as Overseer Nuaar and attend that meeting!The wyrmcultists at the coven all have a standard outfit that they wear, so go collect scraps from them, and when you have enough, put together a disguise.Pose as Overseer Nuuar and speak with Kolphis Darkscale to see what he has to say, and then return to Tree Warden Chawn.You'll find the coven by heading through the Wyrmskull Tunnel and following the path past the Raven's Wood and Grishnath to its end."
1987,"The Hostage Soul : You might wonder why I go to such lengths to hide my intentions.  Why not throw my lot in openly with the naaru?My very essence - my soul - is held prisoner inside the Black Temple.  Illidan could destroy me any moment... until now!  This phylactery will allow me to regain control of my soul.The time has come, <name>.  I'll lead Maiev and my Deathsworn to Illidan's doorstep.Speak to A'dal and and tell him of our plan.  If we strike together we'll break through Illidan's defenses."
1988,"Bring Me The Egg! : Now that you've been initiated, I want you to get me that egg! Use the Jump-a-tron and try to hit the nest dead center. But be careful! Bodily injury or serious permanent damage may occur from a bad jump."

It is rumored that the colony of Skettis has constructed a maligned altar of worship. This Darkstone of Terokk must be purified if the arakkoa of Skith are ever to be redeemed.Take this Rod of Purification and cast it upon the Darkstone. Blessed by A'dal, the rod's purity might be enough to bring clarity to the Darkstone. Go now and may the light shine upon thee."

Try telling the demon that camp anger has revolted.Good luck to you <class>."
1993,"Summoner Kanthin's Prize : The next thing we must do is reclaim my familiar, Glacius, from the blood elf summoner who holds it captive. Summoner Kanthin was one of the most senior magisters in the force Kael'thas sent to decimate Kirin'Var. It's only natural that he would claim my familiar as a kind of trophy.I'm certain that Kanthin, fool that he is, has tried to compel Glacius to serve him. My scrying has revealed that Kanthin is now stationed at 'Manaforge Duro,' if that terminology has any meaning for you."
1994,"Patience and Understanding : Take the blueprints and travel to Shattrath City in the Terokkar forest. Once at Shattrath, go to the Lower City and look for a mo'arg by the name Sal'salabim.

If that does not work, use your fists."

1998,"Torgos! : There's a creature in the Bone Wastes so fearsome that only the dauntless dare to stalk him.I speak of Torgos, king of the bonelashers, who circles over Veil Rhaze on the western edge of the wastes.Too bad that there's an arakkoan scarecrow there, known as Torgos's Bane, which keeps him at bay.  I'd bet if you laid his mate Trachela's carcass at the foot of that scarecrow he'd come down anyway.  She can be found at Carrion Hill in the northern wastes.Bring me one of Torgos's tail feathers."
1999,"Assisting the Consortium : The naaru of Shattrath City have been trying to find a means to bring the Consortium over to their way of seeing things.Luck would have it that the business relationship between the ethereals and the blood elves of the Netherstorm has recently soured.There's a Consortium representative in town named Nether-Stalker Khay'ji who recently ran into trouble with a pack of renegade ethereals.

Which is to say, not at all.If you are to recover the Cipher of Damnation, you will need to listen to what I have to tell you. When you are ready, let me know and I will tell you the story."
2002,"Forward Base: Reaver's Fall : Your battle prowess has been noted by high command, <class>. They want to send you to the front lines to meet up with Maimfist's crew. They're radicals, devoted to the complete extermination of the Burning Legion, so you may fit right in...Head east about 200 paces and veer south at the jutting mass of land.

It's time to put an end to the threat from the Blackwing Coven by taking out their leader, Maxnar the Ashmaw.I don't know if you caught a glimpse of him while you were in there, but he's one of the dragonkin, half-man, half-dragon.  And he's tough, so don't underestimate him!Finish it quickly and with any luck you'll secure the safety of Evergrove and the Ruuan Weald."
2007,Beneath Thrallmar : I'm almost back in business.  Problem is all these gan'arg are in my mine.  I can't send my peons in and even once I fix this shredder I wouldn't want to risk it in combat. Deep down in the mine the gan'arg have a leader.  If you kill him maybe the gan'arg will leave.  Then I could make some money and buy my way out of here.
2008,"A Not-So-Modest Proposal : From the look on your face, I can tell you're a <race> who appreciates a good profit.I've built a reputation as a dealer in exotic goods, and I'm about to launch a new venture.I need a reliable subcontractor to procure the goods from the Celestial Ridge.First, you'll need to re-energize a teleport pad. There is a spare power pack in Access Shaft Zeon, which is on the south side of Manaforge UItris. The Protectorate is operating in there, so you may be able to follow their tracers to your goal."
2009,"I Was A Lot Of Things... : I've been a lot of things, stranger, but what I once was isn't what's important. What I am now is what matters and what I am now is a farmer.I use trained felboars to dig up tubers from the hardened earth of the Shattered Plains. Recently, though, flayers from a nest to the northeast have been attacking my animals, preventing me from gathering tubers.Would you go to the area north of here and gather tubers for me? Use this whistle while standing on a tuber mound and a boar will come dig one up!"
2010,"WANTED: Durn the Hungerer : You have destroyed two of the biggest threats in Nagrand, <name>. Are you ready to take on the scourge of the Spirit Fields?Durn the Hungerer lords over the area surrounding Oshu'gun, decimating all in his path. Thus far, none have been able to rid Nagrand of this ferocious gronn. Gather your allies and venture to the Spirit Fields, west of here, and track down Durn. Slay him and I assure you rewards commensurate with the difficulty of the task at hand."
2011,"Natural Remedies : It must be that the evil emanations from that giant crystal are summoning the mountain giants and driving them insane.It's too big to move, and beyond our ability to destroy, but I know a way to quell its power.I've summoned a circle at the northwest corner of the crystal on the ridge.  Take this seed to the circle and channel its powers to heal the land through the natural forces of rain, growth and insect repopulation.Beware, <name>, I sense an external force at play here... this is not natural!"
2012,"Picking Up Some Power Converters : Those dumb ogres at the Bladespire Outpost to the north have been raiding our power converters!  And you're going to get them back for me, sort of.No doubt, with their big, clumsy hands, the ogres have damaged the converters.  So, what I want you to do is release the energy from them and then use this protovoltaic magneto collector on the resultant electromental to encase it.It'll likely be sore with you, so you'll need to 'kill' it while it's contained in the magneto sphere."
2013,
2014,"I'm Saved! : I don't mind sharing.  I'm just glad to be saved from that creep, Gankly!  And I collected tons of skins from Zangarmarsh, so it's no problem at all!"
2015,"Securing the Celestial Ridge : The nether dragons have the same ferocious temperament as their black dragon forbears, but there is something entirely alien about them. They hatch and mature rapidly, harnessing the strange energies that forged their kind in the destruction of Draenor.There is so much more I need to know about them, but I believe the powers may be of use to my own flight. If we can displace the leader of these drakes, Veraku, with a show of dominance, we can cow the rest of them into submission."
2016,"A Thousand Worlds : I have cracked the code! Each tag is broken up into several segments. The front side of the tag is always the same and states: ""A Thousand Worlds..."" I am unsure as to the meaning of this phrase but it sounds insidious.On the back side of the tag are the vital statistics. The first set of runes indicates location and the second indicates prisoner type. Furthermore, it would seem that the keys can be combined to form a special key that accesses another prison type. Now I just need more keys..."
2017,"A Mysterious Portent : Before he died, Udalo appears to have written a single word on the floor beneath him.  The writing is barely legible but you recognize the word Atam'al.Perhaps Akama will understand the meaning of his brethren's message."
2018,"The Totem of Kar'dash : I would have been killed had you not come along, stranger. They have already murdered so many Kurenai in their search for a lost relic.What they seek is the totem of Kar'dash. Why they think that we would know anything about this totem, I cannot understand. Is a totem not an orcish implement by nature?This information must be taken back to Arechron. Perhaps he knows why Murkblood are kidnapping Kurenai and torturing them for information regarding an orcish device.Let's go before more come."
2019,"Bring Down the Warbringer! : We've made a lot of progress against the Shadow Council here at the Deathforge, but now it's time to finish the job.I found a key among the items in Kagrosh's pack. At least he accomplished something before they got to him.The key should help you to track down this Warbringer Razuun you observed at Legion Hold.After you've hunted down and dealt with Warbringer Razuun, report directly to Blood Guard Gulmok. We must not keep him waiting."
2020,"Adversarial Blood : The descendants held prisoner by the Skettis talonpriests are listed in this book: Gezzarak the Huntress, Karrog the crystal giant, the heretic known as Darkscreecher Akkarai and Vakkiz the Windrager.  They will all need to be slain before Terokk returns to this world.You will need the scrolls carried by the time-lost arakkoa to call them forth at the summoning circles in Skettis.  Bring me a token from each one.  These are powerful beings you will be facing; you would do well to bring friends."
2021,"Dissension Amongst the Ranks... : Gnomus was kind enough to put this concoction together for the final strike. I merely pour it upon this tabard that you have provided for me and the item is imbued with the essence of the Illidari filth.Take the enchanted tabard and travel to the Eclipsion Fields, southwest of Eclipse Point. Once there, use the tabard to transform into an agent of Illidan. While in disguise, slay the crazed colossi that wander the field. They will think it an attack by the Eclipsion and sever all ties!"

They have refused to pay for it.<name>, I would ask that you pay the blood elves of Manaforge Duro to the east a visit.  They appear to be having some trouble with an infestation of mana creatures there, so take advantage of their preoccupation.I care not what happens to them, but I would very much like to see the return of our property."
2023,Delivering the Message : I'm sending one of my demolitionists out to place the disruption device. Just make sure no harm comes to him as he's placing the disruptor.Keep him protected! He will not fight back if enemies attack him as he is only a holographic image but the image can be destroyed!Return to me once the job is done.
2024,"The Final Code : They're building a second mana bomb in the courtyard.  My intel suggests that the final code for the bomb is being held by Sharth Voldoun, the overseer of the project at Firewing Point.<name>, you have to go back in there and retrieve the final code from him.  He keeps himself to the top of the highest spire.Take the final code to the mana bomb that they're working on in the central courtyard and set it off.Only then will we be certain that Stonebreaker Hold is safe."
2025,"The Demoniac Scryer : The Demoniac Scryer is now ready.  Take it behind Hellfire Citadel, to Hellfire Basin, and summon it upon the ground.  It will then begin to attune itself to Hellfire Citadel.  After its attunement, speak to the Scryer and transcribe what it tells you.  Bring that transcription to me...Go, <name>, but only when you are ready.  There is no doubt that Hellfire Citadel will detect the Scryer and send wardens to destroy it!"
2026,"Oronok Torn-heart : I do not know how we can acquire the spell that the spirits mentioned, <name>. Truth be told, I don't even know where we would start such a search.<Torlok stares off in the distance, lost in thought.>Hrm... It is a long shot but it might be our only chance. There is an orc that I have seen visit this area before. I spoke to him briefly once. He is a hermit that claims to live above Coilskar Cistern to the northeast. Seek out this orc, Oronok Torn-heart.As I said, it is a long shot."
2027,"I See Dead Draenei : I see dead draenei. They're all around us.Bah, nobody believes me because I'm a child. Not even my own mommy believes me.<Ha'lei points to Ramdor.>He believes me, though... He sees them too. Boy does he get angry about it!It's kind of funny. I see ghosts and people just smile and pat me on the head, trying to placate me. Ramdor sees ghosts and people label him as crazy. I sure hope I never grow up!You should probably talk to Ramdor before you go inside. He was once a death priest."
2028,"Grim(oire) Business : There is one more gronn to be slain: Skulloc Soulgrinder.  He keeps himself hidden away, but there is a way to coax him forth.He was trained by an ogre warlock known as Vim'gol the Vile, whose grimoire you must retrieve!Vim'gol must be summoned by yourself, and four others, each standing within a different fire ring at his circle.

Poor, poor Altruis. He cry if he had eyes, yes?Yes, Sal'salabim help but first you help Sal'salabim.<Sal'salabim gives you a ledger.>These creatures owe Sal'salabim golds. Many golds. Go collect for Sal'salabim and come back. They no give you Sal'salabim gold easy. Have to fight, but you strong. You defeat Sal'salabim!"
2031,"Helboar, the Other White Meat : Those eggs are superb, but what do you say we kick it up another notch?A side of bacon would round out the meal perfectly and I know just where to get it.This place is littered with helboars. Of course, there's no one here to inspect and tenderize the meat, but we're in luck!<Legassi rummages around in his pack and produces a flask.>This wasn't made for use on pork, but cooking is as much about improvisation as anything else!"
2032,"The Eyes of Grillok : <name>, you have braved the lair of the Bleeding Hollow orcs, dreaded Zeth'Gor, and survived!  Perhaps you have the strength to aid me, for I aim to gaze into the mind of its darkest witch, Grillok!Take this shard.  Use it to ensorcel an Eye of Grillok and bind it to yourself.  Return here and approach my cauldron... and it will pull the eye from you.Go, <name>.  And use care -- An Eye of Grillok will betray you to our enemies if given the slightest opening!"
2033,"Distraction at Manaforge B'naar : We were sent here by the Sha'tar to investigate the manaforges that Kael'thas' army is operating here.  Unfortunately, the Scryers threaten to renege on their information-gathering duties unless we support them with military action.We can't afford to compromise this mission over politics, so we've agreed to weaken the manaforge's defenses so that the Scryers can do their work.Prove your loyalty to the Aldor and slay the Sunfury magisters and bloodwarders that guard Manaforge B'naar."
2034,"Escape from Coilskar Cistern : Thank the Earthmother! I parted ways with the others several days ago. I was intent on discovering the source of the disturbance that the spirits of water were feeling. My search led me to Coilskar where I discovered that the naga were befouling the water supply of Shadowmoon Valley.Unfortunately, I was discovered and taken prisoner. There's no telling what ghastly things they had in store for me.We must leave this place! Help me escape and then seek out Torlok at the Altar of Damnation."

It's got me a bit on edge.Tell you what, if you can prove your loyalty to Honor Hold and... bring me a mug of Nethergarde Bitter... yes, that sounds rather good about now... I'll have a deal to offer you then.Bernie at Nethergarde Keep keeps the bitter in stock."
2036,"On Spirit's Wings : If the Mok'Nathal are tormented by the Bloodmaul ogres, then I will stop them and their followers.

He may go undetected where we cannot."
2037,"Tear of the Earthmother : The sword's enchantments must be contained within a powerful focus, such as a gem. I know of a gem that we can use for this purpose, for there are few that can play host to such powerful magics without shattering.The gem we need is called the tear of the earthmother. It's a powerful artifact in the hands of the ogres who created it, and Warbringer O'mrogg, who currently holds the gem, has many powerful allies in Hellfire Citadel's Shattered Halls. Take care in retrieving the tear, <name>."
2038,"Stealing Back the Mushrooms : <class>, I've got an idea.   I want you to head north again, this time into the heart of ogre territory!Northwest of the Hewn Bog there is a place named Ango'rosh Stronghold, which sits on a floating island across a large mushroom bridge.The ogres must be storing the harvested mushrooms there.  I bet you'll find them all over the place, and probably on the ogres themselves, too!Bring me a sufficient number and I will try to do something about providing the bog lords with a new source of nourishment."
2039,"From the Abyss : My warp rift generator is complete. You can now use it to summon a true prince of the void, a creature whose soul shard will tell us much of what lies beyond.  Go south in Void Ridge and use my warp rift generator near the void stones.  Look for a cluster of crystals near the edge of the abyss.  A huge warp rift will form and Void Baron Galaxis will surely appear.  Destroy this creature and bring me his soul shard."
2040,Fresh from the Mechanar : Working with the ingots you brought is going to require a lot of heat -- rather more than a conventional forge can supply.I'm going to need a supplemental heat source for the forge and there are very few things in Outland that can supply that kind of power.The Mechanar area of Tempest Keep turns out manacells containing an incredible amount of power. Find one of the overcharged manacells from the stacks around Mechano-Lord Capacitus and bring it back here.
2041,"Colossal Menace : You see that huge red crystal to the north?  It fell from the sky not long ago, causing a massive earthquake.When we came out here to investigate the disturbance, we found all of these colossi wandering about that weren't previously here.There's definitely something strange about that crystal and the energies that it's emanating, but I don't have time for that.  Those mountain giants are my immediate concern.I want you to head up to Fallen Sky Ridge with some friends and deal with them."
2042,"Whelps of the Wyrmcult : I need to examine the whelps that they are raising at the Blackwing Coven.There should be an abundance of them flying around inside their cavernous base, as well as a number of eggs, which if you get close to them will likely hatch.Please, <name>, take the net and capture a handful of them alive for me.Find them by heading west across the Wyrmskull Bridge and heading through the Wyrmskull Tunnel.

I used to go up there with my friends, but my mom won't let me go anymore.She says it's too dangerous, but I haven't seen anything up there but a few little spiders. Like spiders can do anything to you...My favorites were always the eels that live up there. If you're going to be up by the lake, would you think about bringing back some of the eels? They're feisty but once you subdue 'em, you can bring 'em back no problem."

Such an assistant must be prepared...I am ashamed to admit that my prayer beads were lost in Honor Hold's courtyard.  I believe the dog Fei Fei stole them and buried them, but I do not know where.  If you speak with his master, Warrant Officer Tracy Proudwell, perhaps she will know where Fei Fei hides his stolen treasures."

You think you have what it takes to use it properly?Forge Camp: Wrath and Forge Camp: Terror, to the north and south, are a major pain in my backside, as well as being a threat to peaceful Ogri'la.

Take these bombs and knock out their ammo stacks.  Just don't let them shoot you down, too!"
2054,"The Umbrafen Tribe : The naga are terrible, yes.  But even more terrible are the traitor tribes of Broken and Lost Ones that helped them!The worst of all are the Lost Ones of the Umbrafen tribe; they use dark magic to trap and enslave others. They're especially cruel to escaped slaves and would slit my throat if I left the refuge even for a day.Travel to Umbrafen Village south of here and kill them and their leader, Kataru.  Until then I will fear for my life every single day."

These dreaded Broken were once powerful shaman who now defile the very elements they revered.Haalum, Corruptor of Air, can be found at Netherwing Pass.

I will see to it that you're rewarded properly."

Some of our people we found dead in the dark, others we could hear struggling against their captors. By morning we had come to this place and we fought a fierce battle but we were beaten.  Dreadfang poison will soon take my companions and I cannot last long.  Before I die I must know that the dreadfang widows were beaten."

See what you can do to help contain them."
2059,"A Heap of Ethereals : There is something else that I want your help with.A group of ethereals, known as the Zaxxis, have cut their relationship with the Consortium and gone into business for themselves.  They've even cut deals with the Sunfury blood elves.  This will not be tolerated!I infiltrated their group at the Heap to the south.  But after I took out their leader, I had to escape here to Area 52.<class>, go down there and bring back their insignias.  Of course, not all wear them because they're cowards."

My cousin Screed Luckheed promised me I would make a fortune, but instead he flew off in his zeppelin and left me here to try to scrape a living out of this mine.  How am I suppose to make a living here with helboars and demons and fel orcs attacking all the time?  My shredder here was broken yesterday and the parts I need to fix it were stolen by fel orcs.  They took the parts into the fissure to the southwest and may have dropped them there."

Should you accept this mission, I will assist by providing a reflection of myself as a guardian."
2072,"Strained Supplies : More and more refugees come through the gates of Shattrath City each day.  Some have sustained such injuries, it's a real wonder they made it here.I can deal with most of the conventional injuries; my training as an Aldor healer has prepared me for that.  Poison wounds are more problematic as my anti-venom supplies have begun to run low.Bring me venom sacs from the local dreadfang spiders so I can produce more antidotes.  You'll find a pocket of the spiders in the southeastern region of Terokkar."
2073,"Request for Assistance : While you were at the Arklon Ruins, I received a request for assistance from one of our representatives out in the field.

Once there, seek out the enslaved drakes and invoke the magic of the nethervine crystal. My own energies will pour forth, causing the drakes to break free from the bond of their captors.

2095,"Oronu the Elder : According to the tablets, an artifact known as a Medallion of Karabor was kept at Baa'ri.  Only the highest-ranking draenei priests were granted these, as they allowed unfettered access into the Temple of Karabor.We must find out whether the Ashtongue have recovered the medallion that was kept at Baa'ri yet.

2098,"The Sigil of Krasus : Before we departed Azeroth all those years ago, the Kirin Tor entrusted our expedition with a powerful artifact, the Sigil of Krasus. It was a great boon to us in our battle against the orcs and it could play a key role in helping me break the enchantment that imprisons me.However, when Kael'thas divested me of my possessions, he gave the sigil to Spellbinder Maryana, who remained behind with the garrison. If he truly realized what he had in his possession, he wouldn't have given it away so easily."
2099,"Body of Evidence : Your rampage through Kil'sorrow Fortress has provided us with a special opportunity. We have enough bodies to make it appear as if a great battle has taken place.Travel to the Laughing Skull Ruins and find the Laughing Skull Courtyard. There should be a blazing pyre in the courtyard. Make sure the area is secure and then use this blanket to send up smoke signals. When my ogres see the smoke, they will sneak in and plant the bodies of slain Kil'sorrow soldiers.That should be the final straw!"
2100,"When Spirits Speak : Oshu'gun - the diamond mountain - was once sacred to my people. It was there that the clans would gather every year to celebrate the springtime festival.

The ancestors turned their backs on us.Yet something now draws them from their rest. Venture to Oshu'gun and discover what could trouble the spirits so."

But the last time I was out on one of the islands in Marshlight Lake, I hooked a gigantic bogstrok that snapped my line and got away.Terrorclaw, he's called, and I won't rest until he's dead. He's too big for any fisherman to catch, so I suppose we'll just have to kill him the old-fashioned way."
2102,"Corki's Gone Missing Again! : <Arechron sighs.>This is so embarrassing. Do you remember my boy, Corki? You rescued him from the Burning Blade Ruins recently. Well, his curiosity has gotten the best of him once more.

2108,"Socrethar's Shadow : The infamous eredar, Socrethar, leads the Burning Legion in Netherstorm.  Mentioning his name is enough to make most draenei shudder.  He gives orders from an island in the northwest that only his most trusted lieutenants can access.To get there you will need to obtain a teleportation stone, which won't be an easy task.  The first half of the stone is in the possession of Forgemaster Morug at Forge Base: Oblivion.  The second half is held by Silroth at Forge Base: Gehenna."

2112,"Karabor Training Grounds : Our scouts have reported a massive influx of Sunfury blood elf recruits heading to the Ruins of Karabor.  Normally this would represent a purely military threat, however we believe something else is amiss.Descriptions of their attire and fighting style are suspiciously close to that of Illidan himself.  I do not want to become alarmed without good reason, so I would like you to go there and bring me back their weapons.  We will then determine whether my fears are unfounded or not."
2113,"A Necessary Distraction : The weapons are authentic, as we feared.  Illidan is training demon hunters at the Ruins of Karabor and we must put an end to it.Do not be fooled by their name, <name>, their power will be used against us as often as against any demon.Their warlocks summon and subdue demons to be used as part of the initiates' training.  A pit lord named Azaloth has proven too strong to be used in training and is kept banished.  Find a way to let him loose on his captors.  That should buy us the time we need."

2116,"The Shadow Tomb : Many believe it was the Shadow Council that caused the explosion that tore Auchindoun apart.  It is rumored they awoke a great evil inside.If that is true, then that evil must have turned against them.  According to these orders, part of the Shadow Council is fleeing Auchindoun.  They are using the Shadow Tomb to store powerful artifacts from Auchindoun.Three of these are sacred, for they belonged to the powerful patriarchs Arunen, K'alen and Atalor.  I must ask you to retrieve them."

They were to investigate the activities of Kael'thas and his minions, but we haven't received any reports of their findings yet.I worry that our presence in the area might not be strong enough to carry out the mission. I'm certain that the exarch could benefit from your knowledge and experience. Are you willing to travel to Area 52 and assist him?"
2119,"Void Ridge : We have to improve my warp rift generator.  You must take it to Void Ridge.  Head east of here.  You must avoid the foul fort of Zeth'Gor.  To the east beyond Zeth'Gor is a small pass through the mountains.

With their power we will improve upon the warp rift generator and open a portal to the beyond that cannot be closed."
2120,"What Strange Creatures... : I am interested in learning more about the strange reptiles that mill about the lava flows of Shadowmoon Valley. Never have I seen beasts able to withstand the searing heat of molten lava!Outside of Shadowmoon Village, where the ground has ruptured and lava flows through the cracks, you will find felfire diemetradons. Slay them and bring me their spleens. From their spleens I will be able to begin preliminary analysis of their resistance to heat.Begin your search to the southeast."
2121,"Who Are They? : I don't know who they are, but I know they're hostile!I'm going to give you a disguise, and I want you to go in there and speak with three of them that I've observed as being 'chatty'. Talk with the initiate, the laborer, and the advisor.Just watch out; there're a few hunters in there who'll be able to see through your disguise and they look tough! And whatever you do, don't leave the village -- the disguise is kind of flimsy. If you lose your disguise, come back to me and I'll give you another."
2122,"Ezekiel : I believe that the dead, which we have been caring for these last 500 odd years, should be left alone. Maladaar has other plans. He has retreated to the Crypt of Remembrance to start his experiments... Necromancy.I hope you weren't thinking about going in there... Not before helping me out so that these damned spirits will finally leave me alone. I know where they keep their treasures, <race>. Got your attention, eh?Bring me the book of the dead, held by the Aldor, Ezekiel of Shattrath."
2123,"The Foot of the Citadel : Force Commander Gorax is training Shattered Hand captains at the base of Hellfire Citadel, honing them to a bloody razor's edge.  You must kill him, <name>, for his loss would be a mighty blow to the fel orcs.However, that is not all you must do.Take this banner.  Place it atop Gorax's corpse.  Gorax's commander, the Hand of Kargath, must answer your challenge if he has even a drop of true orc blood within him!His head, the head of the hand of Kargath, is what I seek."
2124,"Mok'Nathal Treats : Hungry, <race>?  The Great Spirit helps those that help themselves.  If you want to earn a meal, I suggest that you listen up, because Braagor there isn't going to give you anything for free, nor as tasty!The raptors and scalewings of Razor Ridge and the Scalewing Shelf have everything that's needed for two of the most delicious dishes you'll ever taste.  Bring me their raptor ribs and serpent flesh, and I'll make some of each for you.I may even teach you how to cook them up for yourself, if you hurry."
2125,"The Ultimate Bloodsport : The queen of all that dwell in Nagrand is known as Tusker.  She's a giant elekk the likes of which you won't see anywhere else!You're right to be fearful of that name.  Bach'lor, Gutripper, and Banthar are nothing when compared to her.  It is said that she can be found on a huge bluff far to the southwest overlooking Oshu'gun.  Bring me her massive heart if you dare.Do you want to leave a letter with me so that I can have it delivered to your next of kin in the likely event that you don't return?"
2126,"The Archmage's Staff : Allow me to introduce myself, <class>.I am Ravandwyr, apprentice to the Archmage Vargoth.My master is... indisposed, shall we say. I am here on a matter of great importance.The Arklon Ruins southeast of the city are a hotbed of Burning Legion activity. Their purpose in the ruins concerns neither me nor my master, but their leader, Ekkorash, possesses the archmage's staff.This conjuring powder will allow you to draw the demon out of hiding. Sprinkle it on the brazier at the center of the ruins."
2127,"Banish the Demons : You've arrived at the perfect time, friend!  We are in need of assistance.  In return, you will receive something very rare, which will help us both in the end.We're not a violent ogre any longer, but the demons nearby threaten to overrun us and the Skyguard.  The problem with demons is that, once killed, they come right back in new bodies!But, if you use this crystal to summon a banishing portal, when they die near it, their essences will be drawn in and banished back from whence they came!"
2128,"Imbuing the Headpiece : The staff is nearly finished!All that remains is to imbue the headpiece with power flowing from the echoes of Gul'dan in this accursed place. To the east, near the Fel Pits and south of the Deathforge, is the Altar of Damnation.There, fragments of Gul'dan's past are trapped. When you carry the unfinished headpiece of the staff into the area around the altar, don't be surprised if some of the entities react to it. You will be carrying a dangerous object with strong connections to the cataclysm."
2129,"Welcoming the Wolf Spirit : I've nearly completed the vestments that I'll wear during the ceremony. As I add the finishing touches, I'd like you to set this incense by the candles near the runestone to my left.I believe it will help us to attract the wolf spirit's attention, since it was made in the days of the orcish clans. I can almost imagine my ancestors using it in a ceremony paying tribute to the wolf spirit after a successful hunt.Once you've placed the incense, I'll begin the ceremony."
2130,"Lohn'goron, Bow of the Torn-heart : It is a sign, <name>. Even in death, I cannot be stopped. Recovering a part of the Cipher of Damnation is my destiny. With your help, that destiny will be fulfilled.Before we embark on that journey, I must have my longbow, Lohn'goron. It is a family heirloom that has been handed down from Torn-heart to Torn-heart for generations.My instinct tells me that a demon stole it from my corpse. Kill the demons here until you find my bow."
2131,
2132,"Return to the Abyssal Shelf : <name>, are you ready for another sortie over the Abyssal Shelf?  I fear that, if we do not maintain pressure on the Legion forces there and allow them to strengthen their hold, then we may suffer a large demon attack from the north.What say you, <class>?  Do you want to take another windrider and hammer the Abyssal Shelf one more time?"
2133,"Mission: The Abyssal Shelf : Now that you've got your wings, perhaps you'd be interested in running another bombing mission?This time we've isolated the Legion's main production area, behind the forge camps to the north. I need you to get on a gryphon and destroy the whole damned thing!Here are your bombs - now, talk to Gryphoneer Windbellow when you're ready for takeoff."
2134,"Information Gathering : I've prepared a uniform with the pieces you obtained.  It is magically enhanced to complete the illusion.We spotted Commander Dawnforge going in to meet Arcanist Ardonis a few minutes ago.  He had a full retinue of guards with him, so whatever they're discussing is bound to be incredibly important; see if you can catch any of it.Oh, I almost forgot.  You'll want to stay away from the arcane golems patrolling the manaforge.  They will see right through the illusion."
2135,"Matters of Security : Gezhe chose to base our operations as close to Oshu'gun as possible, without any regard for the safety of our crew.  Why?  Because he projected a ten percent increase in productivity by setting up shop here instead of in the mountains to the south.Never mind the crazed voidspawn wandering all of ten feet away from us.  That would be the security officer's problem, not Gezhe's.Kill some voidspawn for me and I'll pay you a tenth of our security budget.  Don't get excited, it's not much of a budget."
2136,"Against All Odds : Some demons pledge allegiance to no one but themselves.  A true enemy of demons finds and destroys his prey regardless of affiliation, however.The demon Xeleth - a Legion defector - was once worshipped as a god by primitive swamp creatures in Zangarmarsh.  When Draenor was nearly destroyed, he retreated into a slumber deep beneath Marshlight Lake.  Find the portal at the lake and plant this spear into the ground.Xeleth will awake - be ready to slay him and prove you're an enemy to all demons."
2137,"It's Watching You! : Quick, hide!  The eyes of Naphthal'ar are upon you... upon us all!I dare not go to the top of the tower to speak with it, but you... you look as if you might know the right words to say.  Just be careful, it doesn't like jokes and will not suffer fools easily.If you can, convince it to come down for tea.  But, by all means, get it to stop staring at me!"
2138,
2139,"Evil Draws Near : Now you must use the Dread Relic in a foul necromantic ritual if you wish to challenge Teribus the Cursed.  To the northeast, beyond Auchindoun, is the Writhing Mound, a place where necromancers gather.  The auchenai death-speakers and doomsayers carry doom skulls that are laced with powerful necro-enchantments.  If you collect enough skulls you can use their power along with the power of the Dread Relic to command Teribus to face you."
2140,"Ill Omens : <name>, in our battles with the Bleeding Hollow clan of fel orcs, we have found upon them foreboding trinkets.  These orcs have collected the insignias of fallen Honor Hold soldiers and created cursed talismans from them.  We fear the dark magic of the Bleeding Hollow orcs have transformed our insignias into evil charms with powers against us!Find such a talisman from the Bleeding Hollow orcs of Zeth'Gor, to the east, and bring it to Corporal Ironridge at Expedition Point, northeast of Zeth'Gor."
2141,"Shizz Work : I finally got my shredder working but I seem to have lost the keys.  I keep a pack of felhounds to protect my camp.  They don't do a very good job and they like to bite me a lot.  They also like shiny things.  I think this one felhound I have may have eaten my shredder keys.  I'll pay you if you'll take my felhound on a walk.  Kill some helboars and let him eat.  He'll do his business.  When he's done, see if you can't find the keys in his ""leavings."""
2142,"Slay the Brood Mother : My hunters have just returned from a scouting mission to the Singing Ridge.  It seems that the nether drakes, which infest the crystals there, have increased greatly in number, and threaten to spill out into our laps.Since you have proven yourself a competent slayer, let us see if your <class> skills are the match of an adult drake.Find the Singing Ridge by heading south through the Scalewing Shelf.  Enter and slay their brood mother, Dreadwing."
2143,"Clefthoof Mastery : You want to earn a place in this safari?  You'll have to prove yourself.I don't care what you've hunted before, you haven't hunted until you hunt what we hunt here.  Start with the clefthoof if you're <man/tough> enough.I know that I've seen them in the immediate area around the safari and also close by to the south."
2144,"Breaching the Path : We're going to need more time, <race>. I'm going to fly further ahead with some of the other wind riders. Hopefully, we can gather some more information. What I need from you now is to clear a path and more importantly, keep their arrows pointed away from us!Call for a wind rider with the Kor'kron flare gun once you have thinned their numbers."
2145,"Escape from Umbrafen : You must help me get out of here!I was gathering herbs nearby when a handful of these little savages abducted me.  I tried to fight them off, but there were too many of them.Help me return to the Cenarion Refuge and away from these cruel wretches and their vile magic!"
2146,
2147,"Success! : For many years, Boulderfist ruled all ogres in the Outland. The ogres were united under Krol and content with the lands that they were given. In the past few months, we have lost many ogres to a new clan known as Warmaul. Warmaul has taken most of our land in Nagrand and killed many of our people.We had no choice but to take this town. We are being exterminated...Krol has gone missing and Boulderfist is in turmoil. Lantresor of the Blade rules in his absence."
2148,"A Secret Revealed : As my energies bled away over the centuries, a void slowly grew in my place - devouring the souls of those nearby. Helplessly, I watched as generations of orc souls were drawn into the vortex. Recently, my enemies harnessed the vortex and used it to draw countless void minions into their Burning Legion.Now, the key to ending this cycle and freeing the orc spirits lies with another naaru - A'dal. I have sensed his essence within the ancient city of Shattrath in the Terokkar Forest."
2149,"As the Crow Flies : We must determine how widespread the naga's activity truly is and react accordingly.Exploring each body of water in Zangarmarsh could be a lengthy undertaking.  If you allow me to, I will use my magic to mold your shape to one more suited to scouting the marsh.Hold this amulet above the balcony near me when you're ready to begin.  I will guide your way back to safety after we're done."
2150,"A Burden of Souls : I have a device, the Demoniac Scryer, that can analyze fel magic.  I would have you use the Scryer, but first... you must appease it.  The Scryer, you see, has trapped within it a creature of vast intelligence and its needs are, shall we say, quite eccentric.To appease the Scryer, you must kill orcs.  Specifically, they must be Shattered Hand orcs -- the Scryer demands their souls.Return to me when the souls are reaped.  You will find the orcs north, and south, and surrounding... Hellfire Citadel."
2151,"The Warden's Cage : The fragments you obtained are only half of the medallion.  The Ashtongue leader, Akama, must have kept the other half.I dread to ask this of you, as Akama is both evil and cunning.He and the Ashtongue Deathsworn - the vilest and most brutal of the tribe - are rumored to run a torture chamber inside the Warden's Cage.I want you to find that dreaded prison,  and find the whereabouts of Akama.  His second in command at the location is a Broken known as Sanoru - interrogate him if you have to."
2152,"The Heart of Darkness : It is just as I feared. Arix'Amal - the demon you killed earlier, was working for a secret Legionlord - Arazzius the Cruel. It appears this new villain has amassed a force of hellish terrorfiends near the Pools of Aggonar. You must journey there and slay the terrorfiends before they strike against us. But be wary, friend - the Pools of Aggonar lie within a tortured, poisonous valley. You can find the cursed pools to the northwest of here, beyond Hellfire Citadel. Light be with you, <name>."
2153,"Dragonmaw Race: Corlok the Vet : You are challenging ME? Don't make me laugh!You're serious? Very well then! All you need to do is not die. You can manage to not die, right?? Even if I'm hurling skulls at you and flying circles around your pathetic riding skills?Just let me know when you're ready and we'll lift off."
2154,
2155,"By Any Means Necessary : I don't know what to make of all of this, but I do know how we can find more clues.Empoor is a Broken merchant that traffics in all sorts of goods and information.  If you were to persuade him to talk, I'm sure he might have something interesting to say.He travels the road here between Tuurem and Shattrath.  Watch out, though -- he travels with a bodyguard."
2156,"Prisoner of the Bladespire : Shortly after my arrival in the mountains, I came under attack by a group of Bladespire ogres.Though I fought free of them, and slew many, they took my wyvern, Leokk, captive. Spirit has found him, locked in a cage in the heart of the Bladespire encampment outside of Gruul's lair.One of the ogres must carry his key. Find it and Spirit can use it to unlock Leokk's cage.You will find the encampment at the north end of the Daggermaw Canyon down below."
2157,"Hero's Call: Outland! : By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Commander Duron in Hellfire Peninsula.The expeditionary forces require your help to overcome the demonic armies of the Burning Legion! Talk to the Honor Hold Mage in the tall tower in the Mage District to travel to Blasted Lands, then walk through the Dark Portal to arrive at the Stair of Destiny.For the glory and honor of the Alliance!"
2158,"Dragonmaw Race: Trope the Filth-Belcher : Dragonmaw treat you right, <name>. Even a worn out cursed being like me is given a chance. Now if you want to prove your worth to the Skybreakers, you will have to defeat me.I'm going to shake you off my tail like a bad case of fleas...We'll lift off when you are ready."
2159,"Balance Must Be Preserved : I cannot begin to comprehend why the naga would drain the water out of their own habitat.  What I do understand is a need to put a stop to their operations.These seeds carry with them the rage of the earth.  Take them to the steam pumps operated by the naga and use them on their controls.The vines that grow from the seeds will be as thick as your arm and as strong as iron.  Go, <name>.  Restore the balance that the naga have upset."
2160,"Avruu's Orb : <As you hold the orb closer to you, you hear a voice address you.>I sense you're not of the arakkoa, so I will attempt to barter for my freedom.  My name is Aeranas. I once ruled over the eastern winds.  The Haal'eshi mage, Avruu, trapped me inside this orb.Find the altar the arakkoa used to enslave me.  It is hidden to the southeast of the arakkoa's den.  Approach it with the orb and give it to me once I'm free.  In exchange for my liberty I'll reward you with powerful treasure!"
2161,"Secrets of the Talonpriests : Thank you for paying heed to my fevered rants.  All along we had been trying to identify and destroy the Skettis chain of command; we had learned of three clerics known as the talonpriests, but we'd never seen them with our own two eyes.  Now we know why.Talk to Severin to obtain more of the elixir he discovered.  Use the elixir to find and kill the three talonpriests: Ishaal, Skizzik and Zellek.  They're rumored to dwell in Veil Ala'rak, near the eastern shore of Blackwind Lake."
2162,"Doorway to the Abyss : You are an honor to us, <name>. But now we must strike before the Legion recovers! To the north of Thrallmar lies Invasion Point: Annihilator. It houses a warp-portal through which the Legion draws its reinforcements. You must overload that portal - and blast it back to the abyss it came from. The portal's activation key will be held by the Point's commander - Warbringer Arix'Amal. Slay him. Take the key. Use it on the portal and do what must be done. May the warchief's blessings be with you."
2163,"Fel Spirits : Colonel Jules was cursed in a battle near the Gor'gaz Outpost, a haunt for Shattered Hand fel orcs.  My master, Barada, works feverishly to cure the poor human, but he needs help.  The Colonel's tormented spirit seeks peace, and his path to peace is, I fear, a path of vengeance.Take this anchorite relic to Gor'gaz Outpost.  Place it upon the ground near Shattered Hand orcs and defeat them.  This will release their fel spirits -- you must slay those fel spirits for Jules' own spirit's recovery."
2164,"Windroc Mastery : Do you live for the hunt as I do, <class>?  Do you seek the quietude that comes as you stalk your prey?  Would you know what it is to honor the last heartbeats of your fallen quarry?  I will help you to achieve this.Nagrand is a lush land, full of life in the midst of this broken world.  Bring down a handful of the windrocs and then we will speak more.You can find them in many places nearby in all directions around our camp."
2165,"Material Components : Mother Kashur wishes to speak with you, <name>. Before this becomes possible, you must collect the herbs required to create a potion that will expand your mind, allowing you to commune with the spirits.You must gather Olemba root from Terokkar, marshberries from Zangarmarsh, Telaari fronds from Nagrand and dragonspine from the Blade's Edge mountains. I have written down instructions on this parchment as to the cultivation of these herbs. Return to me when you have gathered the materials."
2166,A Lesson Learned : We need to show those flayers what happens when you mess with Oronok's business!I want you to go back to the Shattered Plains and destroy every flayer egg that you see. They'll be deep in flayer territory so keep your guard up.
2167,"Maggoc's Treasure Chest : On the Razor Ridge, above and to the southeast, Maggoc patrols.  His father assigned him as the warden of the eastern mountain range, and he revels in terrorizing any creature that gets in his way.As a son of Gruul, he must be done away with if my clan is to survive.  That's where you come in.Maggoc carries a treasure chest with him at all times.  Prove to me that he has been slain by bringing me his precious chest.  Feel free to keep whatever you find within it."
2168,"The Skyguard Outpost : <name>, we were wondering if you might be willing to visit our friends just to the north at the Skyguard Outpost?Sky Commander Keller and his Skyguard are here running missions for our mutual protection, and he's asked us to send along anyone that we feel would excel at helping out.That would be you!Head up there as soon as you can, and please, give him our regards."
2169,"HELP! : HELP! They're gonna eat me! I just know it!Find the key, I know it has to be on one of these ogres.If you get me out of here, my father will reward you handsomely! He's the leader of Telaar, Arechron."
2170,
2171,"Damaged Mask : As you examine the damaged mask, you hear strange sounds coming from within. If the mask wasn't damaged you might be able to hear the sounds more clearly.O'Mally Zapnabber in Ruuan Weald might be able to fix the mask."
2172,"A Cleansing Light : This temple is one of the holiest places in all of Outland.  The power of the Light here is so strong, that even items with the strongest fel taint can be cleansed of a worldly item.Should you run into any fel armaments in your confrontations with demonic enemies, bring them to me and I will demonstrate the cleansing power of the Light."
2173,"Mission: The Murketh and Shaadraz Gateways : Just west of the Dark Portal are two huge transporters: Gateway Murketh and Gateway Shaadraz.If you look east up the Path of Glory, you'll see them on either side of the road.  I want you to bomb them both into rubble!Here are the bombs you'll use, specially designed by a goblin in Area 52.  Now, speak with Wing Commander Dabir'ee -- he'll put you on a gryphon and send you on your way."
2174,Speak with Mog'dorg : <King/Queen> <name>!  You speak with Mog'dorg the Wizened before you leave and go to Ogri'la!
2175,"Wrangle More Aether Rays! : So, I hope that you're up to helping us wrangle up even more aether rays!  From what I can see, you're a natural with the rope!  And it's for a good cause, because not only do we get fresh mounts, but it helps us to protect Ogri'la, which the ogres appreciate.Remember, the aether rays fly around Vortex Pinnacle, and the Crystal Spine to the northeast.Think you can wrangle me up some more?"
2176,"Ortor My Old Friend... : These invasion plans were written by someone I once knew. Ortor of Murkblood, once a noble Broken, versed in the way of the elements, now a muck addled yes-man of Musel'ek the bog lord.The plans state that they have taken over an orc village northwest of here known as Sunspring.Travel to Sunspring Post and rid the world of Ortor of Murkblood. What you do, you do for the good of us all..."
2177,Enraged Spirits of Water : The Illidari naga of the region have taken control of the only clean water supply that exists in Shadowmoon Valley.Directly north of here you will find the lair of the naga: Coilskar. Around Coilskar are pockets of agitated water that howl to the land in anguish. It is at those pockets that the enraged spirits of water now wander.Travel to Coilskar and use the totem of spirits to capture watery souls. You will find the largest concentration of these spirits near Coilskar Cistern.
2178,"Warning the Cenarion Circle : The Cenarion Expedition has become a large organization with a good degree of autonomy.  These events are important enough that we need to warn the Cenarion Circle.Do not worry, I will not ask you to travel back to Moonglade; we have emissaries as nearby as Hellfire Peninsula."
2179,
2180,"Voren'thal's Visions : Our leader, Voren'thal the Seer, was once a close advisor to Kael'thas.  His prophetic visions warned him that Kael's path would lead to the destruction of our race.The visions are usually vague and unfocused, but our alchemists have devised an elixir to help him focus his clairvoyance.  Unfortunately, this elixir calls for a rare ingredient: basilisk eyes.  My usual source, this pathetic ethereal, has failed me.Seek the dampscale basilisks in the rocky regions of Terokkar and bring me their eyes."
2181,Altruis : You don't see many demon hunters nowawdays.  They're viewed with suspicion by their own people and it's very rare to find one that doesn't have some sort of allegiance to Illidan.There are rumors of one such demon hunter out in Nagrand.  His name is Altruis.  He hates all demons with a passion and will help us if you can convince him that you share his goals.Go to western Nagrand and find him.  He might be willing to shed some light on these new demon hunter training grounds.
2182,"Mission: Gateways Murketh and Shaadraz : We've identified the two main transporters that the Burning Legion are using to bring in reinforcements: Gateway Murketh and Gateway Shaadraz.If you look east up the Path of Glory, you'll see them on either side of the road.  I want you to bomb them both into oblivion!Here are the bombs you'll use, specially designed by a goblin in Area 52.  Now, speak with Wing Commander Brack -- he'll put you on a wyvern."
2183,"Blessing of Incineratus : The wretched Lost Ones, heretofore banished to the swamps of Zangarmarsh, are seeking to spread their filth to other parts of our world.I have sought the wisdom of the furies and gained their blessing. To stop the source, we must unleash the elements upon them!I give you living fire, plucked from the fiery essence of Incineratus himself. Travel to Windyreed Village, southeast of here, and unleash the living fire upon their huts! Let them see the fury of the elements!"
2184,"Disturbance at Umbrafen Lake : We came to Outland expecting to find small pockets of life.  What we discovered in Zangarmarsh was a lush environment with a thriving ecosystem.Our initial assessment of the area was deceiving, however.  The water levels at the lakes and marshes have consistently been going down since we started taking measurements.The impact this could have on the local animal and plant life is disastrous.  Go to Umbrafen Lake, southwest of here, and look for clues related to this water depletion."
2185,Skywing : Skywing flutters around you.You get the feeling he wants you to follow him.
2186,"Grulloc Has Two Skulls : To the east, at the terminus of Dragons' End, is the Cursed Hollow.  Therein, Grulloc, son of Gruul, plots his dimwitted schemes.I heard that one of his possessions was stolen from him through trickery.  Was that you?  Unfortunate that he was not slain in the process.If we are to regain our freedom, I would have you take his most prized possession, a dragon skull from when he rejoiced in his father's slaying of the Black Dragonflight.  The only way you'll get the skull is to vanquish him."
2187,"To Rule The Skies : As ye've flown around, ye must have noticed the dragons above.  I trust ye haven't fallen victim ta their rage.  Help us put an end ta it, <name>!Rivendark and Obsidia lord over this terrace, while Insidion and Furywing rule the skies over yon terrace ta the northeast.  Each has a perch on their respective domains.  I be wondering if ye and yer friends will go ta one, <lad/lass>, break open an egg and attract the dragon down.Bring me some teeth as proof.  Ta rule the skies, it's either them or us."
2188,"Triangulation Point Two : I've recalibrated the triangulation device with the information that you provided from the first point.  You'll use it in exactly the same manner to discover the second.All that I can tell you is that the second point is somewhere far to the west.Once you've located it, speak with Wind Trader Tuluman; another of the nexus-prince's agents.  He's posing as a weapon merchant at a small trading post next to the bridge, which leads to the island that Manaforge Ara is on."
2189,"Ata'mal Armaments : The Ata'mal Terrace in eastern Shadowmoon Valley is holy to the draenei, but is now overrun by fel orcs. They have dug up the special ore from that place and created corrupted weapons and armor.I need the armaments to form an alloy with the naga ore. Our anchorites have blessed my anvil with the ability to cleanse them.Retrieve the armaments from the Shadowmoon chosen, slayers and darkweavers. Return them here, breaking down and purifying them upon my anvil, and then hand me the cleansed results."
2190,"Tabards of the Illidari : The gryphon riders must return to Wildhammer Stronghold to prepare for the next phase of our assault. What I need from you now are the tabards that these blood elves wear.When you have collected enough tabards, call for a gryphon rider using the Wildhammer flare gun. Prepare yourself for a bit of espionage, <race>!"
2191,"Destroy Naberius! : Archmage Vargoth saw the danger in Naberius's pursuit of necromancy, but I don't think he ever anticipated that his own apprentice would wreak this much destruction upon the Kirin Tor.You must defeat him, <name>, or else he will continue enslaving the spirits of our fallen brothers, robbing them of their rightful rest and destroying what little remains of Kirin'Var.With his phylactery in hand, he can be confronted by two or three combatants, but who knows what his magic might do to more foes?"
2192,"The Hermit Smith : <Ordinn examines the results from his attempt at smithing the metal and shakes his head.>This is beyond my ability, but that's not to say the weapon can't be recreated for your use.There was a talented smith who accompanied the Sons of Lothar to Draenor, David Wayne. He was a remarkable blacksmith, but chose to leave the expedition. These days, he lives in a small camp on a peninsula east of Firewing Point in Terokkar Forest. Take the ingots to him and see if he can help you with the weapon."
2193,"Blast the Infernals! : The device we've assembled won't win any beauty contests, but it should be capable of destroying the infernals amassed at Legion Hold. Judging from what the fel reaver power core's energy did to the Fetid Pool, it holds a respectable amount of explosive power.If you set the device off in the middle of the green glyph at the hold, it should be in range to hit all of the infernals."
2194,"Teron Gorefiend - Lore and Legend : Stories abound about the life of Teron Gorefiend, but most are just that - stories. We do not know what happened to Gorefiend after he returned to Draenor.The only thing we are certain of is that he has already died once.I have heard the scouts here speaking of an ancient orc spirit that resides at the Altar of Shadows, far to the southeast, across the Netherwing Fields and through Netherwing Pass. Take the Spectrecles and track this orc down. He will surely have more information on Gorefiend."
2195,"Recharging the Batteries : I have the very important task of collecting the machinery inside these ruins, but I'm having a problem keeping all of my bots charged up.The phase hunters - those wyrm-looking things - have lots of energy!  You can find them all over the edges of this island, floating in from the nether.Fill the battery on this recharging blaster by using it on a phase hunter when they're very weak, and then finish it off to soak up the last of its energy."
2196,
2197,"A Friendly Gesture : Life in the marsh has not been easy, <name>. We want to live in harmony with those that call it home, but our enemies out here threaten our existence.  Work with us. Help the people of Sporeggar thrive."
2198,"Demonic Crystal Prisons : From assessing the scene, you note that Ar'tor is being held in place by energy beams emanating from the crystals hovering around the rune. Try as you might, Ar'tor is unmovable.You note that the crystals have an empty slot at their base - perhaps for a key. It also seems as if succubi periodically perform some sort of ritual at the site.Search Illidari Point for their leader. Perhaps she holds the key to releasing Ar'tor."
2199,"Exorcising the Trees : The Grishna have caused the leafbeards and stonebarks to be inhabited by evil koi-koi spirits.We must save the trees or soon all of the Raven's Wood will be lost forever!Combine the magic of a Grishnath orb, found throughout Grishnath, with a dire pinfeather from a dire raven.Use the resultant exorcism feather to draw out and slay the koi-koi spirit as quickly as possible.  The stonebarks are too powerful for this ritual, but if enough leafbeards are saved, they will be freed as well."
2200,"Akama : You've proven what side you're on.  I will reveal to you our leader's hideout.Follow the halls beyond; there will be an underground passage hidden by stagnant water on your right.I must warn you, <name>.  You are not to speak to anyone of what you see there."
2201,"A Father's Duty : As to that other magical flask, it can only be obtained from one spot: Bash'ir Landing.  It's an ethereal base, and they aren't too friendly with outsiders, so it might be a little dangerous to obtain.Where's Bash'ir Landing, you ask?  Well, if you get on your flying steed and head north by northeast, well past Forge Camp: Wrath, you'll eventually spot it.  The Bash'ir crystalforge itself is at the northeast corner of the landing.Thank you for doing this, <name>.  It'll mean the world to our sons!"
2202,"Murkblood Corrupters : Murkblood are capturing and torturing the spirits of air! Murkblood are my kin: A tribe of the Broken who serve the vile Musel'ek, beast lord of Coilfang.The air spirit states that the Murkblood putrifiers are capturing other spirits of air and using them to sow chaos into the ranks of the elements. It would seem that the Murkblood have recently sacked an orc village to the southwest known as Sunspring and are using powerful elemental magic to disturb the lake. Find the putrifiers and destroy them."
2203,"Curse of the Violet Tower : Now, you will be able to use the archmage's staff to contact him.He resides in the Violet Tower, on an 'island' to the southeast. The tower is both sanctuary and prison to him, cursed as it is. Kirin Tor can neither enter nor leave, keeping me apart from my master.The staff's magic can penetrate the tower's defenses, but only if invoked by one outside the Kirin Tor.Take the archmage's staff and use it to conjure his image. Tell him what has happened and that I have not completely failed him."
2204,"Veil Shalas: Signal Fires : Terokk's perch, Skettis, looms above the Bone Wastes to the east. At the base of Skettis lies Veil Shalas, the most formidable of Terokk's colonies. It is through the stronghold of Veil Shalas that Terokk's forward sages wage war against the Light.The evil-doers of Shalas communicate with their master using a complex system of magical signal fires. Travel to the east, <race>, and extinguish the fires. Once Veil Shalas is silenced, we can begin to plot the fall of Skettis.But I get ahead of myself."
2205,The Infested Protectors : The trees of this land are ravaged by the power that was unleashed from Auchindoun.  The foul magic that was unleashed blasted the land into the wastes you see all around.  The trees that survived are now infested with wretched wood mites that crawl under their bark and gnaw at their flesh.  Rotting forest-rages and infested root-walkers are breeding grounds for the mites.  They are found along the edge of the wood to the east.  Destroy these creatures and then kill the mites that flee their husks.
2206,"A Gift for Voren'thal : I don't want to send you to Voren'thal empty-handed.  It's not in my style to be underwhelming.To gain access to Socrethar's Seat in the north, we'll need to use his own teleporters - locked by Socrethar's teleportation stone.  The first half of the stone is in the possession of Forgemaster Morug at Forge Base Oblivion.  The second half is held by the demon Silroth at Forge Base: Gehenna.Obtain these and Voren'thal will be impressed beyond words."
2207,An Audacious Advance : Directly west of here you will find the Halaani Basin. Within the basin are the twin clefts of Nagrand: Northwind and Southwind. Boulderfist shock troops use the clefts to hide their ogre mounds.I need you to track down those troops and kill all that you encounter in the name of Mag'har.
2208,S-A-B-O-T-A-G-E : We must destroy the machinery that is making these nexus-stalker aberrations possible. To strike at their proto-accelerator would be futile as it is an ethereal creation. We must instead destroy the manaforge energy tube that they are using as a conduit.I have all that I need to create a device to overload the conduit save for one item. I need a wrapping from an archon or overlord that might be transforming soon in order to calibrate the device.
2209,"Escape from Skettis : Hail, <name>.  I thank you for coming to my aid.The arakkoa's monstrous birds knocked me from my nether ray while on a scouting mission.Let's get out of here, while we can."
2210,"The Warp Rifts : Long have I wandered through Outland, searching for the truth of the void.  Now I am old and weak.  Perhaps you will help me? I must learn the secrets of the voidwalkers.  You must find the Warp Fields to the west.  West of the Expedition Armory there is a dark place on the edge of the abyss where time and space are weak.  Use my unstable warp rift generator in the Warp Fields to create a warp rift.  You must gather warp nether from the creatures that come through."
2211,"Invasion Point: Cataclysm : Now that we have access to the Legion's base at Invasion Point: Cataclysm, we need to figure out a way to shut down their operations there. Shadowmoon Village won't be safe until the Legion's presence is erased from the valley.I've sent an advance party up to the invasion point to help you formulate a plan to destroy the Legion's supplies. Go back to Legion Hold and step into the teleporter with the green crystals above it. Nakansi will meet you at your destination."
2212,"Capturing the Keystone : It doesn't surprise me that Kael'thas has put the key to this ward in the hands of someone like Commander Sarannis. Prince Kael'thas is a great many things, but he is no simpleton.In order to break this curse once and for all, you must enter Tempest Keep and claim the keystone.Only once the keystone has been destroyed will I regain my freedom."
2213,"Shutting Down Manaforge B'naar : I was having a friendly discussion with the Aldor while you were gone.  Manaforges sure look like modified naaru technology from Tempest Keep.  Apparently, most naaru constructs have certain safeguards that allow them to be permanently disabled in case of emergency.The procedure is usually initiated at a control console via an access crystal.  Lo and behold, according to the roster you secured, such a crystal is in the possession of a fellow called Overseer Theredis.  Obtain it and see what you can do."
2214,"The Sporelings' Plight : You there!  You must help us!The fungal giants are devouring all of our spore sacs!  You must do something, or we'll lose our young!The spore sacs start out large and become smaller as the air inside them is depleted.  Look for the small, mature spore sacs and save as many of them as you can!"
2215,"Terokkarantula : You have slain many of the dreadfang widows but they will continue to spawn and soon they will strike at us again.  Deep within Netherweb Ridge is the lair of the Terokkarantula, the brood-mother of these gruesome creatures.  If we are to be safe, she must die."
2216,"Frankly, It Makes No Sense... : We must study these creatures further.Far to the east - near the huge lava flow beneath the ruins of Baa'ri - you will find arcano control units. These controllers were crafted by a genius named Gnomus for the sole purpose of exploring lava via mechanical scorpion.He has long since lost his mind and is now only interested in eating the hottest food known to gnome-kind.<Tiorus gives you a funny look.>I want you to use the control and tag the diemetradons of the lava flow for further study."
2217,"Have You Ever Seen One of These? : This marsh be missin' one thing, mon! There be no murlocs here.Don't worry, mon, I got a plan to fix the problem. See Gargle 'n' Gurgle over there? I plan to give the gift o' murlocs to the Lost Ones!Take this cage with you to Daggerfen Village an' release 'em in the northeastern cluster of huts. Now you know I can't be riskin' Gargle 'n' Gurgle with you, but I'll give you a cage full o' colorful young murlocs. Just set it on the flat rock you be findin' up there and open the door!"
2218,"The Mag'har : This news you bring from beyond the Dark Portal...  you want us to believe the son of Durotan now rules over the lands beyond it... free from any demonic taint?  And that now his people have returned to this world?I hope for your sake that this isn't some manner of joke, <class>.  What this means to my people... cannot be described.  I must send word to Nagrand at once!  Hellscream must hear about this.Take this letter back to your leader in Thrallmar.  Tell him the Mag'har welcome them!"
2219,"In Case of Emergency... : In the event of an emergency, it's always the pilot's job to keep a level head, especially when the only orders your co-pilot follows come from his stomach.The good news is that we won't need to wait days for replacement parts to be imported. The bad news is that the ""spare"" parts got scattered from here to the Valley of Bones to the east.The other bad news? The spare parts aren't so spare. They, uh, fell off during our rapid descent. Could you help me collect enough to get us off the ground again?"
2220,"Capture the Weapons : With a larger supply of this material, I can forge a weapon suitable for you.The two pit lords at Legion Hold, Makazradon and Morgroron, have already been equipped with these anti-demon weapons. Capturing those two weapons should provide us with enough material to make your weapon, and then some.I can't wait to bring the battle to the enemy using these weapons. That'll teach the Legion to trifle with anti-demon magics."
2221,"Underworld Loam : The frame that you brought me earlier will not be sufficient to hold molten metal without reinforcement. A rare kind of earth can be used to cool and imbue the frame, giving the adamantite an unnatural strength.Underwold loam, as the earth is known, is accorded great value among the naga. Few enough of them possess it, and in Outland, I know of only one naga who uses it -- Hydromancer Thespia, who resides in the Steamvault of Coilfang Reservoir."
2222,"The Outcast's Plight : As an outcast, I am marked by death by arakkoa loyal to the city of Skettis.  I cannot leave these walls for fear of my life, but that doesn't mean I cannot strike at them in retaliation.I have a small cache of treasure that I'm willing to part with, should you help me strike back at my would-be assassins.  Bring me feathers from the denizens of the various Veils of Terokkar as proof of their demise."
2223,"A Head Full of Ivory : Ivory is a much sought after prize.  I have many customers lined up in far off places to purchase it.I could be convinced to let you in on a cut of the profits.The wild elekk roaming Nagrand have the high quality of tusks that I'm after.  Steer clear of the bull elekk; their ivory isn't in the condition that I desire.Oh and don't worry, it's not poaching; I have an understanding with both the orcs and the draenei.Do you and I have an understanding?"
2224,"Fhwoor Smash! : Little naga make Fhwoor angry!  Sporelings good friend to Fhwoor, so Fhwoor get naga ark.We go into nearby naga village.  You help?  Bring friends!"
2225,"Grom'tor, Son of Oronok : My first born, Grom'tor, left to search Coilskar Point - directly southwest of here.He's the warrior in the family - ill-tempered and blood-thirsty... Traits he inherited from his mother. Search along the outskirts of Coilskar Point. If you see naga corpses, Grom'tor is sure to be close.When you find him, tell him this: ""We spill blood for just cause."" It will let him know that you are a friend to Torn-heart and prevent your premature death."
2226,"The Fate of Kagrosh : The scouting party originally had three members. Unfortunately, Kagrosh decided he wanted to be a hero.He descended into the Deathforge and we haven't heard from him since.In all likelihood, the fool's gone and gotten himself killed. The Shadow Council members aren't idiots and Kagrosh wasn't exactly strong in the subtlety department, if you know what I mean. Keep an eye out for him in the Deathforge and recover any information or items he might have collected."
2227,"Getting Down to Business : As you've no doubt seen, the area is teeming with nether dragons in various stages of growth. All nether dragons, young and old, contain an essence that's highly desired by K -- err, by a client of mine.Most people aren't willing to risk their lives to gather it, so we've got the place to ourselves. You can start by gathering the essence from any of the creatures out here, but it's imperative that we start building a supply right away. Return to me once you have the first batch."
2228,"When the Cows Come Home : Realizing that Bessy is still staring at you, you gesture toward Thadell's location. You find yourself promising to protect the cow on her way home. Upon finishing your sentence, you realize there's no possible way the cow could understand anything you've said.Shrugging your shoulders, you prepare to guard the bovine on her way back to Thadell."
2229,"Familiar Fungi : Yes, that's it, I knew I had seen this particular phylum of mushroom elsewhere in the marsh!To the north is a place known as the Hewn Bog.  Odd name for the place if you ask me, but I've never been there.  I'll need samples of those mushrooms to confirm my hypothesis.Just be careful, <class>.  I'd heard that ogres have moved in to the area, so you'll have to get the samples from them.  Could that be why the bog lords are no longer going there for their food?"
2230,"Recover the Bones : The bones of the dead draenei litter the Bone Wastes from the explosion of Auchindoun.  Their spirits are restless, and cannot move on to the next life.<class>, you must help me to recover their bones and take them to their final resting place!  Only then will they be at peace; only then will they know comfort.Gather up the restless bones with care and deliver them to Ramdor the Mad at Auchindoun in the center of the Bone Wastes.  Despite his name, he will know how to care for them."
2231,"Cutting Your Teeth : It's nice that you've been helping out Toshley and his scientists.  I, however, do not have the luxury of indulging in my 'personal' interests.If you want to make a difference around here, you'll do what I ask of you, and right now, I need weapons.Our guns are effective at range, but when the bugs get in close, we need to have powerful melee weapons as a backup.The teeth of the daggermaw lashtails in the northern part of the Razor Ridge make for great vibro-weapon blades.  Scare me up some."
2232,"The Ring of Blood: The Warmaul Champion : They had to ship the champion in from the Blade's Edge gladiator pits. He was training on mountain giants - three at a time.If you win this one, you become the new champion. What do you think your odds are, kid? Do you have a shot? Just give me the word and I'll bet the house on you.Now get in there and win!"
2233,"Unlocking the Compendium : While I'm glad to have most of Krasus's Compendium back, it's useless without the heliotrope oculus. You see, Krasus was well aware of the sheer power of the spells recorded in the book and took steps to safeguard them from prying eyes.Only a knowledgeable mage can use the oculus to unlock the compendium's secrets.During Kael'thas's attack, one of his lieutenants, Spellreaver Marathelle, looted it and took it to Sunfury Hold northeast of the tower. No doubt she thought it a pretty little bauble."
2234,"Escape from the Staging Grounds : Thank K'aresh! He would have torn me apart!I'm a Protectorate soldier, fleshling. My platoon was sent on a recon mission about 10 days ago. As we were moving across the upper ledges of this island, a group of Ethereum jumped us. At least I think it was Ethereum. They had the same energy color but their wrappings looked void.Only Tyralius was spared. I think they put him in a prison cell.I've got to get back to the Protectorate Watch Post! Can you escort me back?"
2235,"Vessels of Power : Amid the ruins of Tuurem are a number of vessels containing raw, magical energy. We are fortunate that the Broken who have overrun the city are ignorant to the resource in their midst, but we cannot assume they will remain so forever.With those vessels and their power in hand, the scattered survivors of my people can resist the lure of demonic magic. Every quel'dorei we can save from our prince's folly is one more that can help us regain our lost glory. Bring me these vessels, <class>."
2236,"Spirits of the Feralfen : The most powerful tribe of Lost Ones in the marsh, the Feralfen, are said to possess powerful medicine. There may be no truth to such rumors, but anything that might help me channel the spirits of this world cannot be ignored.Find the Feralfen mystics, hunters and druids, <name>, and capture their totems. Everything I need to know should be apparent from the carvings."
2237,"Firewing Signets : It is no secret that Kael'thas Sunstrider perceives us as a great threat.  Let's face it - not many sin'dorei, fresh from Silvermoon, are willing to join the sort of company that Kael keeps.It's also no secret that this is not just a war of words.  Scryers and the armies that serve Kael'thas attack each other on sight.  The only way to prove you're with us, <name>, is to do your share of fighting.Kael's lower ranking followers wear Firewing signets to indicate their rank.  Bring them to me."
2238,"Thunderlord Clan Artifacts : The artifact bears markings that indicate its origins as being created by the Thunderlord clan orcs.  These orcs used to live at Thunderlord Stronghold before they were changed into fel orcs.For a time the Bladespire ogres inhabited the stronghold until recently when the Horde pushed them out.You've heard of other artifacts that were lost.  A drum, an arrow and a tablet come to mind as objects that you know are being sought after.Find them in Bladespire Hold and return them to Rokgar Bloodgrip."
2239,"Disrupt Their Reinforcements : You'll find the Legion front to our northeast, and spaced along it are portals used to gather reinforcements from throughout Outland. We, <name>, are going to destroy those portals!Take this primer.  Designed in Area 52, it uses the demons' own power as an explosive device!  Defeat Legion forces around Portals Grimh and Kaalez to gather demonic rune stones, use the primer to detonate the stones inside the portals... then watch the fireworks!!Go, <name>, and return to me when your mission is complete."
2240,"The Cleansing Must Be Stopped : Our scouts captured a draenei paladin at the Pools of Aggonar.  He was to take part in a cleansing ritual to purify the pools.  We must stop the draenei from succeeding or we will lose our supply of felblood!He was carrying this signaling gem, looking to mark a spot where a priest - or ""anchorite"" as they call themselves - could perform their rituals in safety.  Place the gem near the Altar of Aggonar and be ready to ambush any approaching draenei.I suggest that you take a friend or two along."
2241,"A Haunted History : Have you felt the cold chill? Perhaps what you thought was a hand on your shoulder? That was not your mind playing tricks on you, <race>. The land is haunted. Ghosts litter the landscape, stuck here for all eternity.Would you like to see them? Are you sure about that? These types of things tend to change a person - and not for the better.Very well, I will need you to collect for me the ever-burning ash that is found near any of the fel lava pools of western Shadowmoon. Anywhere near green lava..."
2242,"Investigate Tuurem : You know, come to think of it, I do recall selling several boxes of strange and exotic engineering parts to Empoor about a month ago.  I'm not sure what they'd be used for, but I know that they were delivered to Tuurem.Perhaps one or more of those boxes is still there?"
2243,"Ar'tor, Son of Oronok : My youngest son, Ar'tor, left to search Illidari Point - far to the southwest, nestled between Legion Hold and Wildhammer Stronghold.While Ar'tor is a hunter of remarkable skill and an expert tracker, I fear that he may be in over his head this time. Illidari Point is the proving grounds for Illidan's demons. These are demons that left the Burning Legion to join the Betrayer!Travel to Illidari Point and find Ar'tor, <name>."
2244,"The Fate of Flanis : Wing Commander Nuainn originally sent three of us out here to keep watch over the Deathforge and to gather information. Flanis Swiftwing volunteered to try to infiltrate the Deathforge, but we haven't heard anything from him in days.I fear the worst, <name>. Flanis is a skilled scout, but if he's gotten in over his head, we have no way of knowing. Search the Deathforge for him and recover any information or items he might have collected."
2245,"To Legion Hold : The fortress of Legion Hold is nigh impregnable, and to be completely honest, I can't spare the forces for an assault. Our hopes are riding on you, <name>.What little information we've been able to gather indicates that the Legion stocks and prepares its infernals at the hold. With the help of a disguise I'll give you, you must sneak into Legion Hold and learn about the their plans. Your best hope is to intercept or overhear communication between their commanders. Good luck, <name>."
2246,"Maintaining the Sunwell Portal : We must maintain the energy to our portal or it will collapse. The mana cells that the ethereals at Bash'ir Landing have hidden will continue to serve our purposes. The landing sits atop the northwestern corner of the Blade's Edge Mountains, far to the north.Remember, acquire a phase device from one of the ethereals and then use it to locate the smuggled goods.Just be cautious of the phase wyrms that they use to guard the mana cells."
2247,
2248,
2249,"Getting the Bladespire Tanked : I'll not take another sip of that ill-smelling muck!  But it does give me an idea.<Borgrim gets a twinkle in his eye.>So here's the plan.  We know that the Bloodmaul practically live off of this swill.  But I wonder what their enemies, the Bladespire ogres, think of it?<name>, I want you to take the rest of this rubbish and see if you can get the Bladespire ogres tanked.  You can find them by heading north from Bloodmaul Outpost through the ravine."
2250,"The Fel and the Furious : <Nakansi leafs through the manual.>All the information is here, but be warned. These things weren't built to be controlled remotely.We can modify one for you to use for a short time, but you'll have to work fast, or there's no telling what might happen! I wouldn't be surprised if your little stunt with the fel reaver catches the attention of the Legion scum, either. Try to keep yourself safe, but remember, the mission and the safety of Shadowmoon Village come first!"
2251,"Wrangle Some Aether Rays! : Wanna help the Skyguard and Ogri'la?Just hear me out before you walk away, <hot stuff/girly>.  We're in need of remounts!  The bombing runs and missions to Bash'ir Landing have taken a toll on our mounts.The aether rays that fly around Vortex Pinnacle, and the Crystal Spine to the northeast, look like they'd do just fine.  You don't even have to bring them back here, though that would be nice.  Just break and rope them, and we'll track them down later.Think you can wrangle me up some?"
2252,"You're Hired! : Let me be the first to welcome you aboard, Junior Technician 3rd Grade <name>!We're building my masterpiece out here - the X-52 Nether-Rocket!But first we need to get all of the parts and fuel for it.  That's where you come in.To start, I need crystals - LOTS of crystals - for the rocket's Etherlithium Engine Matrix.  The draenei had crystals coming out of their ears!So head north to the Ruins of Enkaat and get them for me!  Nevermind all of the draenei ghosts."
2253,"Recipe for Destruction : Atop Manaforge Ultris lies the tear in the nether that the void lord, Dimensius, came through. That tear provides Dimensius with a link to the void, rendering him immune to physical harm. If we can get a lock on the conduit that Dimensius is using to keep himself phased out of this plane of existence, we can destroy it and then destroy Dimensius.To do this, we're going to first need you to collect fragments of Dimensius from the void creatures that he sends out to do his dirty work."
2254,"Birds of a Feather : I have seen many ebon wings in the Maw, but never brilliant golden ones.  Now that the aural sequencers are relaying information reliably, we should discover the source of these feathers.  Follow the trail, Maw Walker. There is a mystery here... and very likely profit.  Gold has value where you come from, does it not?"
2255,"Strange Brew : If I'm going to start this vacation out right, then I'm going to need more brew.  Unfortunately, the elves know nothing of the fine art of fermentation.I overheard that the Bloodmaul ogres down in the ravine have plenty.  I'm willing to give it a try.Do me a favor?  Head south through the Living Grove and then down the ramp to the east into Bloodmaul Outpost and procure me some?  I hear they have big barrels of it laying around and that their brewmasters carry it around to all the other ogres."
2256,"A Fel Whip For Gahk : Gahk think being smart is dumb sometimes.  Gahk not want to think.  Me want little <race> to smash big demons!Dey have some chiefs, and da chiefs all have whips to hurt da little demons.  You bring Gahk a whip!You challenge demon chief in forge camps at burning, green, fel crystal prism.  Use many apexis shards to get dem to come.  Dey called Galvanoth, Braxxus, Zarcsin and da Mo'arg Incinerator."
2257,"He Called Himself Altruis... : A being riding atop a nether drake arrived in town late last week. He introduced himself as Altruis and then proceeded to ask us several questions about Nagrand.He claimed that he was hunting Legion. That such insanity was actually his job. Can you imagine? A person that would willingly hunt demons?Before he left, he asked that we let the would-be heroes in town know that he will be staying in western Nagrand for awhile and that should they seek a purpose, to find him."
2258,"To the Stormspire : Master Engineer Ghabar will want to know about the results of the diagnostics. If anything, they caution us to keep a close eye on the workings of our dome generators. As the fields become more and more unstable, their effects will become harder to control. It could spell disaster for our expedition and anything else housed within the domes.You'll find Ghabar at the Stormspire. Just follow the road north from this eco-dome and across the bridge. It'll lead you to the elevator at the base of the spire."
2259,"Cleansing the Waters : I must ask that you finish what we've set in motion.  Now that the demonic influence has weakened you must take this cleansing vial and pour it at the very source of the taint - Aggonar's own corpse.You will find the demon's bones at the northern end of the pools.  Beware, I sense that Aggonar's essence has not quite left this world."
2260,"Invasion Point: Annihilator : Well, we've located the Legion's final base on the ridge - Invasion Point: Annihilator. It lies northwest of Forge Camp: Rage - and it houses a warp-portal through which the Legion has been drawing its reinforcements! You've got to close that portal to prevent any more demons from coming through. The Point's overlord, Warbringer Arix'Amal, holds the portal's activation key. Take it from him and shut that blasted gateway down!"
2261,
2262,"An Ambitious Plan : The blood elves epitomize the irresponsible use of magic, <class>. They do not control magical energy. Rather, they are slaves to it and will suffer nothing to stand between them and their addiction. They consume the energies of Outland's voidwalkers to power their demonic magics.I've prepared a crystal charged with a spell that will allow us to neutralize a voidwalker and sever its link to this world when destroyed. I've mostly seen the voidwalkers in the Warp Fields to the southeast of Hellfire Citadel."
2263,"Eradicate the Burning Legion : Though this land is full of strange new enemies, the Burning Legion is still the greatest threat to our Expedition. One of my most trusted warriors, Sergeant Shatterskull, has been studying the Legion's tactics - trying to discern the demons' true purpose in this land. Seek him out at the supply caravan just outside the southern wall.And <name> - be wary of the Legion. Their evil cannot be underestimated."
2264,"Torching Sunfury Hold : Ridding Sunfury Hold of its garrison is not sufficient to keep the blood elves from reoccupying it. Kael'thas's followers are zealous and tenacious. Leaving them anything to use at Sunfury is effectively an invitation to return.No, it must all be destroyed. See to it that their tents and artillery burn to ashes!<The ghost's fists clench.>Steal torches from the Sunfury flamekeepers to accomplish your task, <name>."
2265,"Strange Energy : Something strange has changed the teromoths of the thicket.Where once there was a diversity of life in there, now only the teromoths remain.  And while before they were at peace, now they are agitated and will not hesitate to attack you should you get close.I need to compare the vicious ones to the normal.  Collect for me a number of samples from both.  You'll find the unaffected teromoths both to the south and the north.I'm certain this is related to whatever killed all of the druids."
2266,"Seek Out Ameer : It would seem that an outside force has taken an interest in the business practices of the Consortium. Five Consortium dealers have gone missing in the past two days. We have reason to believe the Ethereum are involved. If you are interested in assisting, seek out Commander Ameer at the Protectorate Watch Post.You will find the Protectorate Watch Post directly east of here on the next island."
2267,"Investigate the Crash : When I was wounded in the wastes I saw a goblin zeppelin crash.  It went down to the northwest, beyond the Expedition Armory. The zeppelin was on fire.  Shrieking, burning goblins were falling like bombs from the sky.  Of course I was in a lot of pain and I had lost a lot of blood.  I may have imagined the whole thing.If you can find any survivors, we can offer them sanctuary here at Spinebreaker Post."
2268,"Asghar's Totem : What you read in the commander's journal is true. While the orcish Horde massed under Gul'dan, my people sought to defend ourselves from the threat by striking against him. Gul'dan learned of their intentions and cast a mighty spell that destroyed our camps and twisted the spirits of my brothers.They must be stopped before they unleash a greater evil. In the Sketh'lon Wreckage to the north, seek out Asghar and bring me the totem he carries. With it, we can begin to thwart the dark conclave's plans."
2269,"A Convincing Disguise : Infiltrating the ranks of Kael's army will not be an easy task.  With my knowledge of illusionary magic I could pass you off as one of Kael's followers, but there are certain details in their uniforms I could not replicate.Bring me a set of their robes, a pair of their gloves and a Sunfury guardsman medallion.  This will make the results of my magic much more convincing."
2270,"Pick Your Part : Those ethereal clowns are as opportunistic as us, I'll give them that.  But no one, and I mean NO ONE, moves in on a B.O.O.M. claim!The Heap to the south is ours!If we're to finish the X-52 Nether-Rocket, we're going to need all of the new tech that we can get our hands on.  And since the ethereals are stealing from us, I think it's only fair that we repay them in kind.Why don't you head down there and see if you can acquire some of their technology out from under their noses!"
2271,"WANTED: Giselda the Crone : Wanted: Dead or AliveGiselda the Crone of Kil'sorrow and her lackeys for murder, ritual sacrifice, communing with the Legion, kidnapping, and burglary.Known to congregate at Kil'sorrow Fortress in southeastern Nagrand, near the border of Terokkar.Large gold reward to be dispensed by Warden Moi'bff Jill at Telaar to anyone able to bring Giselda to justice."
2272,"WANTED: Zorbo the Advisor : Wanted: Dead or AliveZorbo the Advisor, wanted for numerous planned attacks on Telaar. Along with his reavers and shaman, Zorbo has slain countless Broken. Consider Zorbo as armed, dangerous, and merciless.Zorbo makes his home in the Laughing Skull Ruins in the northern mountains of Nagrand.Reward for Zorbo the Advisor's death or capture to be dispensed by Warden Moi'bff Jill at Telaar."
2273,
2274,"Proving Your Strength : Though we seek a peaceful life, our enemies are many.  Of these, none match the ogres in sheer brute power.If you seek to prove your prowess to us, bring me the warbeads they wear around their necks.  I will tell others of your accomplishments."
2275,"Jyoba's Report : Flecks of withered fungus dot the body of Scout Jyoba. Whatever killed him must've been made of the same dying fungus as the giant wilting mushrooms of the Dead Mire. Perhaps one of the withered giants caught him by surprise as he sat writing his report.Without the text of the report, it's nearly impossible to tell what the scout discovered. If the report can be found, it should be returned to Zurai."
2276,"Demonic Contamination : Welcome to the Cenarion Post, <class>. We don't often get company out here, but I'm grateful for the visit. My work with the creatures of this desolate land requires me to travel to many remote places.The Cenarion Expedition has dispatched me to study some of the most dangerous wildlife in Outland, and I've made a startling discovery. While many creatures here have already undergone radical changes, they continue to mutate. I'm collecting blood samples to document the changes, and any help would be welcome."
2277,"The Eyes of Skettis : Doom harkens from the cliffs of Skettis.My people, the arakkoa, face a fate shrouded in unspeakable evil. Too often have we abused dark magic for wrongdoing. Through A'dal I have learned of the Light and of redemption.Terokk watches his colonies from Skettis through orbs enchanted by the black art. Steal these Eyes from Veil Reskk and Veil Shienor in northern Terokkar. Let me see what Terokk sees. Let me look through the eyes of Skettis."
2278,Synthesis of Power : Arcane tomes are not ordinary books that happen to deal with arcane matters.  There is intrinsic power in them - a power I've learned to synthesize into a single arcane rune.Should you find an arcane tome in your travels I will give you one such rune.  Only the most powerful wielders of magic carry the books I need.  In Outland this usually means Kael's blood elves - but you'd be surprised by where such tomes often turn up.
2279,"The Summoning Chamber : In order for the Shadow Council to construct infernals as quickly as they're being used, they must have an area dedicated to summoning the corrupted elementals that serve as the souls of the creatures.The summoning chamber is likely to be found below ground, near a pool of fouled water or lava. Locate the summoning chamber within the Deathforge and find a way to end their summoning ritual. The mo'arg involved in making the infernals may carry a tool that will help disrupt the summoner's magics."
2280,"Ogre Heaven : Now that you have delivered us from bondage, we can begin the process of reunifying the clans.  This will take some time; old grudges are difficult to overcome.But more pressing, you must go to Ogri'la in the heavens above to the west.  You must defend it, and us, from those forces above that the gronn used to protect us from: ethereals, demons, and worst of all, the black dragonflight.When you find ogre heaven, seek out the wisdom of Chu'a'lor on how best to proceed."
2281,"Damning Evidence : As you may have noticed, there are servants of the Burning Legion all over Manaforge Ara.  Kael'thas has entered an alliance with the Burning Legion.  He must've caught wind of Illidan's descent into insanity and switched paymasters accordingly.If the Scryers get definite proof of this, it will give them a considerable political advantage.  I know for a fact that the Legion forces at this manaforge have orders that bear Kael's seal.Get these orders and bring them to Thalodien."
2282,"Ride the Lightning : We haven't kept the use of the Zephyrium Capacitorium under budget.  But, it occurs to me that the serpents of the Scalewing Shelf to the east have a lightning breath and glands that we can make use of.I've repolarized the magneto collector to absorb lightning strikes and I want you to head up there, activate it on yourself, and get us some cheap fuel from those serpents."
2283,"Stopping the Spread : I have just gotten word of a catastrophe of epic proportions, <name>. The foul Murkblood have sacked the orc village of Sunspring Post, northwest of here, and murdered its residents. To make matters worse, they have begun dumping the bodies into Sunspring Lake. Should those bodies rot, our primary source of water in the region will be compromised.It's a gruesome task that I give you next but it must be done. Take this enchanted torch and return to Sunspring. Burn all of the rotting orc corpses..."
2284,"Manaforge B'naar : You may have noticed one of Kael's manaforges on your way here.  You know, the large purple buildings sucking energy from the sky?We were sent here by the Sha'tar to investigate them.  You can help our information gathering efforts by obtaining a personnel roster.  Giving us an idea of who's there and what they do will prove to be invaluable information.We believe Captain Arathyn, leading a ballista team just outside of Manaforge B'naar, is in possession of one such roster.  Obtain it for us."
2285,"Help Mama Wheeler : Say, <name>, I was wondering if you could do me another favor.My partner out in the field could probably use a hand.  I was wondering if you could go check in on her.I'm sure that Mama Wheeler will appreciate the help.  Just don't mind her sharp tongue.She's trying to look out for our interests to the east.  You'll find her just inside Eco-Dome Midrealm at the Midrealm Post."
2286,"Arelion's Journal : My husband, Arelion, had been fascinated with the Pools of Aggonar ever since we arrived in Outland.  He spent much of his time studying slimes, of all things!He went missing in there a few days ago.  They say he's dead and there's nothing I can do about it.One thing I can do is try to ensure that his research doesn't die with him.  Go northeast to the pools and look for his journal.  He always carried it inside a brown knapsack."
2287,A Spirit Ally? : We must find out how much power this Feralfen snake spirit possesses and whether it can be bent to our will. Imagine what I could do with the powers of an Outland spirit at my command!Take this totem with you and make your way to the foot of the stairs leading to the Boha'mu Ruins. Plant the totem in the ground and it should do the rest. The spirit should not be able to tell who has used the totem until it has manifested.
2288,"Grillok ""Darkeye"" : Grillok Darkeye has wagered a piece of himself to dark powers, and gained great magic for it.  His lost eye burns deep in some hellish pit, now a demon's trinket... and the patch that covers his betrayal holds its own dark secrets.Bring me Grillok's eyepatch, <name>, and I will reward you greatly for your service..."
2289,"A Ghost in the Machine : I fear that these dwarves do not understand what they have built upon. This area was once the ancestral grounds for the Shadowmoon orcs. I speak of spirits, <race>.For nearly twenty years they have laid dormant beneath the Wildhammer Stronghold, but recently, something has riled them up.Venture beyond the gates of Wildhammer and seek out the pools and rivers of fel lava found across this land. Near the lava will be ever-burning ash. Bring me this ash so that I may craft something that will help us."
2290,"Safeguarding the Watchers : In your travels, you might have encountered some of the expedition's watchers. They do the majority of the field work: documenting the unique inhabitants of the marsh, collecting samples, and making contact with sentient species.The safety of the watchers is paramount, <class>. We've had to recall the watchers we sent to explore Funggor Cavern to the south, because of marshbeast attacks. Warden Hamoot believes that killing their leader, Lord Klaq, will bring a swift end to the attacks."
2291,"A Job Undone : Someone needs to find a way to make Reavij come to his senses! He's ignoring his duty and instead, he's devoting all his energy to getting my attention. I've tried ignoring him and telling him to stop. Nothing seems to work.Until he gets over this, I'm left cleaning up after him. He was supposed to have dealt with Sporewing, but I'll bet the monster is alive and well. If you have time, would you mind going to the western part of the Dead Mire and killing the bat? I'll deal with Reavij in the meantime."
2292,Scratches : The pictograms indicate using feathers to cast the spell at one of the circles of power in Veil Lashh.Confusing iconography seems to show an arakkoa being suffused with the spirit of a kaliri.
2293,"The Shadowmoon Shuffle : <Borak looks you up and down.>This is going to be tricky, but I think I can make it work.I can disguise you as one of these Illidari blood elves, <name>. What I need first, though, are several pieces of their armor. It is imperative that the armor be clean. No blood stains! We want to avoid suspicion.Bring me the gear and I'll take care of the rest of the disguise.Once the disguise is assembled, you're going to deliver the message to the Grand Commander - in person."
2294,"Digging Through Bones : Oy! You look like you can take care of yerself, <race>. Me and the crew here are looking for a bodyguard to watch over us while we hit a dig site to the north. The pay is pretty good and all you gotta do is make sure no nasty creatures kill me or any of my employees.If you successfully make it back without any casualties, Dwarfowitz over there will pay ya."
2295,"Poaching from Poachers : Pardon me, but I couldn't help but overhear your conversation with Chawn.  I'd like to help.I'm studying the Blackwing Coven, and helping the druids in their dealings with them.I am very interested in acquiring a few of their dragon whelps; it would help us to gauge exactly what we're up against by understanding that which they revere.But first, we're going to need to acquire some nets.  I noticed that the wyrmcult poachers out in the Ruuan Weald have an abundance of them."
2296,"The Sharpest Blades : The damp atmosphere of the marsh has taken a toll on my metal tools. It's made woodworking a lot more difficult than it ought to be, so I've given up on metal blades.It turns out that the marshfang slicers living to the south and west of town grow blades that are sharper than any steel I've ever owned. They're also resistant to rust and wear. It's just a little tricky to attach them to a handle, but I think I've got it figured out. I'd appreciate any blades you could bring me."
2297,Missing Friends : We broke down here because some guys came in the night and made a lot of noise.  It was scary.  I don't know when we are going to get moving again.  Some of my friends are missing though.  I don't know where they are.  I think those scary bird men took them away to the northwest.  They probably are all locked up in cages and stuff.  If you find them that would be great.  I'm kind of worried about them.
2298,"Fumping : How would you like to do a little more work for the Explorers' League? These bone worms have us all quite intrigued.I've got a drum right here that you can use out in the Bone Wastes. Just bang on the damned thing and see what you get. If it's a worm, kill it and bring back the carcass for us to study. We'll need a good lot of carcasses to get a valid testing sample."
2299,The Pools of Aggonar : Much has changed since the days when we called this land Draenor.  Parts of the land have been forever changed by the demons' taint.One such place is known as the Pools of Aggonar.  It was once the location of our people's sacred springs.  The blood of the demon Aggonar fouled the very essence of the holy waters.  This fel blood has spawned foul beings that must be cleansed if we're ever to reclaim the pools.  Travel east of here and slay the Terrorfiends and slimes that wander the pools.
2300,"Cursed Talismans : <name>, we cannot allow the Bleeding Hollow orcs to possess their cursed talismans!  You must acquire them for us so they may be disposed of, and so the soldiers who owned them may be honored for their sacrifices.Go to Zeth'Gor, the cursed abode of the Bleeding Hollow, and perform your grim task... return to me when you have collected the talismans."
2301,"Hotter than Hell : It's not working, <lad/lass>.  I cannot give it enough heat... the materials will not be properly tempered.You know, the Fel Reavers used by the Burning Legion are powered by a scalding core of fel fire - it burns much hotter than normal fire.If you could find enough people to take one down, you could heat the mold in the insides of the fallen reaver.  Beware, <class>, those fel reavers pack quite a punch."
2302,"The Annals of Kirin'Var : Silencing the spirits has not bled them of their aggression as we had hoped it would. The malevolent spirits you subdued have reemerged in the streets of the town.We must uncover what is causing this to happen. The destruction of Kirin'Var was just the beginning, or else the spirits would have been quieted by now.The town hall in the southern section of Kirin'Var maintained a logbook of all the residents. Last I heard, it was in the keeping of Battle-Mage Dathric. Perhaps his spirit still has it."
2303,"Kick Them While They're Down : The news you've discovered is fortunate, <name>.  Not only do you get to waltz into Manaforge Duro unfettered, this also presents a great opportunity to deal a blow to Kael's army.Use the mana creature assault to your advantage and pick off any Sunfury stragglers you run into.I do not take particular glee in the senseless slaughter of my own kin the way that Thalodien does, but the tactical advantage here is too high to pass up."
2304,"Natural Enemies : Us sporelings and the bog lords have never gotten along well.  In the past, we've managed to keep them at bay with spears and stones.  Lately they seem to have become more aggressive... or more desperate.  They do not fear us or our weapons.You are much scarier and better armed than us.  If you were to fight the boglords for us, we'd be forever in your debt!  Bring me their tendrils so I know how many you've killed."
2305,"Ishanah's Help : The time has come to face Socrethar, <name>.  Confronting an eredar leader isn't something that's taken lightly among us.  A single mistake is likely to cost us our lives if we're ill-prepared.Take Socrethar's teleportation stone to High Priestess Ishanah at the Shrine of Unending Light in Shattrath City.  She will determine how we need to handle the situation."
2306,"Missing Missive : Upon examining the battered leather case, it becomes apparent that the container's damage must've been caused by the caustic fluid of the worm's digestive tract. The leather appears to have been intricately tooled at one time, but the details of its adornment can no longer be made out.The only recognizable feature of the case is a worn logo of the Cenarion Circle. Knowing nothing about the contents of the case, you decide the best course of action would be to deliver it to a Circle member."
2307,Talbuk Mastery : I don't think that I'm up to the hunt today.  Do you think that you might take my place?I told Hemet that I was going to see about bagging us some of those talbuk that seem to be all over the place.  The stags are especially nice to hunt.  You can find them congregated around the nearby trees.Think that you could take care of that for me?
2308,"Dragonmaw Race: Wing Commander Ichman : Three years I spent in that hell hole. Three years a prisoner of war to the damnable Frostwolf Clan. Made to sit in their tower and listen to them endlessly whine about the bridge to Dun Baldar. About how it's ""unfair"" that blah, blah, blah, blah... War isn't fair! To hell with 'em all!The minute I was freed I left that place forever and came here to start a new life. Now Mulv and I are vying for the top orc spot. If you want it, you're gonna have to go through me, scrub.We go when you're ready."
2309,"Capturing the Phylactery : I suppose an explanation is in order. You've met one of the archmage's apprentices, Ravandwyr, but there was also another named Naberius.He was an ardent student, but was drawn to necromancy. When Kael'thas appeared with his forces, Naberius seized the opportunity to betray the archmage, handing over the secrets to the tower's defense.Now, it seems, he has become a lich. If we are to stop him, we must capture his phylactery. Knowing him, he would've buried it somewhere out of sight in his domain."
2310,"Against the Illidari : I still have respect for Illidan.  Without him I would not have found my path.He is not who he once was, however.  His soul has been corrupted by power, his mind has been twisted by defeat.  He has become what I am sworn to destroy and his pet servants, the Illidari, are as much of an abomination as any demon of the Burning Legion.His grasp on Outland is slipping yet his reach is still vast.  Prove you're not with him by slaying his lieutenant Lothros at Illidari Point in Shadowmoon Valley."
2311,"The Ethereum : Directly south of here you will find the Ethereum Staging Grounds. The Ethereum are there, preparing for something... Perhaps an assault on Ultris.We can't take any chances, though, <class>. Break through their perimeter defenses and take out their training facility.Once you've destroyed their soldiers and Captain Zovax, locate Ethereum transponder Zeta and use it to establish contact with me to get your next set of orders."
2312,"Stymying the Arakkoa : We need to show the arakkoa that they cannot attack our people with impunity. If we don't stop them here, the roads will no longer be safe for our merchants, couriers, or soldiers.My scouts have identified the leaders of each of the major arakkoa settlements in the area. Seek out Ashkaz, Ayit, and Urdak, in Veil Reskk, Veil Shienor, and Veil Skith and kill them."
2313,"Messenger to the Feralfen : The time has come for us to embrace the Feralfen and teach them that the Light has not forsaken them. Take the potion I've prepared and carry it with you to the Boha'mu Ruins.Once you arrive at the ruins, drink the potion to assume the form of one of their bird spirits. Speak with Elder Kuruti and let him know the draenei are ready to welcome his people as our long lost brothers."
2314,"Ango'rosh Encroachment : The small band of Broken you see here is a mission from a larger settlement in Nagrand. The Kurenai, as we call ourselves, are Broken who desire to reunite with our draenei brothers.My group has come here to strengthen Kurenai ties to the draenei of Telredor.If the Ango'rosh ogres have their way, this temple will not stand much longer. They have cleared the Hewn Bog of its towering mushrooms and draw ever closer to our refuge. If you would call yourself our friend, aid us in fighting this enemy."
2315,"Speak with Rilak the Redeemed : You look surprised to be talking to me. I do not blame you. My people, the arakkoa, deserve to be feared.Speak with Rilak the Redeemed in Shattrath City if you wish to know more. He can be found in the northern part of the Lower City, with the other outcasts of Skettis.And, <name>, we will speak again."
2316,"Solving the Problem : The appearance of the Murkblood in Nagrand has had a profound negative impact on our environment. The elementals are all in flux which has, in turn, greatly disturbed the wildlife. Worse yet, the razing of Sunspring Post has reignited the hatred that the orcs held for our people.While the Kurenai are a different tribe than the Murkblood, all an orc sees is Broken.We must make an effort to solve this dilemma. Travel to Sunspring Post, northwest of here, and resolve the Murkblood problem."
2317,
2318,"The Nesingwary Safari : These orcs have never seen a tauren before - if you can believe such a thing. If it weren't for Captain Kroghan, they would have probably been serving me for their next meal right about now.But where are my manners? I am Ohlorn Farstrider, hunter extraordinaire! I am part of the Nesingwary expedition that came up here from Azeroth in search of big game. If you are interested in the hunt, perhaps you should visit my crew at the Nesingwary Safari, due east of here near the border of Zangarmarsh."
2319,"Natural Armor : Maktu can always see a draenei approaching in his shiny armor from a mile away, even in this murky swamp!Maktu wants to laugh at them, but then he remembers that they have been kind to the Kurenai and he wants to teach them about how Kurenai make armor.The dark, scaly hides of the fenclaw thrashers make some of the best armor Maktu has ever worn. If <name> can bring Maktu some of these hides from the fenclaw thrashers deep in Serpent Lake, he'll be happy to share some of his armor."
2320,"The Terror of Marshlight Lake : Traveling through naga-infested lands has shown me the cruel truth about how my less fortunate brethren are treated. At Marshlight Lake, to the southwest, I observed a particularly malicious taskmaster playing a deadly game. He orders his slaves out to the islands in Marshlight Lake when he knows that Terrorclaw, a giant bogstrok, is ready to feed.I needn't describe what results. We are too few to take on the naga directly, but we can deprive them of their amusement by killing their pet."
2321,
2322,"Kroghan's Report : My original orders were to remain in Garadar for a short time, then continue on and report to Blood Guard Gulmok at Shadowmoon Village. What I've seen in my time here is that Garadar could benefit from a long term Horde liaison.I know that Blood Guard Gulmok needs all the troops he can get, but I know he'll understand that my mission here isn't yet complete. Travel to Shadowmoon Village, in northwestern Shadowmoon Valley, and inform Blood Guard Gulmok of my delayed arrival."
2323,"Speak with Scout Neftis : I am informed that one of our scouts near Grangol'var Village is currently observing a shadowy band that has recently moved in there.<name>, I want you to speak with Scout Neftis and see how you can assist her in figuring out what this unknown group is up to.Just head south out of here, and then due west, skirting the north of the Bone Wastes.  Her last report puts her position near the southern entrance to the village."
2324,"Seek Out Kirrik : Other arakkoa took part in the betrayal of Terokk.Kirrik recognized Terokk as a charlatan, not a prophet. The only prophecy Terokk envisioned was the doom borne of his own bidding.It was Kirrik who led us bravely from Skettis. After our pilgrimage to Shattrath, Kirrik traveled to the colonies in search of others.This missive tells of what the Eyes have seen. Kirrik must be told! Follow the road south out of Shattrath to the Bone Wastes and look for the caravan."
2325,"A Curse Upon Both of Your Clans! : T'chali wants revenge on all of the ogres!T'chali was a powerful witch doctor in life.  If you reach into me grave you will find a wicked strong fetish.Invoke the fetish's magic at the entrances to the buildings and towers of both Bladespire Hold and Bloodmaul Outpost.  The voodoo you work will summon an evil spirit that you must defeat.  This in turn will curse that building.Beware, if you attempt to curse a building that is already cursed, you will call down another cursed spirit!"
2326,"Kill Them All! : Commander <name>, stand at attention! You are to take a battalion of Skybreakers and sack the Scryers' outpost located at the foot of the Netherwing Fields. With the Sanctum of the Stars destroyed, our lines of communication to our posts at Eclipse Point and Illidari Point will once more be open.Go now! Use this flare gun to signal the Skybreakers for the attack!"
2327,"The Boha'mu Ruins : Before my people were decimated by the orcs, Telredor served as a retreat for draenei anchorites and spiritualists. A small order of anchorites and vindicators maintained a number of shrines in this region.During the war, we lost contact with the anchorites assigned to the shrines, particularly the Boha'mu temple to the southwest. I've heard reports that a tribe of Lost Ones has settled in the area and may even be using the ruins. Visit the Boha'mu Ruins and tell me of what you find there."
2328,"Trapping the Light Fantastic : The Razaani ethereals have been playing with some interesting technology at Razaan's Landing to the north.I'm sure they won't mind if you use this trap to take a few samples of their little pink floating light orbs?  They're probably only for decoration anyway.The trap has a special property to it that when opened should attract one of the floating balls towards it.  Of course, it'll probably also alert the Razaani to your presence."
2329,"Gather the Orbs : The Razaani ethereals have strange devices that emit small, pink floating light orbs.  They remind me of souls.They are not to be confused with the large yellow balls that break free of the ethereal when they die, these are something else entirely.I'd like for you to head north to Razaan's Landing and drop some totems, which will attact the pink light orbs.Bring them back to me so that I might determine exactly what they are."
2330,"Source of the Corruption : There was something wrong with those three, they had a fel taint about them that was... unsettling. I believe they were somehow woken later than the other risen. Curse the Legion and their meddling!  The reinforcements are streaming out of Black Rook Hold from Heroes' Rest. We must make our way there and see if we can stop the source of these new troops."
2331,"A Cure for Zahlia : The woman to my right suffered a severe injury to the head.  She survived, but lost her eyesight.A traditional cure used among my people requires the blood of a very old basilisk.Unfortunately, due to poaching from various groups, Terokkar basilisks don't tend to live very long.There is one basilisk whose name I've known since I was a youngling.  It is known only as ""Stonegazer"" and it's rumored to live east of here, near the land's edge.Bring me its blood so that Zahlia may see once again."
2332,"Boiling Blood : That last experiment was not a complete loss -- I did save a small bit of the blood you brought me.  Now boiled down, it should be free of whatever curses the Bleeding Hollow witches placed on their people's blood.I need more for study.  Go gather Bleeding Hollow blood from the orcs in Zeth'Gor.  When you've gathered the blood, bring it to their cursed cauldron and boil it.  Bring me the boiled blood."
2333,"The Art of Fel Reaver Maintenance : The best way to destroy the rest of the Legion's supplies is to use their own weapons against them. I've been working on a rig that will let you take control of one of those Fel Reaver Sentinels below.There are a couple things I need to work out, yet. For that, I'll need the manual that Doctor Gutrick keeps locked in a chest at the bottom of the ramp. He probably won't give up the key without a fight, so you'll need to capture it. Bring the fel reaver manual back to me and I'll do the rest!"
2334,"Spectrecles : I call them ""Spectrecles."" Clever, no? When you equip these goggles, you will be able to see the spirits of Shadowmoon Valley.Before I let you have them, though, you must promise me that you will help us clear out the ghosts at the village.Take the goggles and destroy any and all spirits that you see wandering about Shadowmoon Village. Hopefully, destroying these spirits will force any that remain to move elsewhere."
2335,"Reclaiming Holy Grounds : You did well against the Broken in Baa'ri, <name>.  Let's see how well you do against Illidan's most feared army.The fel orcs of the Shadowmoon Clan occupy the Ata'mal Terrace, once a very holy site where ata'mal crystals were used in spiritual ceremonies.We had reason to believe they were hiding an actual ata'mal crystal in the vicinity, but our scrying has revealed nothing.  Nevertheless, the fel orcs are on draenei holy ground and their presence must be dealt with."
2336,Armaments for Deception : You will need to steal Kil'sorrow armaments from Kil'sorrow Fortress if my plan is to work.Search the fortress for crates of Kil'sorrow armaments. Bring whatever you can find to me.Kil'sorrow Fortress is located directly south and a little to the west of the Burning Blade Ruins.
2337,"The Master Planner : All forge camps have a master planner. The master planner dictates what types of structures are present at a forge camp and how each structure is situated. Moreover, this information is kept on a set of blueprints that the planner carries around on their person.We need the master planner's blueprints. Armed with such exacting information, we could persuade an acquaintance of mine to lend some assistance.Find the mo'arg master planner and take his blueprints. He will be stationed behind the forges."
2338,
2339,"Shutting Down Manaforge Ara : One manaforge is all that keeps Tempest Keep functional.  After we bring Manaforge Ara down, Kael will have to resort to depleting whatever energy he's got stored up.Travel to Manaforge Ara, in the northwest, and deliver the final blow that we need by shutting it down.The last access crystal is in the possession of Overseer Azarad.  Be warned that we expect heavy opposition in the last of Kael's functional manaforges.  You're likely to need the assistance of reliable friends."
2340,"Arakkoa War Path : The arakkoa have attacked us again, this time striking in the night and then using their dark magic to escape before we could charge out to meet them in numbers.  They use their summoning circles to rescue their warriors from certain death but they cannot run from us if we attack their homes.  Veil Reskk and Veil Shienor lie to the north and northeast.  Find these arakkoa nests and kill as many as you can."
2341,"Alicia's Poem : Hi, I wrote a poem for my friend Caylee.  She likes to hang out with the Aldor in Shattrath City.  You know, in Outland?Could you take my poem to her?  My mommy says I'm too young to go to Shattrath City!"
2342,"Malevolent Remnants : Most of the spirits in the village are little more than pale remnants of Kirin Tor mages. They retain no knowledge of their former selves and wander the ruins in blind anger.It wasn't always like this, though. In the immediate aftermath of the attack, the spirits were restless, but not spiteful. With the passage of time they have only grown more aggressive. I dare not venture into the southern part of the village, for they will not spare even me. Quiet them and let us hope it will purge their anger."
2343,"Bloodgem Crystals : Kael's magisters have refined their usage of mana crystals to the point where they can siphon large amounts of energy in a matter of seconds.They do this by attuning smaller bloodgem crystal shards to larger, fully charged ones.Go to Manaforge B'naar and obtain one of these shards from a Sunfury magister and use it to siphon energy from one of the larger crystals.Return to me so that I may study the effects of the aura.  Do not worry; any side effects should be temporary."
2344,"Hitting the Motherlode : Now that we've got a good baseline product, we're going to need something of higher quality. Certainly the farahlite we've gathered so far is nice, but I know there's better out there.We'll have to get a sample directly from Cragskaar, the patriarch of the Farahlon giants! You should be able to find it among the other giants in the Netherstone area. It's got huge pieces of farahlite jutting from its back and that's exactly what we need. Fell the giant and collect a farahlite core from it."
2345,"Captain Tyralius : Captain Tyralius took a platoon of soldiers south towards the Ethereum Staging Grounds 10 days ago. We haven't heard from him or his crew since.Chances are good that they were ambushed and killed but I'm getting a curious reading from my instruments.I think it's a distress signal but these things have been wrong before. If Tyralius is still alive, they're keeping him in one of their prisons. You'll have to locate the prison and open it with a key, probably found on the warden."
2346,"Marking the Path : With the rock flayer population thinned, all that's left is to signal the safe path to our pilgrims.  Return to the Great Fissure with this torch and seek the three beacons that mark the path from the east.Light the three beacons and return to me.  Be warned that the beacons will attract any nearby rock flayers when you first light them."
2347,"Vision Guide : <race> fool.  You almost destroyed the drum!I've worked too hard to get here, and my hands have been empty up until now.  At least you were able to succeed where the others only met with failure, or worse.It is time to evoke a vision that will lead you to the last relic that I have been seeking.Take this fiery fragment of my soul.  Use it to transform your body into flame and denature your spirit into a vision guide that will shoot forth to reveal the location of the final Thunderlord relic."
2348,"The Spirit Polluted : Watoosun was able to shed the stink of corruption; but in doing so, created a twisted spirit essence. A spirit essence composed of the vilest corruption found amongst the elements!You will find this polluted spirit of the swamp southwest of here, hidden in the depths of Lake Sunspring.Find and destroy the polluted essence of Watoosun and any corrupt offspring that it may have created."
2349,"The Throne of the Elements : Greetings, <race>. I am Yal'hah, elementalist of the Earthen Ring. I have come to Garadar to inform the Mag'har of the state of the elements.Could I ask a favor of you? Would you travel to the Throne of the Elements in the northern hills of Nagrand, beyond Skysong Lake, and tell elementalist Sharvak that I have arrived at Garadar safely? She will surely reward you for this small deed."
2350,"The Elusive Ironjaw : Now that I have the fur I'll need for the trim, I've been thinking that the pelt of a particular wolf would make a good hood for my cloak. Imagine seeing your enemy clad in the pelt of the most cunning predator in the forest!I've tried trapping old Ironjaw without success. I've tried cornering him, outsmarting him, and baiting him. None of it has worked.He stalks the northeastern reaches of the forest, and I'd gladly reward you if you could succeed where I have failed."
2351,"Felling an Ancient Tree : WANTED!Stronglimb Deeproot, ancient of war and chief defender of the Living Grove south of Sylvanaar.Find him by heading west across the bridge that traverses the Bloodmaul Ravine.Return his hewn trunk to Tor'chunk Twoclaws inside the Thunderlord Stronghold inn."
2352,"Creating the Pendant : The arakkoa of Ruaan Weald elevate from their flock the Harbingers of the Raven, the heralds of their god.They believe that the Harbingers watch over them from the sky, where they receive the teachings of the Raven, and descend to pass this message along.The Harbingers hold a powerful sway over the souls of the arakkoa. They use magical pendants, which we need.Attract one of the Harbingers by slaying its flock and taking their claws. Place the claws upon the altar to get his attention."
2353,"The Dark Missive : The text on the note is written in some dark, indecipherable scrawl. The more you stare at them, the more the symbols seem to twist and burn before your eyes. There is only one at Honor Hold who can decipher such archaic script - the draenei mystic, Kryv. Take the Burning Legion Missive to Warp-Scryer Kryv who resides within the War-Room at Honor Hold."
2354,"Diagnosis: Critical : If Mehrdad's results are correct -- and I have no reason to believe they're faulty -- then the rest of the domes could be in trouble.I do think Mehrdad has failed to identify the underlying cause of the failures. From time to time, creatures damage the generators, but never this severely.To be on the safe side, I'd like for you to run a set of diagnostics at the Stormspire's main dome generator, located in Eco-Dome Sutheron at the very eastern edge of the dome."
2355,Uncatalogued Species : Lauranna must've missed this particular plant.  You're certain you've discovered a species not yet catalogued by Lauranna's work.  You'd best show it to her to see what she makes of it.
2356,"Bound for Glory : Now I can properly send you back to Shattrath City.  You've uncovered evidence of Kael'thas making pacts with the Burning Legion and you've got the key to the overlord's back door.Make sure Voren'thal doesn't topple over with excitement from the news - the old man's getting a bit fragile, if you know what I mean.  You'll find him inside the Seer's Library at the Scryer's Tier."
2357,"An Outside Perspective : Thank you for everything you have done for my people, but they are still scared of outsiders.  Fight the bog lords and rescue the spore sacs in the Spawning Glen. The future of my people is at stake!"
2358,"What Came First, the Drake or the Egg? : I'm researching the applications of drake essences to my work as a physician.  I think they could be a panacea for a host of maladies!I need someone to go south to the Singing Ridge and get me some.Willing to take my temporal phase modulator and use it on the nether whelps that hatch from the nether drake eggs?  Retrieve the essences from whatever they turn into.Which, I might add, I'm not certain of what that will be as we're using some pretty dicey, time  and space modifying tech here."
2359,"A Boaring Time for Grulloc : <name>, I have a pet boar named Huffer. He wants to help you to have some fun with one of the nearby sons of Gruul.Grulloc inhabits a place known as the Cursed Hollow. When you get there, let Huffer loose. The gronn will have a fine time chasing him around, and you will retrieve the bag that he guards and deliver it to Baron Sablemane.To get to the Cursed Hollow, head down the northern ramp and east through Dragons' End. The hollow is on the eastern edge."
2360,"Besieged! : Don't let your guard down, <race>. We're under constant assault from the Burning Legion.From their base of Legion Hold to the northwest, the demons rain down a ceaseless stream of infernals. As quickly as we can kill them, the new meteors impact and begin a new wave of attacks.My men are ragged and exhausted. I don't know how much longer they'll hold out. Please, <name>, lend your help to our defenses. Take your place on the line and halt the advance of the infernals!"
2361,"An Audience with the Prince : Nexus-Prince Haramad has conveyed to me that he is interested in the immediate return of this property to him personally.  I would greatly appreciate if you would deliver it in my stead.It is a great honor to gain an audience with the nexus-prince, and I am sure that he would be keenly interested in hearing the tales of your adventures here in the Netherstorm.Seek out his chamber atop the Stormspire to the north.  He is often present as a holographic image, which you may address."
2362,"Potential for Brain Damage = High : They're using relays to transfer information around the staging grounds.There is only one way for you to see these relays and extract the information they hold. Unfortunately, doing so may cause you irreparable brain damage.If you're still interested, you'll need to slay Ethereum here at the staging grounds and take their essences. Once you have an essence, drink it down. It will temporarily allow you to see an Ethereum relay - giving you enough time to destroy a relay and extract its information."
2363,"Atonement : Our history with the orcs is one of constant conflict, <name>.  We were once near driven to extinction due to their bloodlust and have since then avoided them even when not under demonic influence.Yet, this retaliation... it's not what Sedai would've wanted.  Speak with our elder, Amaan the Wise.  He will help shed light on these events."
2364,"The Encroaching Wilderness : We've been growing the Living Grove at an accelerated rate, but somehow the lynxes there have become lost to our control.Where once their population was stable, the grovestalker lynxes are now beginning to encroach upon Sylvanaar, and there have been a number of unpleasant incidents of late.I suspect that the arakkoa of Veil Lashh are somehow behind it, but the immediate issue is with the lynxes themselves.I would be most grateful if you would help us to deal with this situation."
2365,"Honor the Fallen : Hogarth, the commander of the Armory, is in the eastern tower.  You must report your victory over Urtrak to him.  Perhaps he will be friendly?  Of course he may try to consume your soul.  One can never tell with spirits such as these. The Unyielding are still against us and will no doubt kill you if they can.  Be careful <name>."
2366,"Setting Up the Bomb : We cannot permit the Legion to carry out its plan to destroy Wildhammer Stronghold on their march to the Black Temple.There's only one way to stop them, <name>. You must create an explosive large enough to destroy the Legion's entire stockpile of infernals at the hold.The Fetid Pool near Legion Hold holds an old fel reaver power core you could use as the base of your device. Search the other wreckage near the fel reaver for armor plating we might be able to make a casing from."
2367,"The Ring of Blood: The Blue Brothers : This next battle involves a duo - twin brothers to be precise. They call themselves the ""Blue Brothers.""It's not too late to chicken out, <name>. I'd certainly understand.But if you're ready for some action, step in the Ring of Blood and wait for the Murkblood twins to arrive.Last one standing is the winner!"
2368,"It's Just That Easy? : <Sal'salabim points to the blueprint.>You see where fel cannons are?<Sal'salabim draws an arrow denoting a change of direction.>You turn fel cannon around and use on structures.Wait! Don't be mad! One thing you not know. Overseers have key to turn cannons. You need key first! One from each overseer!Not so easy, eh?Take information back to Altruis."
2369,"Measuring Warp Energies : If our instincts are right and these manaforges have been made using technology from Tempest Keep, then all of Outland could be in grave danger.Tempest Keep's energy-recharging mechanisms were never supposed to be used this close to the land.  The warp energies are capable of destroying this very land, even when contained within Kael's pipelines.Take this orb to Manaforge B'naar; it is attuned to measure warp energies.  Use it at the pipelines' ends, where they go into the earth."
2370,"Cabal Orders : This message bears a dark seal and though the language seems somewhat familiar, it appears to be encoded.Perhaps someone at the Refugee Caravan will know something about it."
2371,"Rediscovering Your Roots : My stocks are presently sufficient, but I'll need plenty of razorthorn roots to keep up with the demand.Collecting the roots is difficult, but I know a special method of extraction.Using the glands of the Razorthorn flayers, one can control a ravager there and use it to expose a root.To find the roots, travel to Outlands and fly northeast from Shattrath until you reach Razorthorn Rise.Return to me, <name>, once you have collected five of the roots."
2372,"Did You Get The Note? : The cultist dropped this note, which apparently was to be delivered to Overseer Nuaar.  It is signed by someone named Kolphis Darkscale.It is likely that Tree Warden Chawn will be interested in looking at this."
2373,"Gorgrom the Dragon-Eater : We must show the ogres that we are not to be trifled with. We must send a message.Travel to Boulder'mok and kill the ogres there. Make sure you keep their heads.Then go to Gorgrom's altar and place the trap there for him. Gorgrom will appear, and you must lure him into the trap. When he is dead, mount your grisly totems near his corpse, so that the ogres may look at their fallen master and their fallen brothers, and know the price for seeking to destroy us."
2374,"The Hound-Master : Baelmon the Hound-Master must die!  He maintains the ritual that keeps the portal functioning.The Death's Door portal is located at the north end of the canyon.  When you find it, you will find Baelmon.You're going to need help on this one, so take this wand.  When you battle the Hound-Master, use it and a couple of my friends will come to your aid.After you have defeated Baelmon, return to Wildlord Antelarion.And, <name>, thank you for all that you've gone through for us here."
2375,"The Rod of Lianthe : The totem alone is not strong enough to counteract the sinister magics of the dark conclave.We can combine it with other objects of power, forming a staff to focus the energies. We cannot rescue my brethren from the depths of their depravity, but we can stop them.One of the items I need for the staff is the Rod of Lianthe, held by the blood elves at Eclipse Point to the southeast. It is kept in a pavilion on the top tier of the ruins and will be heavily guarded. Use caution, <name>."
2376,"An Improper Burial : Is there nothing that can be done to stem the tide of corruption? My soldiers have been battling the Auchenai for days now with no end in sight. Each casualty, whether Auchenai or Sha'tar, is snatched from the battlefield - their souls lifted and taken to parts unknown.I will not have it! A proper burial is out of the question but those fiends will not have their souls! Take this torch and travel to the field of battle, directly east of here. Burn every corpse you see! We will not fuel their rituals."
2377,Ishaal's Almanac : This mysterious tome was on Talonpriest Ishaal's body.  It contains arcane symbols and charts of celestial bodies beyond your comprehension.All writing is in a language you don't understand; likely an ancient version of the arakkoa written tongue.  Perhaps you should bring this to Sky Commander Adaris.
2378,"Return to the Scryers : This book... I could use it to increase my power tenfold...  No!  It would end up corrupting my very soul, this I am sure of.  Return to those who sent you here, <name>.You now have the means to stop Varedis.  Wait until he manifests his demonic form through metamorphosis, at that point you will need to burn the book in his presence.  That will be the only way you can deprive him of his power."
2379,"Returning the Favor : Now you must plant the seed of war in the fat, useless heads of the Warmaul. To the northwest, near the mountains, you will find the Laughing Skull Ruins.<Lantresor points into the crate of armaments you brought him.>Do you recognize those banners? They are Kil'sorrow banners. I want you to take a stack of Kil'sorrow banners and plant them on the corpses of Warmaul ogres. Remember, northwest is where you will find the ogres."
2380,"A Strange Weapon : You pull the stone axe out of the body to examine it more closely.  There's something unusual about the craftsmanship of the weapon.Its origin appears orcish, though the materials aren't like anything you've seen before.  Nazgrel might be interested in seeing the weapon."
2381,"Agitated Spirits of Skysong : The disturbance in the ebb and flow of the waters of Nagrand has greatly agitated the water spirits of Skysong Lake. They have in turn begun sowing destruction throughout the waterways of the area.Watoosun of the Water has come to us in a vision and granted us permission to remedy the problem - so long as the source of the disturbance is also dealt with...We will get to the source, but first you must deal with the problems immediate to the Throne. Destroy the agitated lake spirits and return to me."
2382,"Vile Idolatry : With our leadership in ruin, we are left open to attacks from all sides. The foul Murkblood tribe could not have picked a better time to attack us!In recent days, we have been subject to no less than 5 assaults from the Broken. They have even taken over our only other territorial holding in the area: Sunspring Post.We must strike and show them that we are not powerless! Strike down the vile idolaters and bring me their twisted idols of worship so that they may ride the lightning."
2383,"A Strange Vision : I've had a most unusual vision, <name>, and I don't know quite what to make of it. I've seen an arrow, an immense arrow, riding into the sky on a trail of fire. Such a feat is trivial for a skilled mage, but somehow I know the arrow I saw is not the product of magic.It will be unlike anything the people of Azeroth have ever achieved. You must seek out the people working on this, <name>. Lend them your help, for without it, their efforts may yet fail."
2384,A Personal Favor : Hmmm?  A box you say?  Or was it several?  Do you know what material the box was constructed from?And what was the name of this merchant?  Empoor?  Are you certain that he's one of the Broken?  I don't do much business with their kind.Perhaps my memory would be jogged if you were to do me a favor?The Skithian arakkoa - primitive casters that they are - recently stole a huge shipment of my more exotic goods.  I want it all back!You can find Veil Skith just to the south of Shattrath City.
2385,"Burn It Up... For the Horde! : I'm a lucky, lucky goblin.  I get to make explosives and killing machines, knowing they'll be used immediately on important missions!Speaking of missions, I just got one from Thrallmar command: burn the Alliance cannons on the far side of the Path of Glory... the ones pointing dangerously close to Horde fortifications.  Take this torch and make your way to each cannon.  Fire the torch and watch the sparks fly!"
2386,"Spinebreaker Post : <name>, my equipment here is, unfortunately, not configured for all the tests I'd like to perform.  However, my colleague at Spinebreaker Post, Apothecary Albreck, possesses the required implements.I have acquired a sample of Bleeding Hollow blood -- gained from a past mission of Thrallmar's agents.  Take the sample to Albreck and allow him to study it.To reach Spinebreaker Post, speak with Wing Commander Brack, near the wyverns to the south."
2387,"Spleendid! : Have you ever heard of food that cooks itself and stays hot forever? Dare to dream, I say!But maybe it's not a dream at all! Outside the fortress, near the lava pools and streams, you can find beasts that thrive in the sizzling heat. They're called felfire diemetradons.The dwarves around here tell me that those diemetradons have the tastiest spleens ever and that the spleens practically come pre-cooked! Bring me those spleens and I'll give you some coin.Start your search directly east of here."
2388,Because Kilrath is a Coward : Take what you have learned and tell Jorin at Garadar. I can assure you that he won't be happy to know that our village was destroyed and many of our people killed because the ogres needed more space.May the ancestors watch over you... I will be hiding in the bushes if you need me for anything else.
2389,"Corki's Ransom : <Arechron shows you a grime covered letter.>I just received this letter. It's from a clan of ogres known as Warmaul that rule the northwestern lands of Nagrand. It says that they have Corki and if we don't cooperate, they're going to eat him. Admittedly, Corki is a moron, but he's still my blood. Will you rescue him, <name>?I presume that he's locked up in a cage somewhere on Warmaul Hill. That should be your first stop."
2390,
2391,"Clues in the Thicket : I have no idea what killed all of the druids here.  I've been away for a couple of days on a survey of the Bone Wastes to the south.Please, you must help me to uncover what's behind this horrible tragedy.  Go into the thicket and look for a clue that might reveal something to us.  When I was in there briefly, I could have sworn I saw a dead Broken and a strange object next to him. And don't worry about Treelos - he might have been driven insane by what happened, but I think he's mostly harmless."
2392,"The Trappings of a Vindicator : I know it's strange, but I do want to stay in this cage.  It gives me the perfect opportunity to do what I came here for; to gather information on the Bladespire.I can leave at any time, but I would like to have my sword and shield back.Two of their leaders have my trappings.  Droggam has my sword and Mugdorg has my shield.If you have need, obtain and use the brew from Bloodmaul Outpost to the south to thin out their help and entice those two, but beware their sober guards who don't drink!"
2393,"The Sketh'lon Wreckage : The Sketh'lon Wreckage, just to the east, is an eerie place. The peons are convinced that it's cursed.There are few trees here, so the peons have no choice but to venture into the arakkoa ruins to chop wood. The arakkoa spirits prey on the work groups, draining their life and using it to fuel their foul magics.We must find out what is driving the dark conclave and stop them before their influence expands. Search the Sketh'lon Wreckage for evidence of their plans."
2394,
2395,"Standards and Practices : If you're venturing into the Burning Blade Ruins, I have a task for you. Take these Mag'har battle standards and place them at three distinct locations in the ogre compound. An area of high visibility is recommended. Look for the gigantic flaming pyres on the upper levels. Place a standard near the first, second, and third Burning Blade pyres.The standard will leave a lasting impression upon any ogres who may have missed the battle."
2396,"Bleeding Hollow Supply Crates : The Boulderfist have moved the supplies they stole from our village to the twin clefts of Nagrand, found west of here in the Halaani Basin.While you are in the area, keep your eye out for the supply crates. If we can get those back, it would ease much of the burden that has fallen upon the matrons of Garadar."
2397,"Overlord Gorefist : The centerpiece of any ogre tribe is its leader. Without leadership, the Ango'rosh's organization will disappear and they'll resort to infighting to determine who will lead next.Although we've seen the ogres out and about in this area, their true strength is concentrated in their Ango'rosh Stronghold to the northwest. It's located in a cave on a small island connected to the marsh by a fallen mushroom.Go there and defeat Overlord Gorefist. That should provide us with a well-deserved respite."
2398,"Wind Trader Lathrai : I was asked to pick up and deliver some boxes of goods from an ethereal in Shattrath City.Last I saw him, he was standing outside of the World's End Tavern in Lower City.  His name is Wind Trader Lathrai, and that's all that I know!Want more answers, go talk with him!"
2399,"The Bladespire Ogres : To the north of the Bloodmaul clan lies a threat more grave:  Bladespire Hold.The Bladespire ogres are the strongest clan in the mountains, having the favor of the gronn known as Gruul the Dragonkiller, and his seven sons.Now that we've dealt with winnowing the Bloodmaul, it is time to turn our eye upon their rivals.From Bloodmaul Hold head north through the ravine until you come to Bladespire Hold and the Bladespire Grounds.  Slay as many of the Bladespire ogres therein as you can."
2400,"Expedition Point : Your battle prowess has been noted by high command, <class>. They want to send you to the front lines to meet up with Rohamus's crew. They're radicals, devoted to the complete extermination of the Burning Legion, so you may fit right in...Head east about 400 paces, across the Valley of Bones, until you run into a destroyed fel reaver. You'll see Expedition Point where a Legion base used to stand. Once there, you are to report to Forward Commander Kingston.Now move out!"
2401,"The Agitated Ancestors : Do you see them walking around us? The Ancestral Grounds are normally quiet and undisturbed.As of late, the ancestral spirits have risen and are extremely agitated. Something is causing a great disturbance to the spirits. We must discover what that something could be, but first, we must put the immediate threat to rest.These ghosts that you see walking about are not truly the ancestors but a representation of their state of being. You must destroy the agitated orc spirits. Do this and return to me."
2402,"Deceive thy Enemy : For every moment I hear silence, you draw closer to your death! SPEAK!What? The camp has revolted? This cannot possibly be true! My minions would not dare undermine my authority.Well then, every last one of them will pay for this treachery, they will pay dearly. Silence them all and be done with it! Report back to me once you have carried out my order or you shall be dealt with."
2403,"He Will Walk The Earth... : Will you do me one last honor, <name>? I do not wish to return to Garadar. I believe that my destiny lies elsewhere - that I will serve a greater purpose someday.Please, return to Farseer Corhuk and tell him that I will not be returning. That I cannot return. I must walk the earth... He will understand."
2404,A Mission of Mercy : We salvaged this prison orb on our last scouting mission into Ethereum territory. We'd have never found it had it not been for the distress signal that it was faintly emitting.We think one of our own might be locked up in there but we have no way of opening the orb up without harming whatever is inside.What we know about the Ethereum is that any of their members could - at any given time - be carrying a key to unlock an orb. Retrieve one and return so that we may uncover the mysteries of this orb.
2405,"Unfinished Business : The first expedition the league sent reported encountering a gigantic spore bat they'd taken to calling Sporewing. They had to leave in a hurry, so they didn't have the chance to kill him while they were here, so I figured I'd finish the job for them.What's left of their report suggests that the creature can be found in the southwestern parts of the Dead Mire. I think Vindicator Idaar mentioned that it's to the northeast of Telredor."
2406,"Gaining Access : According to Razuun's orders, the massive infernal staging area is called Invasion Point: Cataclysm and it's nestled in the northern mountains. The only way to reach it is by using a teleporter located at Legion Hold.Certain members of the Legion host carry devices allowing them to activate the teleporters. You must capture one of these devices to win access to the teleporter. Slaughter all of the demons if you must, but you can't afford to return empty-handed."
2407,"The Second Course... : I remember seeing larger diemetradons east of the Hand of Gul'dan, near the lava flows around the Ruins of Baa'ri. What I want you to get for me now is one overdeveloped felfire gizzard from the beasts around that area. You might have to kill several to find a gizzard like the one I described. Keep at it! One of them is bound to have my next meal."
2408,"Invaluable Asset Zapping : See the fissure running through Area 52?  We did that!  <grin>It's yielding up all sorts of goodies for the X-52 Nether-Rocket, but we're running short on equipment.We had an operation at the Arklon Ruins to the southeast until the Burning Legion moved in.  I need you to take this Ultra Deconsolodation Zapper to the ruins.  Use it to beam our gear back to Lead Sapper Blastfizzle down in the fissure.Junior Technician 3rd Grade <name>, this is your chance for that promotion.  Don't blow it!"
2409,"There's No Explanation for Fashion : <Magasha chuckles softly to herself.>I bet if they knew they were wearing bug parts, the fashion trend would end very quickly.We first started killing the bugs 'round here 'cause they were getting in the way of our construction. Some enterprising merchant stops here, spends the night, and next thing you know he's buyin' up all the bug wings we have!Says he makes clothes out of 'em. I be stickin' to my armor, thanks. But if you gather the wings of any of the fireflies, I'll gladly buy 'em."
2410,"Taken in the Night : Our small outpost is under constant attack. Several nights ago, we were raided by the spiders of Netherweb Ridge, on the southeastern edge of the Bone Wastes. They poisoned many of our people, wrapped them in webs and carried them away. Some of our warriors took up arms and with little preparation pursued the spiders.We have not seen the captives or our hunting parties since. We hope that some may still be alive, perhaps imprisoned by the spiders.  Our numbers are few. Will you search for our people?"
2411,"Protecting Our Own : With the magical dust you recovered, I have fashioned a magic ointment that will aid in our own defenses.Our dire wolves are the perfect combination of mount, sentry and friend, but the Alliance scum have been poaching them in the Jagged Ridge.<name>, I want you to take this ointment and apply it to our dire wolf friends.  The Alliance will get a rude surprise the next time that they send one of their hunting parties.Be aware though that some of the wolves may not like this, and will turn on you."
2412,"Arrival in Outland : I want you to speak with Amish Wildhammer, standing about 30 paces south of us, and catch the first flight to Honor Hold. When you arrive at Honor Hold, you'll be greeted by Marshal Isildor. I have prepared a report detailing our situation here.  Give him the report, and tell him you're ready for duty.You have your orders, soldier, now move out!  And though your blood must be burning to help us against the fiends below, waste no time here.  Honor Hold needs you even more."
2413,"The Exorcism of Colonel Jules : <name>, it is time to save Colonel Jules.  His condition has worsened and Barada fears that, if we do not cleanse him of his corruption,  he will be lost to us.Take the prayer beads you found and speak with Anchorite Barada to begin the ritual.  Let no disruptions stop the ritual... and if all goes well, Colonel Jules will be saved.  Speak with Jules when he is saved, then return to me."
2414,"Blast the Gateway : We have to shut down this gateway to stop Legion reinforcements to the Isle of Quel'Danas.Take these embers, they contain one of my creations: a living flare.  It is designed to act as a powerful destructive force - as long as it has been provided enough energy.Find the fel sparks that wander the area and slay them near the living flare.  The flare will grow in power each time, until it becomes unstable.Once you've achieved this bring the flare to the gateway.  It will know what to do."
2415,"A Visit With The Ancestors : I need for you to journey to the villages of the ancestors, <name>. Seek each one out and see if the ancestors remain.Visit Sunspring Post to the north, visit the Laughing Skull Ruins far to the north against the mountains, visit Garadar to the northeast, and finally, visit the Bleeding Hollow Ruins on the borders of Nagrand and the Terokkar Forest, to the east.Return to me once you have observed the ancestors in their homes."
2416,"And Now, the Moment of Truth : The oil is finally ready for its first test. It seems heavy enough to serve as a high quality weapon oil.The only way to find out is to have a professional try it out. See Grek over there by the wanted posters? Sure, he's no poet, but the orc knows his way around a weapon!Take a sample of the oil to him and ask him to use it on his weapon. After he's had a chance to test it out, let me know what he thinks of it."
2417,"The Ring of Blood: Rokdar the Sundered Lord : This fight is gonna be painful, <name>. Do you have any friends that are brave enough to help you out? The ogres managed to get a giant from Blade's Edge named Rokdar! Trust me, you're gonna need friends, he seems unbeatable! He's hard as a rock - literally!If you still want to fight him, step into the Ring of Blood and he will come."
2418,
2419,"Bonechewer Blood : Bonechewers!  They should all die!  The sight of their red skin and depravity makes my blood boil!I have a mission for you, <name>.  Kill Bonechewer orcs and collect their vile blood.  There is an apothecary who needs the blood for her tests, so we can discover how these orcs fell to the demon taint, a taint from which we so recently freed ourselves.Bonechewers scavenge near the ruined battlements along the Path of Glory, to the south.  Return to me when your mission is complete."
2420,"The Consortium Needs You! : My organization, the Consortium, is looking for a few resourceful individuals just like yourself.  You'll be hard pressed to find ethereals more honest, hard-working or pleasant to be around than us.All we require is loyalty, dedication and a reasonable amount of moral flexibility.  If you're interested, speak to Gezhe, our ground operations leader.  You will find him at Aeris Landing, north of Oshu'gun."
2421,"The Twin Clefts of Nagrand : You made a strong showing, <name>. Are you ready for more?I have received reports of a large contingent of Boulderfist ogres hidden in the twin clefts of Nagrand, northwest of here in the Halaani Basin.Venture forth to the clefts and deal with the remaining Boulderfist ogres."
2422,"Return to the Greatmother : Return to Greatmother Geyah at Garadar with news of your victory, <name>. This will surely lift the spirits of the Mag'har. Perhaps even the young Hellscream will be lifted from his malaise."
2423,"What Are These Things? : I don't know about you, but I have no idea what all of those things are.  I do know one thing though - they look dangerous!<name>, I think you should take this box of parts to Jenai Starwhisper at the Allerian Stronghold to the southeast.  She may have some idea of what these are."
2424,"Outside Assistance : The Sunfury briefings support the theory that Kael'thas has been receiving outside help in constructing and running these manaforges.  Who this is remains a bit of a mystery, though we're likely to find out in Manaforge Ara.I've sent a group of my men to scout the surrounding area.  Go to Tuluman's Landing, north of here, and speak to Kaylaan.  See what he's discovered at Manaforge Ara.  Find out who is assisting the Sunfury army and take care of them."
2425,"Idols of the Feralfen : From what you've told me about your observations at the Boha'mu Ruins, it seems this tribe of Lost Ones has reverted to the worship of animal spirits. Before we can approach them, we must know more of their beliefs.Return to Feralfen Village and discreetly gather some of their idols so that I may study them. Try to avoid angering them, <name>, as it may hurt our chances of making contact with them."
2426,"I Work... For the Horde! : Would you believe it?  These orcs hired me to help them shore up damaged fortifications and build explosives.  What a dream job!  It's too bad we're so short on materials, but a clever goblin like myself learns how to make do!Can you help me?  I need salvaged wood and metal from the ruined battlements along the Path of Glory.  Go down there and salvage, and watch out for those red-skinned orcs!When you're done, come back for big rewards!"
2427,"Return to Thrallmar : Hope you enjoyed your flight, friend. A messenger arrived while you were away - seems Nazgrel's got a new use for you. You'd best head back to Thrallmar and check in with him. I have a feeling the Legion's just getting warmed up."
2428,"Stealing from Thieves : Nexus Prince Haramad has ordered us to not begin work inside of Oshu'gun as it might anger a certain powerful naaru.  Sort of puts a damper on our operation.I think I might've found a loophole, however.You see, we're not the only ethereals drawn to this colossal diamond.  A thief called Gava'xi has led a band of rogue ethereals into Oshu'gun and they've begun to dislodge large fragments from it.Your job, <race>, is to go there and retrieve what is rightfully ours."
2429,"I Must Have Them! : Do you see them?? By Gazlowe's horrific halitosis, I will have those eggs! Say, you look like you might be of some use.I'll tell you what, <race>; if you gather a few items for me to make my Jump-a-tron 4000 functional, I'll give you a key that will let you operate the machine as well! What can you do with a Jump-a-tron 4000 you say? What can't you do is more like it...I'll need air elemental gas from the air elementals of Nagrand. They're all over the place so don't ask me where to find 'em!"
2430,"Aldor No More : My mission here is finished.  I did what Orelis ordered me to - I've never failed to.No more.  I foresee a great carnage - a crusade, they'll call it - following the news of this alliance between Kael'thas and the Burning Legion.First they give our holiest city away to our enemies and then they ask us to die fighting their enemies.  Go back to Orelis; tell him the naaru can fight their own fights from now on."
2431,"A Mystifying Vision : A strange vision haunts me, <name>. I see a continuous cloud of smoke ascending toward the sky, left in the wake of a giant fire moving ever faster away. It is not a natural phenomenon, nor a creation of evil; that much I know.I have no knowledge of what it looks like, save that it is the product of the labor of many. Yet, without more hands, it may never come to be.Travel to Netherstorm, <class>. Locate those responsible for this creation and offer them your aid."
2432,"Hungry Nether Rays : Nether rays are surprisingly loyal and obedient once properly trained.  Unfortunately the war on Skettis is taking a toll on them.We have dozens of sorties a day - the poor fellows rarely get a break.  And with recent shortages on feed, if those blasted birdmen don't kill them on a mission then starvation will.If you can lend a hand, take one of our rays to the woods in the south.  They don't mind warp chaser meat as long as it's a fresh kill."
2433,"The Ring of Blood: Skra'gath : You're murderin' 'em out there, kid! They got a ringer for the next match. They say he's a void lord or something... No way do they want you up against their champion. Did you here that palooka, Mogor, yapping at you? The bets are through the roof!Get in that ring and take this one out fast!"
2434,Observing the Sporelings : We need to learn all that we can of the sporelings at Sporeggar and their relationship to the creatures around them.  One way to do that is what I'm doing; passive observation while making a note of their interactions.I need you to head over to the Spawning Glen to the west.  Investigate the whole area and then return to tell me what you saw.
2435,"The Firewing Liaison : Over the past couple of days, I've observed a blood elf woman traveling to and from the fel orc stronghold and conversing with the fel orc leader. From her body language, she's clearly issuing orders. But why? Whose orders is she conveying?My curiosity got the better of my judgment and I shadowed her when she left the fel orc encampment. She headed north, to Firewing Point. I stopped before reaching the perimeter of the blood elf outpost.Kill her before she leaves the fel orc camp again."
2436,"The Lexicon Demonica : Recreating the enchantments on the blade requires several spells to be spoken in demonic.It's not something I was taught during my training as an apprentice, but there's no way around it. There's a book, called the Lexicon Demonica, that will provide most of the words I need, but it's in the hands of a powerful Shadow Council warlock.Deep in the halls of Auchindoun's Shadow Labyrinth, it is held by Grandmaster Vorpil. Do whatever you must to secure the book and bring it to me."
2437,"Not On My Watch! : The battle plans were written up by an ogre lieutenant. His name is either Dump or Lump.<Bintook turns the parchment sideways and cocks her head.>It could also be Billy.Anyhow, I think you should go back out there and have a word with Billy or Lump or Dumpy or whatever! Try to approach him diplomatically. If that doesn't work, try using some muscle."
2438,"Shutting Down Manaforge Coruu : Your success at B'naar has given us a great deal of hope, <name>.We've shared our discoveries with the Scryers and in return they've given us more information on the remaining manaforges.Three other manaforges still stand, in full control of the Sunfury army.You will find Manaforge Coruu to the east.  Overseer Seylanna holds the access crystal there.  Obtain it and use it on the manaforge's control console to begin the emergency shutdown.We're all counting on you, <name>."
2439,"The Path of Anguish : Doom Lord Kazzak commands the Burning Legion in Outland. While we can't get to Kazzak - yet - we can and must get to his lieutenants that command Legion troops from the ground.They have stationed dreadlords at the Path of Anguish, east of here. They are the ones responsible for these infernal storms that rain down upon our heads. To take them and their minions out would be a great set back to the Burning Legion."
2440,"The Stones of Vekh'nir : The arakkoa of Vekh'nir have been a thorn in our sides for many years. Some strange religion guides them, a religion which has the arakkoa in a frenzy of activity. They carry these crystals with them now, which they have turned to some dark purpose.I know something of their rituals. They take the crystals to their spell circles to infuse them. We at the village would like to know more. Waylay a few of the arakkoa until you find a crystal, charge it, then return it to me."
2441,"The Ashtongue Tribe : The Ashtongue tribe is feared among all Broken.  It consists of the most vicious and bloodthirsty individuals, handpicked by Akama himself.  They are as fierce and ruthless as any naga, demon or blood elf in Illidan's army and they have been deployed in large numbers at the Ruins of Baa'ri, southwest of here.  Go there and put a dent in their numbers before they get a chance to mount an attack on us."
2442,"Hero's Call: Shadowmoon Valley! : All able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Prophet Velen in Shadowmoon Valley on Draenor.  The destruction of the Dark Portal has stopped the Iron Horde invasion of Azeroth, but now we must to take the fight to them.  With Prophet Velen's blessing, we will be able to establish a strategic position in Draenor to fight against the enemies of Azeroth.  Glory to the Alliance!"
2443,"A Warm Welcome : While the druids from the expedition have made themselves busy studying plants and researching the lakes, I've made it my business to deal with the hostiles in the area.Ever since we set foot in Zangarmarsh, the naga have launched lethal attacks against us without warning.  We've done our best to keep them at bay, but our resources are limited.I want you to go to the various naga strongholds in Zangarmarsh and show them that we're not to be crossed.  Bring me their claws as proof of your victories."
2444,"Ethereum Data : Look around you, fleshling. Very close to this transponder should be an Ethereum data cell. Locate that data cell, open it, and retrieve the contents.Bring it back to this transponder at once!"
2445,"Menacing Marshfangs : During the orcs' war against my people, gatherers rarely left Telredor for fear of being attacked or captured. Now, we venture out more often, but the marsh is no less perilous.It seems that the nether rays have grown bolder in recent months. I don't know if it has something to do with more competition for their normal prey, but they've been attacking our foraging parties on a regular basis. If we can thin their ranks in the area around Telredor, perhaps they would learn to leave us alone."
2446,"In Need of Felblood : Northeast of here lie the Pools of Aggonar.  Once a sacred site to the draenei, their waters were corrupted after the blood from the demon Aggonar was spilled into them.That blood, though old and diluted, still possesses tremendous power.  Terrorfiends now walk the area, empowered by the pure demonic energies of the original blood.  Slay them and retrieve as much felblood as you can.  I'll make it worth your while."
2447,"To Skettis! : The Barrier Hills are only one of the fronts where we've been deployed.  A less immediate but far more dangerous threat looms from beyond the Skethyl Mountains, from within the arakkoa city of Skettis.A few months ago our scouts detected a huge increase in arakkoa activity there.  Several attacks against Shattrath followed.  We've stationed forces outside of their city since.Take these explosives to Sergeant Doryn at Blackwind Landing, just outside Skettis.  Tell him you're a new recruit."
2448,"The Mistress Revealed : I'm Arelion's friend, but I'm not going to take the beating of my life for him.  His mistress is Viera Sunwhisper.Go tell that harpy of a wife of his.  What's she going to do anyway?"
2449,"Test Flight: The Singing Ridge : I've been fiddling with the Zephyrium Capicitorium and I'm ready to perform another test!  Do you want to help?This next flight should be short, but fast!Um... and although I'm sure there's no danger... I have this, uh, waiver that I'd like  you to sign.  It's just a formality, I assure you!Best of luck!  Talk to Rally to launch yourself, and come back to me after the experiment is over!"
2450,"Potential Energy Source : We are not the only ones battling the influx of the mana beings. The blood elves, too, are troubled by them, but I'm not sure why.Whatever they're involved in over there, they don't seem to be stopping. Instead, I've seen them employ a variety of methods to kill the creatures. The most effective involves magical defenses fueled by some sort of concentrated energy.Capture some of these energy sources and bring them to me. Don't hesitate to stymie the elves if an opportunity presents itself."
2451,"Finding the Survivors : If I know anything about ogres, it's that they like their food fresh. This means that the Mag'har that they captured are more than likely being kept alive until they are ready to serve. It's a sickening thought, I know, but one that we must use to our advantage.Venture to Warmaul Hill and search for Mag'har prisoners. If you find prisoners, then you will find keys to their cages on the nearby Warmaul ogres.Kill ogres for their keys and release the prisoners."
2452,"Fertile Spores : Spore bats and marsh walkers accumulate fertile spores on their appendages from wandering around the tallstalk mushrooms in the marsh.As you can see, we're a short people so our options for gathering these spores are limited.  Seek out the spore bats and marsh walkers and gather the fertile spores.  All of Sporeggar will be in your debt."
2453,"Veil Rhaze: Unliving Evil : Veil Rhaze was a particularly wicked colony of Skettis.Despite the village's eradication by the Auchindoun disaster, Terokk's influence remained in the maligned spirits there. Travel west to Veil Rhaze and slay those murderous wretches. You'll find them to the west of the Shadow Tomb, on the border of Bone Wastes and Terokkar Forest.This will be our first blow against Terokk and the guardians of Skettis."
2454,"World of Shadows : Sky Commander Adaris was seriously injured during a Skettis incursion.  He's been in and out of consciousness since.I fear he has succumbed to a feverish delirium.  During brief lucid moments he demands that I prepare an elixir made from shadow dust carried by the arakkoa.  He seems to believe it will allow him to see into a ""world of shadows"" where the arakkoa's true leaders dwell.I do not believe this nonsense for a second, but I fear he won't rest until I obtain such an elixir.  Will you help?"
2455,"Whispers on the Wind : I have chased rumors of the Mok'Nathal across Outland with nothing to show for it. Finally, we may have found their home.But now that the moment is here, I am filled with unease. Unease that has kept me awake deep into the nights during my search. Will they accept me?I... know their leader's name: Leoroxx. Seek him out. You must be my eyes in this."
2456,"Massacre at Gruul's Lair : You've proven yourself resourceful, and now I think I'm going to put you to personal use in my own fight against Gruul and his sons.The Bladespire clan are the favored of the gronn, and while you may have thinned out their numbers elsewhere, you haven't yet dealt with their strongest.Gruul protects the exterior of his lair with only the toughest of ogres, and it is those that you must kill.  Head north through the Daggermaw Canyon and you will find Gruul's Lair at the end."
2457,Bane of the Illidari : <David gathers his smithing supplies.>You've done well in getting everything we'll need to reforge the anti-demon blade. Your hard work and dedication is about to be repaid.The time has come to forge the sword.
2458,"A Defector : We've recently been contacted by a Sunfury magister who wishes to join our ranks and swears he has information we're in need of.  We've checked our informants to make sure he's not a double agent and he checks out.He's stationed in Manaforge Ara which makes communication difficult.  Talk to him and see what he knows.  If he's half as useful as he claims to be, we'll be able to put him to good use."
2459,"Drijya Needs Your Help : <class>, it is good to see a helpful face around here.The Burning Legion at the nearby fel reaver heap has become more bold, and I am beginning to fear for our safety here.  The demons are constantly receiving reinforcements from Invasion Point: Destroyer to the south.My compatriot, Drijya, has gone down there to scout and see if he can do something about the Burning Legion's warp-gate.Please find and assist him in any way that you can."
2460,"Trial of the Naaru: Mercy : Four trials you must pass before you are deemed worthy by the naaru.Within the Shattered Halls of Hellfire Citadel are three of your people. They are held there by the merciless one, Kargath Bladefist. He seeks to execute them as a sign of his virility and power. You must save these prisoners before such an atrocity can come to pass. As proof of deed, bring me the unused axe of the executioner. It must not have a drop of blood on its blade!"
2461,"Hazzik's Bargain : Do not draw attention to our conversation.  Adaris would not approve.I belong to the lowest caste of arakkoa, <name>.  During Terokk's rule I would've been sacrificed to the dark powers worshipped by his talonpriests.  If what you say is true and the talonpriests are seeking Terokk's return, then you must prevent them from succeeding - regardless of what your leader says!I've something to offer you that you'll find useful.  There is a package at my old dwelling in Upper Veil Shil'ak.  Bring it to me!"
2462,"Malaise : The magic practiced by the Lashh'an arakkoa is unnatural. They rip out handfuls-clawfuls?-of their own feathers as reagents!That doesn't sound like good magic to me. I've come here to learn more about their spells. Unfortunately getting close is too much for me.You could succeed: cast one of their spells on yourself, then return to me. You'll have to find one of their spellbooks, high up in the trees of Veil Lashh.And unless you've grown feathers I can't see, you'll need to get some of those."
2463,"WANTED: Worg Master Kruush : The poster reads:""Worg Master Kruush leads the worg riders of the Bleeding Hollow clan.  A price has been placed on his head, for his riders exact heavy tolls on supply trains to Spinebreaker Post.""""Scouts report him within Zeth'Gor, and the hero able to bring the severed head of this villain to me will earn the thanks of the Horde, and a large bounty.""""-Captain Darkhowl"""
2464,
2465,"Return to the Aldor : This book... I could use it to increase my power tenfold...  No!  It would end up corrupting my very soul, this I am sure of.  Return to those who sent you here, <name>.You now have the means to stop Varedis.  Wait until he manifests his demonic form through metamorphosis, at that point you will need to burn the book in his presence.  That will be the only way you can deprive him of his power."
2466,Killing the Crawlers : Tor'chunk Twoclaws wants this tunnel cleared out so we can expedite trade with Swamp Rat. I must not leave my post here so I am leaving the task in your hands. Clear the tunnel and report to Tor'chunk Twoclaws at once!
2467,"The Underneath : Something rails the underneath. It beats the ground as if to punish.*Thud*<Untrag beats his chest with his fist.>It makes this sound a hundred-thousand times. Endlessly it beats. The earth reels. It is calling out to us now.Gordawg speaks to me. Gordawg knows that something forces the elements out. Something from the underneath.Go now and speak to Gordawg. No, listen to Gordawg, do not speak. Hear Gordawg..."
2468,"A Lingering Suspicion : The strange magical device resembles nothing you've ever seen before. It's certainly not of blood elf manufacture.As you sense spirits moving closer to the building, the orb glows with a greater intensity, which fades as the spirits leave. There's no question that it plays a role in the corruption of the ghosts.How it works remains a mystery. Perhaps Custodian Dieworth will have some insight if you can provide the remains of some of the spirits along with your observations."
2469,"Watcher Leesa'oh : There's important research to be conducted into the ecology of the local creatures, especially the sporelings and bog lords of the marsh.  And trust me, once you get out into the field, you'll find the work to be challenging.Seek out Watcher Leesa'oh at the Cenarion Watchpost in the western region of the marsh toward the south.  Follow the path west and you will eventually find her.  She can be a bit -- studious -- but don't let that get to you.Oh, and watch out for her cat."
2470,"Creatures of the Eco-Domes : Your work with the lashers turned up some astounding information, but I wonder if it holds true for animals as well.Gathering information on the talbuks that live underneath this dome is going to be trickier than studying the lashers, I'm afraid.Using this tagging device, you can put a weakened talbuk to sleep and apply a tag that I'll use to track the animal as it matures. The tagging mechanism won't work unless the talbuk has expended most of its energy."
2471,"All Clear! : Before we can begin the test, we have to make certain the area is clear of anything that might interfere. In our case, that means these overgrown lizards.<Tashar gestures toward the scythetooth raptors.>There's no telling what might happen if one those decides to take a nice bite out of the generator while it's charging. I've seen a lot of strange things in all my years as a technician, including more than a few abominations that had their beginnings as humble animals."
2472,"Crimson Crystal Clue : As the colossus falls under the weight of your attacks, you notice for the first time that it was holding a red crystal fragment.While it was small and unnoticeable in the mountain giant's hand, it's a fairly hefty piece for you to carry around.  It also suspiciously looks like it's a piece of the giant crystal in the middle of the ridge.It's most definitely a clue as to the strangeness that is occurring here, and you're sure that the druids at the Cenarion Post to the south will want to see it."
2473,"Decipher the Tome : This tome appears to be some sort of history written in a secret Alliance cipher.  Althen, the historian in Spinebreaker Post, has studied the Unyielding for some time; he may be able to crack the Alliance code and decipher the book."
2474,"The Agony and the Darkness : Greetings, <name>. I've deciphered the Legion missive and uncovered the demons' strategic plans for this Peninsula. Apparently, there is a large group of hellish terrorfiends gathering near the Pools of Aggonar in the west. We cannot allow such a force to go unchallenged. You must go there and decimate their cursed numbers."
2475,"Inform Leoroxx! : Quickly, you must inform Leoroxx of what is transpiring up at Razaan's Landing!Those orbs were comprised of souls, some of them Mok'Nathal!"
2476,"Drill the Drillmaster : I'm receiving reports that the Shattered Hand fel orcs, out in front of Hellfire Citadel, are organizing for what looks like an all-out assault.  No doubt, they're not happy about your successes against all of the clans.Get to the base of the citadel, where the Path of Glory ends.  You'll find the fel orcs busy with their preparations, but you're going to catch them with their pants down.Eliminate the one that's in charge of that force.  Kill Drillmaster Zurok!"
2477,"Muck Diving : The most affected elements of water can be found in the Halaani Basin, southwest of here, beneath the abandoned city of Halaa. While some distressed elements can be destroyed without any impact upon the environment, spawns of muck must be physically removed from the world once destroyed.You see, muck spawns leave behind globules of tainted debris that if left untouched will spread and further contaminate the environment.Destroy these muck spawns and bring back their muck-ridden cores."
2478,"High Value Targets : Based on the roster information, we know that the brains of the manaforge operations are the warp-masters and warp-engineers.  It is they who oversee the retrieval of a so called ""warp-energy"" by the manaforge and its delivery to a remote destination via a system of underground pipes.The only other specialists in the area are geologists.  Everyone else is either part of the military or a magister crony; both easily replaced.Get in there and kill Kael's specialists; that's what'll hurt him the most."
2479,"One Demon's Trash... : You look like a capable young <man/woman>!  I was wondering if you could lend me a hand?To the east is the Scrap Field, which the Burning Legion has moved into.  It's full of huge fel reaver parts.  There're also a whole bunch of smaller parts in there that they don't seem to care about.I want you to get in there and get me a lot of those smaller fel reaver parts!"
2480,"Electro-Shock Goodness! : Around the ruined manaforge you will find the run-off of Dimensius's handy work. Seeping sludge occupies the pools that surround Ultris. Directly below those pools, where the Ethereum Staging Grounds now stand, you will find even more run-off in the form of void waste.The best method of disposal is to use electro-shock to break slimes down to globules. Use this elixir to augment your attacks with electricity. The resultant discharge will break the slimes up into their raw form. Destroy the globules!"
2481,A Hero Is Needed : It is not enough. A hero is needed. Our forces are overwhelmed as the Auchenai continue to grow in number.<Commander Ra'vaj looks at you.>Will you be the hero? Return to the field of battle and strike at their soldiers. Keep them occupied so that my scouts can get behind their lines and see what they are creating.
2482,"Reinforcements for Garadar : <Still catching his breath, the messenger gestures for you to sit.>They may not survive, <race>! Get to Garadar as quickly as your legs will carry you.<In response to your blank stare, the messenger elaborates.>The home of the Mag'har, lies to the south, in Nagrand. Take the southern road out of the marsh, then turn east at the first fork and look for a large settlement on the lake.Find our commander, Captain Kroghan, there and offer him what assistance you can. Garadar must not fall!"
2483,"Find the Deserter : I get the feeling that all the pieces are here, but I just can't put them together in a way that makes sense.I think our best lead is to attempt to locate this deserter. If he left his comrades at the camp, there's a chance you might be able to persuade him to help us understand what the dark conclave arakkoa are planning.Start your search for him along the road in Magma Fields to the northwest. It seems a likely place for him to take refuge."
2484,"The Ruins of Burning Blade : These ogre hunting parties are a precursor to invasion. We must strike at them before they have a chance to amass an army big enough to take over our town.You're going to need to get your hands dirty, <race>.The largest collection of Boulderfist in this region can be found at the Burning Blade Ruins, almost directly east of Telaar, near the border of Terokkar. Go there and show the Boulderfist that Telaar will not bend to their will!"
2485,"Essence for the Engines : As the X-52's chief of engineering, I have to see to it that the nether-rocket's main engines are in tip-top shape.Unfortunately, I haven't built them yet.<class>, I'm in dire straits here!  I have almost all of the parts.  All that I'm missing is the engine core.Luckily for us, I think we can make use of the essence from the local mana wraiths to jump-start the engines.They can be found near most of the glowing trenches in the northern part of the island.  Except for here in Area 52, of course."
2486,"Sunfury Briefings : Something about these manaforges has been bothering me, <name>.  Naaru technology is incredibly advanced; it should've taken Kael'thas years to even begin to understand it.Information-gathering on the subject has been difficult as Kael's army is well disciplined and destroys all evidence of written communication.We've been informed Manaforge Duro is under attack by mana creatures.  It is possible that those defending it have not yet destroyed their briefings.  Obtain them and bring them to me."
2487,"The Multiphase Survey : I'm sure that 'gnomish inventor' is a crackpot. He was babbling about some dark distortions that have begun to appear in the Spirit Fields around Oshu'gun in Nagrand.According to him, these, uh, multiphase... um, spectro-goggles will allow the wearer to see the distortions and take readings from them. He insisted that recording this data was fundamental to our campaign at the Sunwell. I think he's nuts, but I'm under orders to investigate anything that might help. Would you mind taking some readings?"
2488,"Now That We're Still Friends... : Reports have come in that the naga of the Bloodscale Enclave to the northeast continue to kill our people.  We thought that you had dealt with this, <class>!I suggest that you to teach them a lesson as proof of our continued friendship."
2489,"In Search of Sedai : Hear my plight, <class>.  My brother, Sedai, left long ago to contact the orcs of Mag'har Post.  Ever the idealist, he thought the time was ripe to set our differences aside and negotiate a peace with them.He's been missing for days and I fear for the worst.Would you set my mind to rest and look for him?  Sedai must be somewhere nearby to the east."
2490,"Rebuilding the Staff : <Ravandwyr inspects the staff, noting that part of the headpiece seems to be missing.>Simply barbaric! Ekkorash must've taken the staff's crystalline headpiece for use in some other trinket, not realizing that it works in concert with the rest of the staff.As long as it remains broken, the staff's power is greatly diminished. With a suitable draenei crystal, I should be able to repair it. I've heard the goblins remarking about the crystals carried by the ghosts at the Enkaat Ruins to the north."
2491,"Ethereum Prisoner I.D. Catalogue : I am in need of more I.D tags, <name>. What I've discovered thus far is that this is not just a way to catalogue prisoners but it also documents locations!Once this code is broken we'll be able to pinpoint exactly where all of our allies are held and free them with minimal hostile action received."
2492,"Withered Basidium : A close inspection of the basidium reveals a number of indentations that might have once held something. The alien mass of fungus presents something of a puzzle. It's far from healthy, but you have little clue as to what function it might normally perform.Perhaps someone more familiar with the denizens of Zangarmarsh would be able to tell you more about the basidium."
2493,"Laying Waste to the Unwanted : Now that we've gotten our salvage operation off the ground, it's time to begin the second phase of the plan.Across the Path of Glory, the Horde still has their old blade throwers trained on us. Don't let their age fool you, <name>, they're still very dangerous. Much as we're working to reclaim what we can, we can't assume the Horde is going to dismantle their weaponry.Take this torch and burn the remaining siege equipment. I'll take no chances with Honor Hold's safety."
2494,"A Timely Summons from Shattrath : The blazing star holds a peculiar alignment this cycle, calling out across the heavens. Seek out the sage Vormu in Shattrath City, and lend her your aid."
2495,"Message in a Battle : Ogres are moved by one thing: Might. If we expose ourselves to them as being weak, they will take advantage of that weakness and wipe us out.Garrosh might be ready to lie down and let the ogre dogs take our lands but I am not! I need you to deliver a message to the Boulderfist, <name>. The only type of message that they are capable of understanding: Brutality.Travel to the Burning Blade Ruins, southeast of here and show them the might of the Mag'har.And <name>, check in with the others before leaving."
2496,"The Inconsolable Chieftain : You have done so much for the Mag'har, <name>. Your accomplishments are known to all, including Garrosh. Go to him now and tell him of your latest victory. Tell him that you do what you do for him and his people. Surely he will be lifted by your words."
2497,"Helping the Lost Find Their Way : Many spirits of the draenei were corrupted by the explosion of Auchindoun.  Now they wander the wastes in torment.<name>, I beseech you to put them to rest.  Destroy the lost spirits and broken skeletons that haunt the Bone Wastes beyond Auchindoun's walls.What?  You think leaving them to wander in blind agony would be better?Afterward, return to Soolaveen at the Refugee Caravan and tell him of that which you have done."
2498,"The Great Fissure : We're dangerously close to becoming fenced in by Alliance forces.  With the influx of sin'dorei pilgrims from Azeroth, we must establish a route that's safe from our enemies' prying eyes.I've given it some thought and have arrived at a solution.  We're to establish a secret path through the Great Fissure.Yes, even though the area is crawling with brutal rock flayers, they are merely beasts and can be taught to fear us.  I want you to go and kill a good number of them.  They shall learn fear."
2499,"A Shabby Disguise : Open the package, <name>.  It is a disguise.  It doesn't look very convincing, does it?I craft them for ethereal smugglers in search of rare books.  There is an arakkoa scribe who dwells in the central island in Skettis, Terokk's Rest; his name is Sahaak.  He is old and nearly blind.Use the disguise to speak with him and obtain the book known as the Adversarial Bloodlines.  Be careful, <name>.  The disguise won't fool the other arakkoa."
2500,"Lines of Communication : One of the reasons Ikuti led us to Zangarmarsh was to help open the lines of communication between the draenei and the Kurenai home city of Telaar in Nagrand. In order for messengers to pass swiftly between Telaar and Telredor, the roads must be secured.On our way here, we were attacked repeatedly by marshfang slicers. We were able to fight them off, but they would pose a formidable threat to a solitary messenger. Reducing their numbers will help ensure the safety of our messengers."
2501,"The Tomb of Lights : To the east, buried under the charred sand, is the Tomb of Lights, a lost resting place of the dead.  Before our caravan was ambushed I was going to journey to the tomb and cleanse it of evil spirits.  Little did I know it was already infested with another kind of evil.  Even now the ethereals plunder the bodies of the fallen for trinkets and keepsakes that were given to the dead centuries ago.  There is little I can do while our caravan struggles to survive."
2502,"A Dire Situation : With their wolf pack reduced, the Horde is looking for replacements.  Unfortunately there's another source nearby.The Bloodmaul ogres in the ravine below to the east keep a strong pack as their own sentries.  I hated sending you to kill the Thunderlord wolves, so why don't we do something different this time?I've derived a magic powder from the dust that naturally falls off the wings of our fey drakes.  Sprinkle it on the Bloodmaul dire wolves to make them undesirable to the Horde."
2503,"Wyrmskull Watcher : Hmm, I'm not certain what we should do.  I'm not much of a military planner.Watcher Moonshade will know what to do.  He's heading up our defensive efforts at the Wyrmskull Tunnel to the west at the end of Wyrmskull Bridge.  We have a force out there just in case the cultists try anything funny.Please, take the note to him with all due haste."
2504,"Krasus's Compendium : The Kirin Tor sent one other of Krasus's possessions with our expedition. It was his spellbook, called Krasus's Compendium. Containing all the spells he mastered, it lent us a much-needed advantage in the war.Before Kael'thas and his forces laid siege to Kirin'Var, the compendium had been stolen from me by a rebellious apprentice intent on studying necromancy. The apprentice and his followers divided and studied the text in secret, locking themselves inside their houses in the southern part of town."
2505,"Searching for Evidence : Whoever is behind the transformation of the spirits has been very deliberate in their actions, taking care to target the most powerful mages first, but why? The kind of magic required to influence the spirits of slain Kirin Tor mages must be very powerful.Why would a powerful mage go to all this trouble? I'm inclined to say this is another plot of Kael'thas's, designed to cause more misery here. If there are blood elves here, they're likely to be hiding in the houses across the covered bridge."
2506,"A Question of Gluttony : I was wondering why the bog lords were crossing the road to go to the Spawning Glen - they must be starving for some reason.  This just will not do!I mean, normally I wouldn't get involved, but if they continue to eat all of the sporeling pods they'll wipe them out!Here's what we'll do: I'll stay here and you head to the Quagg Ridge to the east and look for dietary clues as to why they're raiding the sporelings."
2507,"The Dead Mire : I have lived among the anchorites of Telredor for some time, <name>, and in that time I've come to know the marsh quite well. Recently, I've started to notice a disturbing change in the land to the northeast.Virtually all life there has begun to wither and die, seemingly without explanation. I have a few ideas as to what might be happening, but they are little more than speculation. If you were to bring me a sample of the soil in that area, I may be able to get to the bottom of this mystery."
2508,"Return to Shattrath : Your actions, while brave, will surely rouse a vindictive response from Terokk.Hurry to Shattrath. Send word to Rilak!"
2509,"Report to Nazgrel : <name>, during your foray with the Demoniac Scryer, I sent word of your exploits against the fel orcs.  Nazgrel, our illustrious leader in Thrallmar, wishes to speak with you.  I believe he has a bloody mission in mind..."
2510,"It's a Trap! : There's nothing more that I hate in this world than the sons of Gruul and their father!  They slaughtered my people, and my children, and now I will have a taste of revenge!I have fashioned a trap from some dragon fire, and if you're clever enough, you might just be able to use it to kill a gronn.I'm sure that you have a particular gronn in mind; it matters not to me which one you kill.  Just hurry, take the trap to your Commander Stonewall.My thirst for revenge must be quenched!"
2511,"The Flesh Lies... : You see these corpses, <race>? Arconus is responsible for this slaughter. He's sucked them dry, leaving nothing more than a fleshy husk. But don't let the bodies fool you! Inside those corpses lie flesh beasts, waiting to pounce on the unsuspecting fool that gets too close.I've got my orders. I must remain here until backup arrives. That doesn't mean that you can't take my igniter and destroy the withered corpses that litter the mines. One way or another, the mission must be completed."
2512,"Bloody Imp-ossible! : The blood of the warp chasers in this area is a powerful and rare reagent. It's one of my biggest sellers.Normally, I take my imp, Zeppit, out to help me gather it. Warp chaser blood is simply too caustic to be handled safely by you or I, but it doesn't bother Zeppit.Things are getting busier here at the shop, so if I send Zeppit with you, will you help gather the blood? Zeppit's attention tends to wander, so you'll need to be close to the chaser when it dies for Zeppit to do his work."
2513,"Sha'naar Relics : As I've told you before, I do not require eyes to see what others cannot.  I will not pass judgment on what you did on Makuru's behalf, yet I think you need to see beyond what your eyes show you.Travel southwest to the Ruins of Sha'naar and salvage any relics you find.  If fate wills it you will find what we need.The meaning of my request might not be immediately apparent.  Have faith though, <name>.  Clarity comes to those with patience."
2514,"Shatter Point : <name>, you've done a great job here at the front, and you showed a lot of talent with that armored gryphon... I think I have another mission in mind for you.This new mission launches from Shatter Point -- an attack base the Wildhammers set up on a floating piece of land near the Portal.  It's a little unnerving there, but you have tough guts.  You'll be fine.Talk to Wing Commander Dabir'ee and have him send you to Shatter Point.  From there, report to the gryphon master Runetog Wildhammer."
2515,"Forge Camp: Mageddon : <name>, we have reason to believe that the easternmost forge camp is not yet complete. The Legion's gan'arg servants are working 'round the clock to get the facility up and running. We can't allow that to happen. Head east to Forge Camp: Mageddon and slay 10 gan'arg. Bring me the head of their master - Razorsaw - and the Legion's fel reaver production will grind to a halt!"
2516,"Fel Orc Scavengers : Scavengers, orcs of the Bonechewer clan, skulk about the ruined battlements overlooking the Path of Glory.  We must assume that these fel orcs are gathering war machine parts for their masters within Hellfire Citadel -- they must be stopped!Find Bonechewer orcs to the north, <name>.  Find them and slay them!  But use caution, for although these orcs are the lesser of the fel orc clans, their strength is the match of any green-skinned orc we've faced thus far..."
2517,"Death's Door : Now there is an even greater threat from the Burning Legion.  To the south is a portal known as Death's Door, which opens upon the horrific world where the Legion breeds its deadly hounds.To get there, exit Evergrove by heading east up the ramp.  Follow the path south, through the Bladed Gulch, Razaan's Landing, Razor Ridge and the Scalewing Shelf.  Then, take the ramp down into the Vekhaar Stand and enter Death's Door through the tunnel, south of Mok'Nathal.Once there, use this druid signal."
2518,"Doctor Vomisa, Ph.T. : On the outskirts of town to the east are the Proving Grounds.  Our top experimentalist, Doctor Vomisa, has been toying with a combination of fel reaver, ethereal, and of course, goblin technologies there.This is in no small part thanks to your gathering efforts Junior Technician 3rd Grade, <name>!Go to him; I know that he'll have a solution for saving Area 52.And since he's likely to use you as a test subject, if I were you, I'd bring some friends along just in case."
2519,"Glowcap Mushrooms : I've seen your kind use shiny round pieces of metal to trade for things that you need.  We're not so different from you.  We use shiny round mushrooms as our currency.Glowcap mushrooms grow everywhere in the marsh, you just have to know how to pick them from the ground without wrecking them.  I'll teach you how to do it, if you promise to bring us some for our reserves.  What do you say, <name>?"
2520,"The Count of the Marshes : This bloody mandible comes from an unbelievably large creature. The nether ray that it belonged to has to be the largest ever seen in Zangarmarsh. Judging from the condition of the mandible, the count must've abandoned a diet of carrion in favor of living flesh.Surely the Cenarion Expedition would be interested in such a specimen. Watcher Leesa'oh has a small camp to the west of Quagg Ridge."
2521,"Dust from the Drakes : The Alliance has recently moved in to the west, using their elven magics to grow a town and grove in a short matter of time.  We must keep their defenses weak so that they do not also grow a spine.I have a plan that will do that and more.  I want you to traverse the bridge to the southwest, which crosses over Bloodmaul Ravine and leads into the Living Grove.Attack their fey drake defenses in the Living Grove and bring back the magical dust that sometimes can be found upon their wings."
2522,"Baron Sablemane's Poison : Here, take this to your master. I'm sure that whatever the reason, Rexxar will put it to good use.Oh, and do be certain to remind him that he owes me.He knows what I want, and I'm certain that however he intends to obtain it for me, I'll be seeing you again sooner than you think.Now, do be a good little <boy/girl> and run this up to Rexxar."
2523,"Sketh'lon Feathers : There is one last element missing from the staff. We must direct the staff's power toward the Dark Conclave spirits.We can do that by gathering feathers scattered on the ground at the Sketh'lon Base Camp and using them in the staff. The base camp is to the south, east of Wildhammer Stronghold.Gul'dan's magic utterly destroyed my brethren, leaving only their spirits, but it did not stop there. The magic fed on the spell the arakkoa were preparing, forging a sinister force that engulfed the spirits."
2524,"Ruthless Cunning : <Lantresor hands you a pack full of banners.>These are Warmaul ogre banners that I recently acquired.I want you to travel to Kil'sorrow Fortress, directly south of here, and kill as many of the Kil'sorrow filth as you can find. Drive a Warmaul ogre banner through the heart of each fallen Kil'sorrow soldier. Return to me when you have completed this task and the other that this plan requires."
2525,"Thick Hydra Scales : Reavij was wise to bring leather armor. This swamp will render my mail useless before long.I've been replacing the scales bit by bit as I'm able. The hydra in the marsh have thick, protective scales that stand up well to the dampness of their home.Finding suitable ones is a tedious process, though. All too often, the best scales are torn or worn too thin for use in armor. Bring me any good ones that you might get from the hydra in the larger lakes."
2526,"Patriarch Ironjaw : You've done well in gathering the first pelts.The final piece of the vestments requires a pelt unlike any other. There is one particular wolf, an old and cunning one, that has earned his place as the patriarch of the forest wolves. He is known among them as Ironjaw, the mighty hunter.In my visions, I have seen him wandering the northeastern region of the forest. Including his pelt in the vestments will surely light the wolf spirit's path.Do not mourn Ironjaw. He will be well honored."
2527,"The Dying Balance : Have you observed your surroundings closely, <name>? This is an ailing landscape, struggling to keep itself in balance and losing the fight.If you know where to look, you can see the symptoms. Members of some species rapidly outgrow their peers and become more aggressive.A good example of this uncontrolled growth is the marshtrekker Boglash. If you wish to see it for yourself, look no further than the waterways south of the refuge.Be prepared to defend yourself. The creature knows no mercy."
2528,How to Serve Goblins : Why would fel orcs steal my shredder parts?  I hate them so much.  They just sneak into my camp here and take things all the time.  A couple of days ago they stole three of my peons!  Now the rest of my peons have run off because they are afraid they are going to be eaten by fel orcs.  I can't run a mine without peons.  If you could save the peons that I lost maybe the others would come back.  The fel orcs have their camps along the wall to the southwest.
2529,"Testing the Antidote : I think there's something we can use in the blood as the base of an antidote. Don't look at me like I've lost my mind!It's a common theme in nature. Often, the cure for something can be derived from the toxin itself. That's just what I aim to do.Ridding the boars of their demonic influence would probably eliminate their aggression and give us insight into how to best attempt to help other species."
2530,"Once Were Warriors : I do not know you, stranger, but I ask for your help. I feel shame for this, but I am only one orc.Emotions have surfaced that I have never felt. I... I seek vengeance. Blood for blood. Do your people ever feel this? I wish to pick up my axe and split my enemies in two. To swing the weapon until my arms fall lifelessly at my sides, exhausted.Sunspring Post is directly south of this procession. It is there that you will find our enemies... Kill them... Kill them all..."
2531,"Survey the Land : To be my eyes will require some diligence on your part. Nethrandamus will take you through the Legion camps, but you must catalog everything that you see. Even the smallest detail that you may think to be inconsequential could be useful for our purposes.Primarily, I want you to note what structures are in the camps and what comprises the camps' defenses.Nethrandamus is ready when you are, <name>. Do not be afraid, he will keep you safe from harm."
2532,"Unruly Neighbors : The recent arrival of the fel orcs at the ruins to the east both puzzles and troubles Thander. They wasted no time in starting to construct fortifications and repair the buildings.The construction goes on day and night, <name>. I've dispatched one of my most reliable agents to keep watch, but we can ill afford to delay action. Move against their workers, then seek out Theloria Shadecloak at the Allerian Post to the north of the Bonechewer Ruins. She'll give you further instructions."
2533,"The Longbeards : We were having a problem with arakkoa bandits raiding many of our supply caravans, so I hired some dwarves to take care of them.They were brothers; Gremni Longbeard was the oldest.I'm a little worried about them.  Those crazy dwarves packed more ale than food or ammunition!  Maybe you can go check up on them?The arakkoa's hideout, the Den of Haal'esh, can be found to the far west of here - beyond the Great Fissure.  They set up camp northwest of there, south of Dustquill Ravine."
2534,"Trial of the Naaru: Strength : Four trials you must pass before you are deemed worthy by the naaru.The trial of strength is divided in two. You must destroy the leader of the Coilfang Steamvaults, Warlord Kalithresh, and bring me his trident. Slay the extra-planar being known as Murmur, in the Shadow Labyrinth of Auchindoun, and bring me his essence.Do this and you will have passed the trial of strength."
2535,"Ridgespine Menace : We hired on to help Toshley when he decided to move to Outland, and we've been on the move ever since.Now it looks like we've finally put down some roots.  All of the crazy scientists have their projects going, and us Roughriders are here to protect them.What we need right now is for you to go north into Razor Ridge, or east to the Scalewing Shelf, and keep them clear by killing the stalkers.  They're stealthy spiders that live amongst the rock outcroppings, and jump unsuspecting passersby."
2536,"Cannons of Rage : There is a second production facility, Forge Camp: Rage, that lies to the immediate northeast of Thrallmar. The demons have positioned a number of their fel cannons along the ridge - and they're aimed straight at us! You must enter the camp and destroy these fel cannons. <name>, you must be sure to detonate them all - or nothing will stop the Legion from raining fiery hell down upon our heads!"
2537,"Minions of the Shadow Council : <Zagran listens to you recount the events at Legion Hold, nodding.>That fills in the gaps we've seen. We've caught glimpses of them launching infernals in the direction of the hold, but haven't been able to find much more than that.The Shadow Council has the forge pretty much locked down. Looks like you're going to need to fight your way in. Start eliminating the Shadow Council guarding the entrance to the Deathforge!"
2538,"Return to Honor Hold : <name>, while you were on your mission in Zeth'Gor, I received news of my commanding officer, Colonel Jules.  He was stricken with a demonic corruption while fighting near the Gor'gaz Outpost, and his situation has grown very bad.You have made such great gains for us against the fel orcs.  Your strength in battle is without question... is your spirit just as strong?Please, return to Honor Hold and speak with Klatu, in an upper room at the Honor Hold inn."
2539,"A Message to Telaar : You've been honorable in our dealings, <name>, at a time when trust is hard to win among my people.A large group of my brethren have made their home in the old draenei city of Telaar in Nagrand, to the south. To reach Telaar, take the road south into Nagrand, then continue southeast until you find yourself in the cliffs east of Oshu'gun.Anyone who has aided us, as you have, would be welcome among the people of Telaar.Seek out Nahuud and tell him you have earned my trust."
2540,"The Great Retribution : You did well against the Ashtongue Broken, <name>.  I have another challenge for you, should you be up to it.Not too long ago, the Sanctum of the Stars suffered a tremendous attack by Illidan's fel orcs.We've determined it was perpetrated by the Shadowmoon orcs who occupy the Ata'mal Terrace.Show them that the Scryers are not to be trifled with."
2541,Surveying the Ruins : I have to get over to the Ruins of Farahlon to start my excavations!  The problem is that the place has been infested by demons!Maybe you could do some preliminary work for me?There are three locations within the ruins to the northeast where I want you to place surveying markers.  Each is near a draenei banner.Return to me when you've managed to place all three markers.
2542,"Vestments of the Wolf Spirit : Generations ago, when orc clans still called Terokkar Forest home, the wolf spirit played an important role in their lives. When the orcs departed, they had no longer had any need for the spirit and they left it behind.In time, the spirit grew lonely and it too left the forest.I believe I can bring the wolf spirit back to his ancestral home, just as we orcs have returned. The ritual will require me to create vestments from the pelts of the wolves of the forest to guide the spirit back to its home."
2543,"WANTED: Bonelashers Dead! : The bonelashers of the Bone Wastes bit Mawg and made him sick.  Now he wants all of them destroyed!While they can be found throughout the wastes, they are known to congregate at Carrion Hill in the north.Return to Mawg Grimshot after you've done the deed and he'll give you a good reward."
2544,"The Respect of Another : Magasha is the fiercest troll in the Marsh, but she only respects mighty hunters.   I tried to prove myself to her, but the one beast that could impress her is beyond my skill. Maybe you could help me out? It's the giant bog wasp known as Blacksting that roams the area south of the glowing draenei towers to the west. If you bring me its stinger maybe she'll give me a chance to join her hunters.  I know it's a little sneaky, but I promise to learn under her and do ya both proud."
2545,"Withered Flesh : We must determine how far the damage has spread. The basidium you brought me comes from a bog giant. Their larger, hardier cousins, the bog lords, should prove more resistant to the degeneration that's struck the giants.It would be good to know how the changes in the Dead Mire have affected the other creatures out there, too.Return to the Dead Mire and see if you can get samples from the bog lords and the hydra in the area."
2546,The Battle Horn : Perhaps we have taken the wrong approach to the Unyielding? The tome tells me the Expedition Armory was destroyed by orcs and death knights long ago.  The Unyielding remain here as vengeful spirits trapped in an eternal battle against the fel orc clans.  They think only of revenge.  We must arrange for them to defeat their most hated enemies.  Enter the Expedition Armory once again and find Lieutenant Commander Thalvos.  He carries a battle horn that can summon the Unyielding.  Bring it to me.
2547,"The Earthbinder : You should take the crystal lump over to the earthbinder.  She's just like you... always needing to get to the bottom of a mystery and thinking all of the time.If you ask me, she thinks a little too much.Just give it to her and I'm sure that she'll get you into a heap of trouble figuring out what is going on up there on the ridge."
2548,Return to Thalodien : It would be best if this information got back to Thalodien as soon as possible.  I'll stay here and cover our tracks.It wouldn't do us much good to have Kael'thas find out what we were snooping around here.  Secret information is always better if your enemy doesn't know you have it.
2549,"War on the Warmaul : We were en route to the Ancestral Grounds when we were ambushed by Warmaul. They came from all sides, killing several of the procession guards and many of the others. They even desecrated the remains of the elder in the wagon.And for what? So they could humiliate us and display their power. Not even Boulderfist would have sunk so low.I am a spiritual orc, <name>, but even I have limitations. Find the attackers at Warmaul Hill to the northwest and destroy them!"
2550,"A Promising Start : We've come here to investigate rumors of a strange breed of dragons, perhaps even descendents of Deathwing himself. These are clearly not ordinary black dragons, though.We'll know more once we've had a chance to examine their eggs. Their hatred for my flight runs deep, so I can't get close enough to gather the eggs. Will you agree to help?"
2551,"Needs More Cowbell : Where, oh where has my Bessy gone? After the attack, I searched the fields and the Chapel Yard for her, but she was nowhere to be seen!All I have left of her is this old cowbell. She usually comes running when she hears it, but these feeble old bones probably couldn't shake it hard enough.I'll loan you Bessy's bell if you're willing to go out to the fields and ring it as hard as you can. Perhaps all Bessy's waiting for is a little more cowbell."
2552,"The Unending Invasion : Kael'thas's assault on Kirin'Var began with thundering noise and a bright flash of light in the officer quarters to the northwest. The destruction there was the most severe and after the withdrawal of the blood elves, a strange thing began to happen.Beings of pure mana began streaming into the village from all over the area. For now, we're containing them as we can, but with more information about the weapon Kael'thas used, I hope to cut off the flow of mana creatures entirely."
2553,"Searching for Scout Jyoba : Now that you're familiar with the terrain, I'd like to ask your help with something else. The Dead Mire, we've taken to calling the area to the northwest, is an eerie place. No one has ever reported seeing anything alive there, but they didn't stay for very long, either.Scout Jyoba volunteered to investigate the area and report on his findings. He left the post three days ago and hasn't returned. It's not like him to be gone that long without sending some kind of report. Will you search for him, <name>?"
2554,"Escape from Firewing Point! : Thank goodness for you!<class>, I need you to help me escape.  I have information vital to the security of the Allerian Stronghold and probably all of Outland!I came here from the Cenarion Expedition on a diplomatic mission, but as you can see, they weren't very friendly.  If you help me get to safety, I can assure you that you will be handsomely rewarded!We won't be able to do this on our own - you do have a group with you, right?"
2555,"Blacksting's Bane : By Khaz'goroth's flaming navel, it's hot here! I can't blame the first party for leaving, but everyone knows 'twasn't the heat that drove them away. No, it was Blacksting, although they won't admit it.They were camped just to the south of the glowing draenei towers to the west, just north of the Feralfen Village, when the giant wasp appears out of nowhere and attacks! I can't wait to see the looks on their faces when I bring the creature's stinger back to Ironforge and show it to them!"
2556,"The Bladespire Threat : There is a threat to Thunderlord Stronghold worse than the Alliance at Sylvanaar.I speak of the ogres of these mountains.  Just to the west, down in the ravine, lies the Bladespire clan.  While they aren't the only ogres, they are the closest and they're the ones that we defeated to take this place.Head north through the Jagged Ridge, and then down the path, which leads to their hold.  Slay as many of the Bladespire ogres and their raptors as you can at Bladespire Hold and the Bladespire Grounds."
2557,"Into the Draenethyst Mine : Well it's good to see someone who's willing to help out around here!Borgrim and I are part of the Explorers' League, and we're here to learn what we can of these mountains.  We've heard all sorts of tales, and I can't wait to get settled in and started.One thing in particular has caught my attention.  The night elves speak of a place down in the ravine to the east known as the Draenethyst Mine.  It's at the south end of Bloodmaul Outpost.  I'd like some of the crystals that grow naturally therein."
2558,"Baron Sablemane : Here is my plan. We will poison the ogres and then destroy their gronn master.During my travels in these mountains, I met a man named Baron Sablemane. He is a master of the alchemical arts, and may be convinced to assist us.You will find him at the Circle of Blood, down in the canyon to the north of here. Whatever price he requires, I will leave it to your discretion to accept."
2559,"Warlord of the Bleeding Hollow : You have shown great strength and fortune, for you have delved into Zeth'Gor and lived!  Now, let us hope your fortune holds, for I have a dire task to ask of you...Warlord Morkh sits within the barracks of Zeth'Gor, commanding his fel troops against us.  His tactics are as clever as they are cruel, and I must admit that his successes against us have cut deep.  And so, <name>, I ask you to remove Morkh from his seat.  Bring me his armor so that we might display it for our soldiers and bolster them."
2560,"A Rare Bean : You are ill-equipped to face the restless elements of Nagrand. Before you can help the Earthen Ring, you must help yourself.To the west you will find dung heaps left behind by the wildlife of Nagrand. You must search the dung for the digested remnants of the Nagrand caracoli. From this bean I am able to make a tablet that will aid you in your battle against the restless forces of nature.Return to me when you have collected no less than two fists worth of caracoli... Ogre sized fists."
2561,"To Meet Mother Kashur : Do not be alarmed by what you might see once the effect has taken hold! These spirits are all around us - always. The potion allows your mind to be able to understand and ultimately see the spirits. You will need to be under its influence if you are to speak with Mother Kashur.You will find her a great ways to the southwest, at the Ancestral Grounds."
2562,"What's Wrong at Cenarion Thicket? : Hey there, <class>.  We haven't heard from the druids of the Cenarion Thicket in quite some time.I want you to go over there and check to see what's happening.  You can find it by heading northwest through the forest."
2563,"An Unnatural Drought : The soil sample you brought me is nearly devoid of moisture, <name>. If the soil itself is losing moisture, then the creatures that live in the Dead Mire must be suffering terribly.I've seen what happens when the region's fungal giants begin to wither and die. The pain drives them mad, causing them to attack anything in their path.These creatures have no idea what's happening to them. They're beyond our ability to save, so the best we can do is to end their suffering."
2564,"Kill the Shadow Council! : What!  Those guys are Shadow Council?!<name>, you have to go back in there and waste them!  I want you to take out their leader and as many of their executioners and summoners as you can.After you're done with that, report back to Lieutenant Gravelhammer at the Allerian Stronghold.Good luck, <class>!"
2565,"Maktu's Revenge : Last time Maktu was out hunting hydras for hides at Serpent Lake, he was attacked by the biggest hydra he's ever seen. Maktu reached for his spear, but it was too late. He had just enough time to escape becoming hydra food.Who knows? Maybe next time, Maktu not be so lucky. Maktu wants to be there so there won't be a next time. Will you help Maktu get his revenge on Mragesh?"
2566,Return to Sha'tari Base Camp : We will not make it back on our own.  The dreadfang poison is too strong. You must return to Sha'tari Base Camp for us.  Scout Navrin will send a rescue party out to find us.
2567,"Hail, Commander! : Captain <name>!<Taskmaster Varkule salutes you.>Overlord Mor'ghor has asked to see you in his chambers at once!"
2568,"No More Mushrooms! : Mushroom soup, mushroom stew, mushroom sauce!Mushroom, mushroom, mushroom! It's all there is to eat around here. If you say you're hungry, the cook hands you an axe and tells you to go chop down your dinner!Well, I'm tired of mushrooms. I've seen fish in the lakes around here. Sure, they look like a nasty piece of work, but they've got to be better than mushrooms!How much will it cost me to hire you to bring me my first decent meal in weeks?"
2569,"Fulgor Spores : There is little in this swamp that will burn, <race>, so we must resort to other means for lighting Telredor. Many of the creatures and plants in the marsh emit a soft glow.It's difficult and cruel to confine the glowing creatures, so we've turned to a species of mushroom for our light source.We pick and cultivate the fulgor mushroom here, but our needs require us to gather new crops occasionally. The small green mushrooms often grow at the base of larger ones near Telredor."
2570,"The Warchief's Mandate : As you know, the warchief put his power behind this expedition for one reason.  This is the world we came from.  This is where our roots lie.This journey means different things to orcs and blood elves.  To them it's a search for the promised land.  To us it's more like returning home.Whoever made this axe is familiar with the old ways and we must contact them.  This is too important for us to use ordinary tracking methods.  Show the weapon to Far Seer Regulkut; she will know what to do."
2571,"Sporeggar : You're a kind <race>, <name>.  Not like some of the others I've met.You should meet the rest of my people; they'll be very grateful for your help.  Take these spore sacs to my leader, Msshi'fn.  You will find him in Sporeggar, north of here."
2572,An Ally in Lower City : There is an arakkoa in Lower City by the name of Rilak...  He can be trusted.  Take the book... to him.<Adaris drifts into unconsciousness as he returns the book to you.>
2573,"Obsidian Warbeads : All this waiting around for Oshu'gun to be ready for digging is eating into our profits, <name>.Fortunately, I've devised an alternate source of income.  The ogres of Nagrand wear warbeads made of obsidian, a mineral that commands a hefty price in many other worlds.Zerid already has had to take care a few of the brutes as a matter of security.  Think of the warbeads as an added bonus.  Or better yet, don't think about it too much and just bring them to me."
2574,"Down With Daellis : I'll never forget the blood elf who led the attack. He wore a tabard with a device I've never seen before, over top of crimson armor.He was ferocious and merciless, leading from the front where most other blood elf officers would never be seen. He was responsible for the deaths of many Kirin Tor mages that day, but he didn't linger long at Sunfury Hold. Kael'thas has ordered him to Manaforge Duro to aid in their attempt to control the area. Find him, <name>, and silence his bow for good."
2575,"A Dark Pact : We've been so blind, <name>, that the alliance of two of our most dangerous enemies went completely unnoticed.I wouldn't be surprised if the Scryers had something to do with hiding this information from us, but we must now face the reality.  The Burning Legion and Kael'thas' Sunfury army serve under the same banner.These demons are the only reason Kael'thas was ever able to utilize the technology in Tempest Keep.  Under Orelis's orders I must command you to destroy them."
2576,"Angling to Beat the Competition : It's a relief to be in someplace with water after trekking through the wasteland of Hellfire Peninsula. I was worried there might not be any respectable fishing holes in Outland.Now I'm glad I lugged my fishing supplies along. For the most part, the fishing's been good, except for those no good fenclaw thrashers in Serpent Lake.Not only do they scare the fish away, but they're bold enough to snap the bait right off my hook. I spend more time re-baiting the hook than I do catching anything!"
2577,"The Biggest of Them All : You've dealt with most of the little hydra, but I doubt Mragesh was impressed by your display. He's a cunning, ferocious beast and he's dogged many an angler in his time.I intend to be the last one he'll ever bother. He's bound to be hiding deep in the waters of Serpent Lake, to the northeast. He's a has-been; he just doesn't know it yet."
2578,"Thin the Flock : The arakkoa have attacked us again, this time striking in the night and then using their dark magic to escape before we could marshal our soldiers.  Veil Reskk and Veil Shienor lie to the north and northwest.  Find these arakkoa nests and kill as many as you can.  They may not fear us, but at least we can thin their numbers."
2579,"Daggerfen Deviance : The Kurenai and the draenei don't always see eye to eye, particularly on the issue of the Lost Ones. We are content to help the Lost Ones who seek us out, but we won't pursue them. Some draenei are intent on 'redeeming' them all.However, there are times when even the Lost Ones go too far, such as the Daggerfen. In their village to the west, they dabble in poisons and deceit, arts that come unnaturally to us.We must put an end to this before the vile Daggerfen can extend their influence."
2580,"Marauding Wolves : The filthy races of the Horde have taken over a settlement to the east.  They've brought with them a large pack of the dire wolves that they prefer to use as mounts and sentries.These sentries have been marauding across the bridge that separates us.  They've been stalking our fey drakes, which are critical to the pollination of the Living Grove.Use the east exit to traverse the bridge over Bloodmaul Ravine that leads to the Jagged Ridge to the east, and bring me their tails as proof!"
2581,"Shutting Down Manaforge Duro : So Manaforge Duro is under attack and Sunfury forces have lost control?  What a dilemma!  If Duro goes down, then Tempest Keep goes down.  Only drawback is... if Tempest Keep is destroyed, the explosion will probably take what little remains of this forsaken land with it.Dead Kael'thas is good.  Dead everyone else is... not that great, I suppose.  It pains me to ask this of you, but go to Manaforge Duro and shut it down before it goes up in flames.  The access crystal is held by Overseer Athanel."
2582,"Felspark Ravine : Doom Lord Kazzak commands the Burning Legion in Outland. While we can't get to Kazzak - yet - we can and must get to his lieutenants that command Legion troops from the ground.They have stationed dreadlords in Felspark Ravine, east of here. They are responsible for these infernal storms that rain down upon our heads. To take them and their minions out would be a great set back to the Burning Legion."
2583,"Retrieving the Goods : <Audi looks around and then lowers her voice.>I'm sure Shauly told you a bit about our work here. When Jaxon and I are out in the field 'hunting,' we've been collecting pieces of the ethereal eco-dome generators and hiding them in the nests of our prey, the raptors in Eco-Dome Farfield.It's a remote area to the northeast of the Stormspire, close to the Netherstone. I don't anticipate you'll run into many ethereals there, but would you be willing to help us collect the dome generator pieces?"
2584,"Gathering the Reagents : I have a feeling that these Lost Ones may not respond well to a draenei, but would welcome an arakkoa. I can create a potion that will allow you to take on the form of an arakkoa for a short time. It requires a couple of reagents which cannot be stored and must be used within hours of being gathered.You will need to bring me a handful of sporebat eyes and some fen strider tentacles. Both species dwell in the wilderness surrounding Telredor."
2585,Behind Enemy Lines : All arrangements have been made to take you to where our spies are hiding.  Just come see me when you're ready and we'll get you on your way.
2586,"Voidwalkers Gone Wild : Even if I can get the zeppelin's frame repaired, I'll have to find something else to power the engine. I'm all out of fuel and there's no place to fill up around here!To the south of us is an area of broken land called the Warp Fields. It's full of rogue and uncontrolled voidwalkers, but I like to think of them as walking batteries.If you can bring me enough of their essence, I can convert the zeppelin's engine to run on it. Five gold says I'll even get better mileage out of it, too!"
2587,"Us or Them : In order to end the Ango'rosh threat, we must kill their leader, Overlord Gorefist. We'll do better than that, though. We'll make an example of the overlord and his followers.Go to the Ango'rosh Stronghold and deal with our foes. The stronghold is located in a cave on a small island to the northwest of Zabra'jin. You'll see a bridge made from a fallen mushroom beyond the Ango'rosh Camp.Show no mercy, <name>. They certainly wouldn't spare any of us."
2588,"Gaining the Advantage : The troops of the Shattered Sun Offensive will need every advantage they can get to beat back the allies of Kil'Jaeden. My colleagues in Stormwind have created oils which will strengthen the blades and armor of our troops.The key ingredient, nether residue, pervades Outland  -- if you know where to look. Any master herbalist, skinner, or miner who knows the signs can gather it while plying <his/her> trade. Those herbs, ores, and beasts native to Outland may all bear the residue."
2589,"Favor of the Gronn : A token in the form of a small statuette falls from Dorgok's dead clutch.  It bears a striking resemblance to one of the gronn.Surely, Commander Haephus Stonewall at Evergrove in the Ruuan Weald, up the ramp to the east, would be interested in this!"
2590,"In Search of Farahlite : To the northeast is an area called the Netherstone, a landmark not seen when this was a lush, green land. Newly-exposed crystal formations have shown us a mineral we've called farahlite in honor of this land's former identity.The tiny amount of farahlite we've mined has already proven popular with our clients. The highest grade of the mineral comes not from static deposits, but from the giants around the Netherstone. I can offer you a cut of the profits if you'll help supply the higher grade farahlite."
2591,"Master Smith Rhonsus : At last, my journeyman project is complete! I can't wait to formally present it to Master Rhonsus.<The apprentice looks at you as you describe your experiences retrieving the hammer.>They attacked you? All of them? By the Light, they've gone mad!What are we to do, <name>? It grieves me to say so, but it may be necessary to kill Master Rhonsus. It would leave me as the only smith in Kirin'Var, but I believe my training is sufficient to serve the town's needs."
2592,"Trueflight Arrows : With the influx of pilgrims and the encroachment of Alliance forces, things around Falcon Watch have gotten quite busy lately. In my spare time, I usually help prepare batches of arrows for the rangers, but I haven't had the chance to gather feathers for the fletching in a long time.I could offer you a bit of coin if you'd be willing to gather the tail feathers of the bonestripper vultures. In the past, I've found them circling the bones of large beasts to the north of Falcon Watch."
2593,"Falcon Watch : My people recently finished building Falcon Watch, a base of operations in the southwestern region of Hellfire Peninsula - beyond Hellfire Citadel.  You are welcome there as an ally, <name>.If you're looking for work, go there and tell Ranger Captain Venn'ren that I sent you.  He will see to it that you're given tasks worthy of someone of your caliber."
2594,"Waste Not, Want Not : Reinforcements are great, but I don't see 'em haulin' any wagons loaded with ingots or timber.Take a look around, friend. Trees are in short supply, and the mines are overrun with Legion scum.I'm in a bad way fer supplies, and I'm makin' what substitutions I can, but it's time to start reusing what we can.The southern edge of the Path o' Glory is strewn with the ruins of siege machinery. Some pieces of 'em are still usable. Feeling up to a bit o' a salvage operation?"
2595,"Discovering Your Roots : Greetings, <race>.I'm afraid I have little to offer here until my reagents are stocked.Of the supplies I require, there is a special reagent, razorthorn root, that is particularly difficult to harvest.Fortunately, I know a secret....Using the glands of the Razorthorn flayers, one can control a ravager there and use it to expose a root.To find the roots, travel to Outlands and fly northeast from Shattrath until you reach Razorthorn Rise."
2596,Hero's Call: Terokkar Forest! : We have lost contact with the druids of the Cenarion ThicketThe King has commanded any able bodies of the Alliance to venture into Terokkar Forest and discover what has happened.The thicket can be found by heading northwest through Terokkar Forest from Zangarmarsh.
2597,"The Missing War Party : After the last Murkblood raid, a group of younglings decided to act. We tried to stop them but the rage had taken hold. It has now been one week since we last saw our beloved younglings.Please, <race>, you must find them! They have just barely reached adolescence. How can they expect to defeat such savages?They took the road leading west out of town. Follow that road around and look for signs of our younglings.And <name>, avoid Halaa if you value your life. It is a war-zone."
2598,"Run a Diagnostic! : Wherever the Consortium establishes a presence, we bring our eco-dome technology. The fields allow us to work in a controlled and life-sustaining atmosphere since we often find ourselves in hostile environments.Netherstorm's volatile conditions and creatures have begun to destroy the equipment that sustains our domes, especially the generator east of here. I've started a diagnostic there in hopes of understanding what can be done to combat the damage. Would you collect the results and bring them to me?"
2599,"Attack on Firewing Point : We know that the blood elves of Firewing Point are working for Kael'thas and Illidan.  And from what you've told me, clearly they are using the Broken of Tuurem as smuggling go-betweens for the creation of some horrible weapon.Whatever they're up to out there, the most efficient thing that we can do right now is to thin out their numbers.The Firewing blood elves need to be taken out!  Head over to Firewing Point to the northeast and see to it."
2600,"Blessings of the Ancients : You've earned the trust of the Cenarion Expedition, <name>.  It is time you spoke to the ancients allied with our cause, Ashyen and Keleth, and asked for their blessing.Carrying the mark of an ancient will fill you with great power.  These boons will become more powerful as your renown among us increases.Go, <name>, and ask the ancients for their blessing."
2601,"A Pilgrim's Plight : That wounded pilgrim seems to be shouting something about a pack.When you encountered her, did you see a pack nearby? Hmm...She must've left it when fleeing from her attackers. The quillfang ravagers, in their ravine to the south, are known to attack solitary travelers.If she doesn't calm down, I won't be able to tend her wounds. Her stubbornness may just cost her her life.Go to Dustquill Ravine and see if you can find her campsite. I'm willing to bet she left it there."
2602,"Report to the Allerian Post : This calls for immediate action!We have someone out in the field closer to Firewing Point that I want you to speak with.  He'll have a better idea of what our next step should be.Report to Lieutenant Meridian out at the Allerian Post and apprise him of the situation.  You'll find the post to the northeast on the southern bank of the river just south of Firewing Point.Godspeed, <name>."
2603,"Before Darkness Falls : After our caravan fell prey to an attack by Shadow Council cabal cultists, scouts were sent to Shattrath to call for help.  The guards think we're safe for now, but they underestimate these madmen.I, for one, am not looking forward to having my throat slit by some cabal initiate in the middle of the night.  Do us all a favor and take the fight to them, before they come to us.You will find our attackers south of here, at Auchindoun's northern entrance."
2604,"Trial and Error : I've fashioned four wands that I believe will enhance the power of the arakkoa's crystals. Take these wands to Trogma's Claim, and try them on the ogre slaves.You'll need to find an infused crystal off of the arakkoa in the area.When you figure out which is best, come back to me."
2605,"Plants of Zangarmarsh : The lakes of Zangarmarsh are slowly being drained of their water.  We don't quite know why, but we do know that many plants species are in danger of becoming extinct.As the expedition's cataloguer, it is my job to track and identify these plants so we can better understand what's happening to them.If you'd like to help, bring me unidentified plant parts.  They can be picked right from the ground if you're an herbalist, and the indigenous creatures of the swamp may also carry plant parts on them."
2606,"The Swirling Vial : As you touch the vial, your mind is flooded with memories, not all of which are your own. The most vivid is a memory of exchanging a similar vial with someone in Shattrath, with A'dal's light shining behind you. Despite your best efforts however, you can't pinpoint when that might have been - maybe it hasn't been, and is yet to be?"
2607,"Into the Churning Gulch : Very well, I'll create this trap, but first I want something in return.There happens to be a nearby gronn that is in possession of an item that I want, but you can't face him, not yet anyway.So, you and I are going to fashion a sleeping powder from the poison of the nearby crust bursters.You'll find them in the Churning Gulch to the southwest.  Bring me a number of their glands, and be quick about it!"
2608,"The Totems of My Enemy : There is the right way to honor one's ancestors, and there is the wrong way.The Bladespire ogres carry totems with them, but they do not use them to show their respect.  Instead, they seek to use them to manipulate and control.We should steal their totems because they are unworthy!  We will then put them to better use.Go to the Bladespire Outpost to the west, just southwest of the Razor Ridge.  Slay the Bladespire mystics and crushers, and take their totems from them!"
2609,
2610,"Flora of the Eco-Domes : Just look around you, <class>! Isn't it amazing? Of course, this incredible resurgence of life is a byproduct of the ethereal domes, but imagine what it could do in the hands of the expedition.I'm preparing to negotiate with the ethereals for access to their technology, but I'd like to get a better idea of its effects on plant-based life.I've built a device to concentrate the dome's energies on the lashers in this area. Would you be so kind as to test it for me and share the results?"
2611,"Out of This World Produce! : I'll be the first to admit I'm not quite sure what this order is for, but Rocket-Chief Fuselage's instructions were very specific -- only the very best fruit, preserved to survive a long voyage and sealed against the elements.There were other specifications, zero-gravity this and low pressure that. I don't pretend to understand it, but the price is right, so he'll get his superfood. Bring this crate to him up at Area 52. After crossing into Netherstorm, keep following the road until you see the town."
2612,"Stinging the Stingers : It's impossible to work with all this infernal buzzing! Do you hear it?I can't get it out of my head! I know exactly what's making the noise, too. It's those damnable marshlight bleeders! The noise always comes from the south and west of the village.They're too big to swat, crush underfoot, or wave away. The only way to stop that unholy droning is to kill them. I don't care how you do it, <name>, just quiet them!"
2613,"Treebole Must Know : This is troubling!  The arakkoa are causing the ancients and protectors to become possessed by evil spirits!But, there is one ancient that could not possibly have been affected.  His name is Treebole, and you must go to him at once if we're to save the trees of the Raven's Wood!Go back to the Raven's Wood.  You will find him at the fork in the path just past Grishnath."
2614,"Understanding the Mok'Nathal : <Leoroxx looks you in the eye with the kind of stare that chills your soul.>You come to the Mok'Nathal, but you do not understand us.  You do not understand our struggle to survive.If you would understand us, then you will have to endure a taste of that struggle.To the south are the Vekh'nir arakkoa.  They have enslaved a group of ogres in the caverns known as Trogma's Claim and their leader, Vekh is in there.Slay him!"
2615,"Stand Tall, Captain! : Well, well, well... still alive I see. That's good, because Mor'ghor has requested your presence in his tower at once. Get a move on!"
2616,"Stinger Venom : When I speak to draenei, I often get the sense that they consider themselves removed from their environment. Many seem to pity my brethren, the Broken, who they say have lost something.We Broken may have lost our inclination toward the Light, but our experiences have brought us closer to the land.My people see opportunities where few draenei do. Take, for example, the venom of the marshlight bleeders that live to the south and west. It has a wide variety of uses from hunting to healing."
2617,Restoring the Light : Much of this region was inhabited by draenei long ago.  We Aldor were charged with the safeguarding of our holy sites and altars.  Many of them have since been destroyed or taken over by our enemies.To the east of here there is an arakkoa outpost.  It was purposefully built on the location of three of our sacred altars. The arakkoa use their foul magic to warp and defile the innate power of our shrines.Take this to the arakkoa outpost and use it to cleanse the three altars.
2618,"Warchief's Command: Zangarmarsh! : The Cenarion Circle's main expeditionary force in Outland is known as the Cenarion Expedition.  Though it began as a small venture controlled directly by the Cenarion Circle, it's become a large and fairly autonomous body.The expedition's leader, Ysiel Windsinger, has asked us to direct volunteers to her outpost.  Report to her at the Cenarion Refuge in eastern Zangarmarsh.  Take the main path to the west and it will lead you directly there."
2619,"Grimnok and Korgaah, I Am For You! : T'chali has been waiting for his revenge!The day they bury T'chali and leave him to die, it was Grimnok Battleborn that led them.  And the next day it was Korgaah that come south to raid and kick T'chali in the head.I want them dead!You will find Grimnok atop the Southmaul Tower in Bloodmaul Outpost.  You will find Korgaah in the top of a building at the north end of Bladespire Hold.  Korgaah has sober defenders, so use the brew to distract him away from them, because they won't drink."
2620,"Reunion : So you come from the world beyond the Portal? And you know of Rexxar. Oh yes, I am quite familiar with him.You see, he is my son.But he made his choice a lifetime ago. He is not one of us, and he is not welcome here. We have enough troubles with the Bloodmaul ogres.Know this: being born a half-breed does not make you Mok'Nathal."
2621,"The Truth Unorbed : This strange, magical orb drops from beneath the contour feathers of the arakkoa.Suffused with an eerie, purple glow, the orb pulses to an unheard beat.  Holding it makes you mildly uncomfortable, and so you quickly place it within your pack.Perhaps Tree Warden Chawn at Ruuan Weald to the west, through the tunnel and across the Wyrmskull Bridge, would be interested in examining it?"
2622,"Intercepting the Mana Cells : I have devised a plan to acquire a power source strong enough for the creation of our portal.The ethereal forces at Bash'ir Landing, atop the northwestern Blade's Edge Mountains, have been smuggling mana cells out of Tempest Keep and transporting them to the Sunwell for Kael'thas.They have hidden the cells, but there is a way for you to find them; the ethereal carry phase devices that you can use to see the smuggled goods.Just beware the mana cells' phase wyrm guardians."
2623,"Troublesome Distractions : Your former employer, Wind Trader Marid, must've gotten wind that you're helping us now. Through my projection, I've seen his nether-stalkers entering the area, hoping to track us down.We've been able evade them so far, but Marid must be dealt with before the problem grows more severe.If your impressions of Marid are correct, he'll do just about anything to secure the supply of his product. Return to him and tell him you're prepared to offer a deal. Lure him away and slay him."
2624,"Leader of the Darkcrest : A bounty is hereby declared by the Cenarion Expedition on Rajah Haghazed, leader of the Darkcrest naga.  Haghazed was last sighted by Cenarion scouts at the Lagoon, in the central southern region of Zangarmarsh.The Darkcrest have been linked to numerous attacks against the Cenarion Expedition and their leader is considered extremely dangerous.Those seeking to claim the bounty are advised to report to Warden Hamoot."
2625,"Olemba Seed Oil : The oily seeds from the forest's olemba trees could prove very valuable. I'd like to gather a larger quantity of them, press them for their oil, and then see what I can do with it.Just think, there's a whole forest full of trees out there, producing a lot of seeds that go to waste. I don't care if it turns out to be cooking oil, lamp oil, or weapon oil, I won't let it go to waste!Bring me any of the seeds that you happen to gather from the olemba cones. They're all over the place."
2626,"What Happens in Terokkar Stays in Terokkar : If word reaches Thrallmar that they've failed to contain the fel orcs, we're going to be receiving a lot of company down here. Frankly, I'm not sure I want all that attention, so we're going to keep this little problem under wraps, got it?If we can inflict enough casualties on the fel orcs, chances are their presence will never come to the attention of anyone outside Stonebreaker. So, let's end it now.Wade in there, swing your weapon, wave your hands, or whatever it is you do - just kill fel orcs."
2627,"Preparing the Salve : Just as Zeth'Gor came into view, a Legion patrol caught sight of me. I ran, hoping to duck into one of the towers in the distance, but one of their felhounds caught up with me and nearly hamstrung me!I managed to escape, but my leg is in terrible shape. Stone Guard Ambelan found me and brought me here.Now, I have to find a way to tend to my leg. Spineleaf grows in and around the Valley of Bones to the north . A salve made from it will dull the pain enough for me to travel."
2628,"The Rock Flayer Matriarch : Rock flayers are mean, nasty, violent creatures.  But the plain ones are like tame beasts when compared to their matriarch, Blacktalon the Savage.My cousin got eaten by her and it wasn't pretty.  I swore that one day Blacktalon would pay for that.  You bring back proof of that monster's death and I will give you my life's savings.  Deal?You're going to need some friends to kill Blacktalon.  Big tough friends with sharp swords.  You'll find her inside a cave in the Great Fissure.  Good luck!"
2629,"They Stole Me Hookah and Me Brews! : T'chali used to be a pretty friendly troll.  Me come down here to teach the Bloodmaul how to brew their beer.  But once me do that, the Bloodmaul bury T'chali and leave him here to rot!The worst part of it was that they stole me hookah!So, you want to help T'chali?  You bring me hookah back.  T'chali think the ogres that stole it headed southwest over by the mine.And while you're in there, pick up some brews, too!"
2630,"More than a Pound of Flesh : <name>, I've got something else for you to do.  One of the eggheads wants to study the fiendling flesh beasts that can be found at Razaan's Landing, north of the Razor Ridge.More to the point, they want to study the flesh of the flesh beasts that are there.<Dizzy makes a disgusted face.>But, of course, they aren't willing to get their hands dirty, and they only want the ether-energized flesh, which it's not likely that all of them have.I say, beggars can't be choosers, but what can you do?"
2631,"Journey to Thrallmar : When you're ready, I'll summon a wyvern to fly you to Thrallmar. Once you arrive, deliver Orion's report to General Krakork.Lok'tar ogar, <name> - good luck."
2632,"Murkblood Leaders... : We have lost many friends in recent weeks.For decades we have dealt with the ogres of Nagrand but now a new threat has arisen. The Broken tribe of Murkblood attacked our fishing village to the southwest, Sunspring Post, and managed to kill or evict all of the orcs that inhabited the town.While the others feel that the best course of action is to kill indiscriminately, I know that we must destroy their leadership. I do not know who their leader is but I suspect that you will know when you find him."
2633,"The Fate of Tuurem : Prophet Velen's search for allies has emboldened those draenei remaining in Outland to begin a search of their own. The Legion's war on my people drove us from our cities and temples, but they have not destroyed the traces of our civilization.Tuurem, my former home in the Terokkar Forest, was one of the first cities overrun by the orcs. It's been too long since I've received news of its status. Take this letter to Andarl in the Allerian Stronghold within Terokkar and see what you can find out."
2634,The Horrors of Pollution : You carefully fill a vial with the fallen void horror's ooze.Researcher Navuud at the Protectorate Watch Post would be quite interested in such a find! Take it to him at once!
2635,"The Road to Falcon Watch : <The battered blood elf's face displays relief at your presence.>Please, <class>, get me out of this cage! I foolishly set out from Thrallmar ahead of the main group, despite Martik Tor'seldori's warnings.I was set upon by horrible creatures that could only be the ravagers he talked about. I managed to drive them off, but that was only the beginning of my troubles.As I bound my wounds, those bird men found me, dragged me back to this cave, and locked me in this cage! I must get to Falcon Watch!"
2636,"Magic of the Arakkoa : Outland holds many secrets, <name>.  It's only a matter of time before we uncover them all.The half-bird, half-man species of the arakkoa possesses ancient arcane knowledge that would aid us greatly in our exploration of this world.  Travel to the Den of Haal'esh, south of here.  Obtain any magical scrolls that the Haal'eshi might be carrying on them and bring them to me."
2637,"The Path of Glory : The 'Path of Glory,' they called it. A road leading from the heart of their gruesome fortress to the Dark Portal, paved with the bones of my people.It wasn't enough for them to hunt us down like animals, destroy our cities, and torture those who survived. No, they had to use our bones as paving stones, denying my brethren a proper burial under the Light.Those tortured souls still wander these lands, crying out for release. I ask you, <name>, help me in this undertaking."
2638,"An Old Gift : <The priest's gaze slowly moves from his mug to you.>Don't you know better than to bother a man in his cups?Oh, what's the use? I suppose newcomers are a good sign. What would Turalyon think?I remember the eve of our departure, when I gave Mysteries of the Light to him. During the campaign and the ensuing years, he never forgot to read his daily passage to the men.When he left us again, he gave the book back to me. Like a fool, I believed it safe in my quarters to the south of the armory."
2639,"Vile Plans : The text on the note is written in some dark, indecipherable scrawl. The more you stare at them, the more the symbols seem to twist and burn before your eyes. There is only one in Thrallmar that can transcribe such vile script - the blood elf Magister Bloodhawk."
2640,"Banish More Demons : If we know the demons, and we do because we've studied them extensively, they're fast at work repairing any damage that has been done to their precious transporter.So, if you want a chance at another darkrune, take our banishing crystal back out there and eliminate more demons.  Besides, you want to help us to lessen the threat that the demons pose, yes?We said ""chance"" because the process we use yields mixed results.  You might get a darkrune, or you might get something else entirely."
2641,Attack on Manaforge Coruu : Your success at Manaforge B'naar was quite noteworthy.  I'm sure that Anchorite Karja will ask you for a repeat performance at Manaforge Coruu next.We've learned of a particularly important regiment of Sunfury arcanists and researchers being deployed there and I would like you to target them.  Succeed and you will deliver a crushing blow against our enemy's forces.
2642,
2643,"Warden Hamoot : Before you leave Cenarion Refuge, make sure you speak with Warden Hamoot.  He's in charge of the expedition's security.He would never forgive me if I didn't send a seasoned adventurer like you his way."
2644,
2645,"Trial of the Naaru: Tenacity : Four trials you must pass before you are deemed worthy by the naaru.In our travels we have encountered many dangerous beings. Some of these beings we incarcerated and placed in what is now known as the Arcatraz of Tempest Keep.There is one prisoner, however, that is a victim of circumstance. A stowaway who was in the wrong naaru vessel at the wrong time.Venture to the Arcatraz and rescue the gnome, Millhouse Manastorm. Ensure his survival."
2646,"Make Them Listen : I was sent here to make contact with the Unyielding spirits.  These once proud Alliance soldiers were defeated long ago, and now their cursed spirits haunt the ruins to the west.  If they would only join us we would gain a powerful ally.  Imagine, a legion of undying warriors to use against our enemies.  But these undead are mad with hatred and will not listen to me.  Perhaps they can be forced to join us."
2647,"Apothecary Zelana : Apethecary Zelana has been studying the beasts of Hellfire Peninsula in the field.  She wants a sample of the blood you gathered; with luck, she might discover what turned those Bonechewer bastards' skins red!Zelana is at Reaver's Fall, southeast of Thrallmar.  Follow the road east and when you see a destroyed, green-glowing hunk of metal, you're there.  She has a camp set up behind the wyverns."
2648,"Trollbane is Looking for You : While we were busy, a messenger was waiting out in the hall.  I suppose he grew tired, or perhaps he simply ran away at the sight of Jules floating around the room.Either way, Force Commander Danath is looking for you.  I suggest that you seek an audience with him inside the barracks as quickly as possible!"
2649,"WANTED: Uvuros, Scourge of Shadowmoon : Wanted - DEAD:Uvuros, scourge of Shadowmoon Valley.By order of Overlord Or'barokh, the fel beast, Uvuros, is to be killed on sight and his mane stripped from his carcass as proof of deed. Return the fiery mane of the beast to Warcaller Sardon Truslice should you succeed.Uvuros was last seen at the Hand of Gul'dan, located in the heart of Shadowmoon Valley - east of Shadowmoon Village."

Gordawg knows where this earth has been.<Gordawg raises one of his massive legs and stomps the ground.>Look. See Nagrand.<Gordawg directs you to the imprint of his foot. Within the imprint you see what appears to be a perfect geological map of Nagrand, marked with the locations of where you can find the elementals Gordawg wants you to destroy.>BREAK THEM! Bring Gordawg the pieces to eat.Take the map."
2651,"Burstcap Mushrooms, Mon! : You like mushrooms, mon? There be a powerful one here in Zangarmarsh, growin' real close to Zabra'jin.You gotta be careful, though, mon. They be callin' it the burstcap for a reason. If you be gettin' too close without takin' the proper precautions, it'll blow right up on you! Poof! Right into a cloud o' toxic spores.I been usin' them for readin' the omens, but they be almost gone now."
2652,"Speak with Private Weeks : A report's just come in from one of our scouts near Grangol'var Village.  He says that a shadowy band has moved into the ruins there.<name>, I want you to speak with Private Weeks and see how you can assist him to figure out what this unknown group is up to.  Just head west past Stonebreaker Hold.  His last report puts his position near the north entrance to the village."
2653,"Baron Sablemane Has Requested Your Presence : <name>, while you were out being one hell of a <class>, Baron Sablemane sent his pet dragon up here with a message.He's asked for you personally.  From what I understand, he wants you to head up his own fight against the gronn.I guess you're the most qualified person in all of Outland to help him, but if I were you, I'd get in contact with a couple of friends first and ask them to join you at the Circle of Blood."
2654,"Longtail is the Lynchpin : With the Blackwing wyrmcultists massing in the tunnel, we're hard pressed to deal with the situation.  Quite frankly, they have the numbers.And while we've been able to take care of any of their people that get too close, the fact remains that if they attack in earnest, we're going to be overrun.The situation calls for someone to get through to the other end of the tunnel, and take out their leader, Draaca Longtail.  Up for some fun?"
2655,
2656,"Warn Area 52! : <name>, you have to get word back to Area 52 immediately!  Hurry!Tell the rocket-chief that the Burning Legion is after us now!"
2657,"Naaru Technology : The Scryers obtained a personnel roster for Manaforge B'naar and are now having a field day picking out assassination targets.They've missed one small bit of information, scribbled on the side of the roster.  It appeared to be a password or code like those used to access naaru-made technology like the Exodar or Tempest Keep.Go inside the manaforge and look for a control panel.  Copy its readouts on this scroll as well as you can.  We must confirm our suspicions about the origin of the technology."
2658,"Visions of Destruction : A vision of cataclysm often disturbs my rest -- a rain of green fire falling to the earth, felling the valiant defenders of a mighty fortress. It has haunted me for weeks now, although I have only recently come to understand its meaning.To the far east, in Shadowmoon Valley, the Wildhammer dwarves endure constant attacks from the Burning Legion and numerous other foes. They fight bravely, but without relief, their enemies will triumph. Go to their side, <name>. Help them in their fight."
2659,"Formal Introductions : Greetings, <name>. Do not be alarmed. This is merely a projection of my current form. It's the only way my companion and I could keep watch without revealing ourselves.The ethereal who approached you, Marid, is little better than a swindler in the guise of a legitimate merchant. I'd like you to consider working with me instead. My purpose out here is to find out more about the unusual dragonkin on this ridge. Meet me at the north end of the ridge and we will discuss this further."
2660,"Keeping Up Appearances : The ethereals are clever and very observant, so it's no accident that I'm here posing as a simple furrier. In fact, I've been sent from Area 52 to appraise the technology the ethereals use to generate their eco-domes.I'd like to enlist your help, <class>. We've been asked to use non-goblin agents whenever possible.What I want you to do is bring me a number of ripfang lynx pelts in the guise of a hunter. You can find the lynxes all over Eco-Dome Midrealm."
2661,"Escaping the Tomb : I appreciate your help, <name>.  I was certain I was going to be killed.Let's get out of here with a hurry.  It won't be long before more cultists come after us."
2662,"The Temple of Telhamat : Fortunately, the Path of Glory is not the only trace of my people in these lands. To the west, a few of our holy sites survive, although some have been overrun.While Velen prepared for the journey that would lead him to Azeroth, those of us who would remain behind sought to reestablish a presence at our holy places.In the western part of the Hellfire Peninsula, you will find a small group of draenei at the Temple of Telhamat, led by Amaan the Wise. I am certain he'd be interested in meeting you."
2663,"Dealing with the Overmaster : I used to be the foreman here.  But now that I've been demoted, I've come to realize our pilgrimage from Quel'Thalas to Outland was all a lie.A lie perpetrated by Kael'thas to strengthen his forces here in the Netherstorm.I've tried to convince my brethren that we should leave, especially with the Burning Legion here, but they are all too stubborn.Do me a favor?  Kill Overmaster Grindgarr.  Then return to your ethereal and tell him that I am no longer his enemy."
2664,"The Finest Down : The arakkoa at the Den of Haal'esh, south of here, breed a magnificent species of birds called kaliri.  Their feathers would fetch a bundle at the trading posts back in Azeroth.  Just think of all the ale I could buy then!Tell you what, you bring me a stack of kaliri feathers and I'll give you my very own hat.  What do you say?  You'll never find a hat like this one!  Do we have a deal?"
2665,
2666,"Message to the Daggerfen : Of all the Lost One tribes in Zangarmarsh, the Daggerfen are the most cunning and most aggressive. They are highly organized and make no secret of the fact that they desire control over the other Lost Ones in the marsh.Their attacks have already taken quite a toll on my scouts and messengers. I cannot afford to lose any more men.If we don't act soon, they'll have complete control over the roads and Zabra'jin will effectively be surrounded."
2667,"The Dreghood Elders : The Dreghood spirit is broken because our elders are imprisoned.  Take this key and go downstairs to free them.They are Morod the Windstirrer, Akoru the Firecaller and Aylaan the Waterwaker.  Once they are free, the spirits will return to the Dreghood tribe."
2668,"Harvesting the Fel Ammunition : We must shut down the Burning Legion's access to Death's Door, but first you're going to destroy their two warp-gates!The problem is, we can't even scratch one of those things, so you're going to need to use their own weapons against them.The death's might, death's watch, deathforge over-smiths and deathforge technicians carry the ammunition for the fel cannons.Normally it wouldn't affect any of them, but if you bring the cannonballs to me, I will imbue them with Nature's unbridled wrath!"
2669,"Dealing with the Foreman : The blood elves call the mine underneath Manaforge Ara the Trelleum Mine.  Ever since they lost the one underneath Manaforge Ultris, this is where their sole supply of material for running the forges is coming from.Needless to say, it would be a boon for us to cripple their mining operation.  Perhaps we'd even be able to move in and take it over for ourselves?Whatever the case, I want you to go in there and deal with Foreman Sundown.  The mine is around the back of the island to the left."
2670,"Where Are My Keys? : I can't find my keys -- I suspect my evil twin is at fault. ""Take care"" of him for me, <name>."
2671,"The Legion Reborn : While the Burning Legion invaded Azeroth, they were also at work here, in Outland.  We have tracked their movements over the years, but this latest activity, <class> - well, this is beyond anything we've seen.Seek out Sergeant Altumus near the eastern supply caravan. She has been monitoring the invaders and may have insights into their purpose.Be swift - and take care, <name> - the Burning Legion is not to be underestimated."
2672,"Test Flight: The Zephyrium Capacitorium : I built an amazing device, the Zephyrium Capacitorium, and I'm sure it'll work perfectly, but... do you want to help me test it?There's plenty of hazard pay!Speak with my twin over there, Rally. Good luck, <name>. Come back after your experiment.  Or... if that's not possible due to sustained injuries, your next of kin can report to collect your pay."
2673,"From the Ashes : If you follow the road east and up the side of the mountain, then turn north, you will come to my long lost home.Once there was a wood there. Its name is forgotten. Long ago the Burning Legion summoned scorched imps and other creatures of flame. My home was destroyed and my people fled. Now only I remain. I have saved some ironroot seeds that could be planted in fertile volcanic soil. Their magic is strong. Do this for me and I will share with you the treasures of a forgotten age."
2674,"The Apprentice's Request : As an apprentice wind rider master, one of my tasks is to care for the beasts when they're not flying. The problem is that we have so few here, there's very little downtime for any of them.I'm afraid we'll work them all to death if we don't receive any replacements. There's a large stable down in Shadowmoon Village, in western Shadowmoon Valley. Dama Wildmane oversees the wind rider care and training there.Would you speak with her on our behalf and let her know about our situation?"
2675,"Deadly Predators : The Broken that live in Outland have endured endless violence.  It is of little surprise that as soon as the Dark Portal opened they flocked to it in droves with hopes of escaping this land.Unfortunately for our confused brothers and sisters coming from the south, the rock flayers that inhabit the Great Fissure see them as easy prey.  Go there and thin the rock flayer population, so that our kin might have a chance."
2676,"Marks of Sargeras : By now it should be clear to you why we oppose the Burning Legion and those who serve them.If you wish to prove yourself to the Aldor, bring me the insignias of high-ranking Legion and their Shadow Council followers.  The highest-ranking Legion can be found in Netherstorm and Shadowmoon Valley."
2677,"Helping the Cenarion Post : The Cenarion Circle has sent an expedition to Outland and, as I understand it, they are here to study what has happened and to help reverse any damage that they can.They've setup a little post just to the west on the south side of the road leading to Zangarmarsh.If you hit Thornfang Hill, you've gone too far.Would you please go and see how you might help them?  Speak with Thiah Redmane as she is the one that sent the request to us for assistance."
2678,"The Deathforge : While you were taking care of the infernals at Legion Hold, I've been going over your reports. We've got no reason to believe the Legion lied about what's going on at the Deathforge. They're really cranking out infernals down there, so I've dispatched a scouting party to keep watch over it.If we don't shut down the Deathforge, they'll rebuild the infernal stockpile that you destroyed at Legion Hold.Report to Scout Zagran atop Slag Watch, to the southeast of here and overlooking the Deathforge."
2679,"Mark V is Alive! : Greetings, <race>.  I am charged up and fully functional.There are fragile draenei machines in these ruins, which I must retrieve.  I am equipped with delicate servos in my wrist actuators, and the latest in combustion-pneumatic bump soakers.  Handling them with care will not be an issue.However, the ghosts that haunt these ruins will likely attack, so I will need you and your friends along for protection."
2680,"Learning to Fly : Though it may end up hurting my business in the long run, you look the sort that dreams of flying <his/her> own mount through the skies, rather than being flown from place to place.I understand the feeling completely.You, my friend, need to head to Shadowmoon Village in the northwest corner of Shadowmoon Valley. When you get there, speak with Olrokk about some flight instruction. Mind you, his training's not cheap. But, I think that you'll find it worth your while."
2681,
2682,"Diaphanous Wings : Living in such a remote location has taught us to make use of everything available. Of course, you have to learn to stop thinking about where some of these materials come from first.I've found that the wings of the umbraglow stingers are very helpful for waterproofing. They're strong, thin, and flexible.<Haalrun chuckles.>I see the look on your face. Like I said, it takes time to get used to the idea. If you're going to be out and about, would you mind bringing me some of the wings?"
2683,
2684,"Bloody Vengeance : East of here is an old destroyed Alliance siege tower.  Now scavengers loot it for old nails and bits of scrap.  Long ago, many Alliance warriors lost their lives at this tower and their banner was captured by Urtrak, a foul orc commander.Blow the Unyielding battle horn near the Alliance banner.  This will get the attention of Urtrak.  It may also summon forth warriors who fell in battle long ago."
2685,"Mystery Mask : Ok, it should work now. What is it, you ask? Why, it's a communication device - it allows those blockheads to communicate with each other. You know, the Burning Legion! I would suggest that you hand this mask to Wildlord Antelarion. He's over there pacing around. Always moving, he is.Well get moving, he's been trying to get his hands on one of these for sometime now."
2686,"Since Time Forgotten... : Since time forgotten we have fought with the Bladespire ogres.We have managed to push them back so that now they only hold a tenuous grip at Bladespire Outpost.  It's back the way that you came, on the southwestern edge of the Razor Ridge.Prove your worth to me by killing their leader, Gnosh Brognat.Let us see what stuff you are made of when fighting the ogres."
2687,"Felspine the Greater : Gnomus knows about the massive diemetradon and plans to eat it! He must have been able to see what I could see through the eyes of his arcano-scorp. Look, there's no time to explain. He's crazy and that craziness is going to cost us the closest thing we've got to a fireproof jumpsuit.Get back to the lava flow near Baa'ri and track down Felspine the Greater. Once you find it, kill it and bring me back its hide.Don't try and reason with me, <name>. I'm well past that point."
2688,"Stealth Flight : While you were gone, my men uncovered another one of these manaforges.  It is east of here and is known as Manaforge Coruu.Two of my best spies have arranged a secret landing spot outside of the manaforge.  You are to help them infiltrate Kael's forces and obtain whatever information you can.Speak to Veronia just outside the city walls; she's arranged for a windrider that will take you to Manaforge Coruu.  Once there, speak to Caledis Brightdawn; he will brief you on your mission."
2689,"Umbrafen Eel Filets : It's good to see another fresh face here. When Haalrun and I first came to Telredor, we were the only outsiders, but that seems like a lifetime ago.Still, we try to welcome newcomers and ensure that there's always enough food and supplies. We can never fully repay the kindness of the Telredor anchorites, but we can follow their example and extend it to others.If you would like to help, the nearby lakes are populated with a fish called the Umbrafen eel, whose meat is a staple of our diet."
2690,"Timber Worg Tails : Have you come across the timber worgs in your travels? I've had the opportunity to observe them while mapping some of the northern reaches of the forest. I wouldn't recommend getting close to them unless you're prepared for combat.They have no fear of us and won't hesitate to defend their territory.It's fitting that such a creature would have a magnificent tail. I've been trying to collect enough of them to trim a new cloak, but the worgs have a habit of evading my snares. Will you help?"
2691,"Leader of the Bloodscale : A bounty is hereby declared by the Cenarion Expedition on Rajis Fyashe, leader of the Bloodscale naga.  The naga sorceress was last sighted at Serpent Lake, in the northern region of Zangarmarsh.The Bloodscale are to be considered extremely dangerous and their leader is to be approached with extreme caution.Those seeking to claim the bounty are advised to report to Warden Hamoot at Cenarion Refuge."
2692,"Report to Zurai : With the arrival of Field Commander Romus and his forces, the Alliance and their draenei friends have grown bold. They're militarizing every old draenei ruin from here to Shattrath.In response, the trolls have established a new outpost in the eastern part of Zangarmarsh, just south of the Dead Mire. Swamprat Post, they're calling it. I'm glad they have a sense of humor about living in a place like that, because I wouldn't relish it.The post's commander has asked me to send anyone I can spare."
2693,"Voren'thal the Seer : Now that you've chosen a side, <name>, you should meet the Scryers' leader.You will find Voren'thal the Seer inside the Seer's Library at the Scryer's Tier.See if you can be of assistance to him.  He will be glad to hear you've decided to lend them a hand."
2694,"Test Flight: Razaan's Landing : <name>, I raised the efficiency of the Zephyrium Capacitorium by 30 percent.  That will launch a test subject of your weight and wind drag ratio to new heights!  Want to test my theory?  This experiment ought to send you near Razaan's Landing.Speak with Rally... he'll get you prepared for launch."
2695,"Entry Into the Citadel : This freshly cast mold was to be used to create a key of some sort.  From the image engraved on its back, it appears to be related to Hellfire Citadel.Maybe this could prove to interest to Danath, the force commander at Honor Hold."
2696,"Warchief's Command: Blade's Edge Mountains! : The Warchief is calling for champions to put an end to the ogre threat in Blade's Edge Mountains. Make your way north into the mountains, to the orcish stronghold of Thunderlord Stronghold and let Gor'drek know of our plight. Any help he can spare would be most welcome."
2697,"That Little Extra Kick : So, I'm just missing the one ingredient that'll give my concoction that little extra kick that it needs.The sting of the nether rays, roaming around near the shaleskin flayers, delivers quite a punch.  Bring me some of their stingers and I'll extract the venom right out of them!I'm certain the results will be explosive!"
2698,
2699,
2700,"Countdown to Doom : This almanac presages the return of Terokk, the most powerful and terrible Skettis king in arakkoa history.I always believed this to be the mere legend, <name>.  The return of the talonpriests and your recovery of this tome indicate otherwise.With each day, Terokk comes closer to returning to full strength.  Your only chance is to bring him to our world prematurely.  Return to Skettis and speak to Adaris about this.  Let us hope he has the wisdom to do the right thing."
2701,"Slaughter at Boulder'mok : I know that Rexxar has plans for you to head to Boulder'mok.  I have something that I want you to do while you are there.We must take any chance we can get to strike down the ogres of these mountains, or they will overrun us, and all that we have bled and died for will be for nothing!Boulder'mok lies far to the northwest.  Travel north to Ruuan Weald, and from there head west through the tunnel and past the Raven's Wood.<name>, I want you to kill the Bladespire ogres of Boulder'mok.  Wipe them out!"
2702,"Warchief's Command: Shadowmoon Valley! : All able-bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Blood Guard Gulmok at Shadowmoon Valley in Outland.  The Burning Legion is attempting to lay siege to Shadowmoon Village, but our elite Kor'kron force is showing them what it means to fight against the Horde.  Crush the Legion.  For the Horde!"
2703,"Deal With the Saboteurs : In searching the area for clues about the damage to our equipment, I've seen pieces of the shield generators at the bottom of the small lake to the north. I'm not sure why the crocolisks have taken an interest in the equipment, but we have to put a stop to this problem.The Consortium is quite clear on this matter. If it comes down to a choice between the equipment and crocolisks, the animals will have to go. I'll make it worth your while to deal with them."
2704,"Testing the Prototype : I've been working on a portable generator repair kit for use in some of the harsher climates that the Consortium operates in. Granted, it wasn't designed for Netherstorm, but we shouldn't have any problems with it.I had already scheduled a test with one of my best techs up at Eco-Dome Farfield beyond the Netherstone to the northeast. Take this prototype to Tashar. He'll know what to do with it. If it works, we can use it to reinforce the shield generators at the larger domes."
2705,"Impending Attack : The position of the ogres' mushroom-cutting operation can't be an accident. I can't escape the suspicion that they're preparing for an attack on Zabra'jin.I must know for certain, <name>. The ogres have another outpost to the northwest, the Ango'rosh Grounds. If they're staging for an attack, there will be evidence of their plans there. Go there, <name> and search the camp for signs of their intentions. Return to me with anything that might be suspicious."
2706,"Makuru's Vengeance : Sedai was like a brother to Makuru.   We owe him our lives and more!  They call Makuru crazy but if the Omenai are not going to do anything about his death then they're the crazy ones!Makuru doesn't have much to call his own in this world, but he will give you his only possession if you avenge Sedai.  I've seen the brown orc Mag'har grunts before, up in the hills to the northeast.  They hate us!  They don't deserve our mercy!  Go, avenge Sedai!  Bring me their ancestral beads as proof!"
2707,"The Mastermind : Those infernal gan'arg keep scurrying into the mine! For each one you kill, two or three more seem to take its place!There's got to be someone down there in the deepest reaches of the mine directing the incursion. You seemed to do well against them last time, and Light knows you're the only one brave enough to venture back into the mine. Find out who's responsible for this disturbance and make him pay!"
2708,"Little Embers : Northeast of here, on the plateau above us lies the burnt ashes of my ancient home. A great wood flourished there before the Burning Legion sent their imps to burn us away. So many died that even centuries later my tired old heart hungers for revenge. There are too many of them for us to ever reclaim the land, but you could make them afraid.Surely you will help me?"
2709,"Dumphry's Request : Fel orcs might be complete barbarians but their smithing is not as primitive as you might think.  Only fel iron can be used with this mold if we want to end up with a working key - anything else would probably end up breaking it.Bring me some fel iron bars, a bit of arcane dust and motes of fire.  I'll try my hand at it, but I make no promises."
2710,"Too Many Mouths to Feed : On my last hunting trip, I caught sight of a new outpost being built by a group of trolls. No doubt they've begun hunting these lands, too.If they establish a permanent presence out here, the competition for food will be fierce. We cannot take direct action against them without provocation, but we can remove some of the natural competition for food.For each mire hydra you kill, that's three fewer mouths to feed!"
2711,
2712,"Return to Obadei : With Sedai's death confirmed, you're left with the unpleasant task of returning to Obadei with the grim news."
2713,"The Cenarion Expedition : The Cenarion Circle's main expeditionary force in Outland is known as the Cenarion Expedition.  Though it began as a small venture controlled directly by the Cenarion Circle, it's become a large and fairly autonomous body.The expedition's leader, Ysiel Windsinger, has asked us to direct volunteers to her outpost.  Report to her at the Cenarion Refuge in eastern Zangarmarsh.  Take the main path to the west and it will lead you directly there."
2714,"A Date with Dorgok : Good, I've seen you around and I've been meaning to speak to you about a matter of some importance.There are reports coming in that for some reason the Bloodmaul ogres are planning an offensive against Sylvanaar and Ruuan Weald.  We don't know who or what is pushing them to do this, but I intend to nip their plan in the bud!Bloodmaul Camp is where the attacks are to be staged from.  Head northwest down the ramp out of the Ruuan Weald and you will find it.  I want you to kill their leader, Dorgok!"
2715,"Gorr'Dim, Your Time Has Come... : The leader of Bladespire Hold is known as Gorr'Dim.  Trust me... the name is appropriate.Still, I wouldn't underestimate him.  He's crafty enough to have elevated his clan to be the favorite of Gruul the Dragonkiller and they now dominate these mountains.  And Gorr'Dim keeps an entourage about him at all times, including defenders who are sworn not to drink the Bloodmaul brew.For the safety of Sylvanaar, I'm asking that you go back in there and deal with him."
2716,"The Main Course! : Long story short, I used to work with a blood elf named Tiorus. My partnership with Tiorus dissolved once I got into gourmet living. He decided to take it upon himself to continue our research using MY inventions. Anyhow, he had some of his Horde goons using my arcano-scorp probes at the Ruins of Baa'ri lava flow and discovered the mother of all diemetradons!I need you to get there before he does and kill the diemetradon, Felspine, and bring his hide back to me.Hurry up!"
2717,"A Grunt's Work... : All Horde forces in this region have been dispatched to handle the attacks from the Burning Legion. This means that we are short-handed for grunt work.Our supply caravans are in constant danger from the wildlife of the region. We can't veer 15 feet off the road without running into a chimaera, felboar, or abnormally large scorpion.Get out there and clear Shadowmoon Valley of its sadistic wildlife! Just kill 'em all!"
2718,
2719,"Buying Time : As long as the transporters stand, nothing we do to the forge camps will have any permanence. We must find a way to destroy the Legion structures.I need time to devise a plan of attack. If you can keep their engineers and tinkerers busy, it would greatly slow down their progress, buying me the time I need.Stay as far away as possible from the overseers, <name>. They are extremely dangerous beings."
2720,
2721,"An Unseen Hand : The writing on the plans is far too delicate and precise to have come from any of the fel orcs. You can't make out what the text says, but the implications are pretty clear: the fel orcs are taking orders from the blood elves at Firewing Point.Why would the two forces be working together? Rokag might have some insight into this odd alliance. You decide to make your way back to Stonebreaker Hold and show him the map."
2722,"Secrets of the Arakkoa : Out here on the frontier we have to deal with the arakkoa every day.  They strike at us when they please, raiding our supply lines and killing our scouts.  Yet we know very little about these enigmatic creatures.  I have received news that northwest of here in Shattrath City there are arakkoa who are not hostile.  They might be willing to share the secrets of their race.  Rilak the Redeemed is their leader.  He resides in the northern part of the Lower City."
2723,"Ruuan Weald : The information you have helped me reveal about the nature of the arakkoa here will be of great interest to another.We were visited by members of the Cenarion Expedition, who have also become concerned with the arakkoa's intentions here in the Blade's Edge Mountains.You should seek him out. His name is Timeon, and you will find him at Evergrove in Ruuan Weald. Follow the road west from here, then north when it forks in Razor Ridge. Finally, follow the road west when it splits in the Bladed Gulch."
2724,"Naladu : Perhaps not all hope is lost for the Dreghood.  I am one of four elders that guided this tribe before we were enslaved by the Illidari.  I thought the others were dead, but I've slowly learned that at least two others are alive - chained down and powerless just as I am.I've not yet been able to find Naladu and fear for the worst.  There are more huts in the ruins upstairs; perhaps you could look for him.  It would be a great boon for our tribe if all our elders were alive."
2725,"Blood Elf + Giant = ??? : At the southern end of the Path of Conquest, near a stationary caravan, I discovered what looked like a meeting between a giant and a blood elf chancellor. What are giants even doing here? Something is just not right about all of this, grunt.I want you to fight your way to this meeting and break up the party. Recover whatever you can from the scene and then call for one of us with the flare gun."
2726,
2727,"Fel Orc Plans : The writing on the plans is far too delicate and precise to have come from any of the fel orcs. You can't make out what the text says, but the implications are pretty clear: the fel orcs are taking orders from the blood elves at Firewing Point.Why would the two forces be working together? Bertelm might have some insight into this odd alliance. You decide to make your way back to the Allerian Stronghold and show him the map."
2728,"Fel Reavers, No Thanks! : Ah, yes - the fel reaver!  Certainly the Legion's most terrible mechanical creation.  There are no less than three of these abominations aimed at the Stormspire.Fortunately for us, they are not active yet.  This affords us the possibility of dealing with them through sabotage instead of brute force.Obtain condensed nether gas from the gan'arg at Forge Base: Oblivion and fill a nearby fel reaver's fuel tank with it.  I've a feeling its engine won't handle it too well."
2729,
2730,"WANTED: Blacktalon the Savage : By order of the Ranger Captain, a reward is hereby offered for the slaying of the vicious rockflayer matriarch known as Blacktalon the Savage.Blacktalon was last sighted inside a cave in the Great Fissure.  Individuals seeking the reward are to present the creature's claws as proof of the deed."
2731,"Chief Apothecary Hildagard : The history of Shadowmoon Valley is a long and troubled one. Few study it for fear of breathing new life into the unspeakable atrocities that took place there.Not all are so timid, though. Chief Apothecary Hildagard's research delves into the ghosts of Shadowmoon's past. It is a staggering undertaking, one with which she would welcome help, I'm sure.If your travels bring you there, seek Hildagard at Shadowmoon Village, in the northwestern reaches of the valley."
2732,"The Bloodmaul Ogres : To the south of the Bladespire clan lies yet another threat:  Bloodmaul Outpost.While the Bloodmaul ogres are not the strongest clan in the mountains, not having the favor of the gronn known as Gruul the Dragonkiller, they run a close second.Now that we've dealt with winnowing the Bladespire, it is time to turn our eye upon their rivals.From Bladespire Hold head south through the ravine until you come to Bloodmaul Outpost.  Slay as many of the Bloodmaul ogres in the vicinity as you can."
2733,"Even Gronn Have Standards : Are you familiar with Shattrath City, <class>?  Above it to the northwest is a place called the Barrier Hills, which you can only get to upon a flying mount.One of Gruul's sons, Slaag, exiled himself and took control of the Gordunni ogres that reside there.  Even at such a distance, we cannot afford to leave him in peace, lest he return when the rest of his brothers have been slain.<name>, you must travel there, and bring back his standard as proof that he has been dealt with."
2734,The Tortured Earth : Bring up the usurper. You will find him. Follow earthen path. First you put to rest tortured earth spirits. Must sleep once more.<Gordawg smashes his fist into the ground and brings up very foul smelling soil.>Must sleep!<Gordawg points southeast.>Find spirits near mountains. Near hills. Near rocks. Near earth.Put to sleep.Telaari Basin... Southeast.
2735,"Mo'mor the Breaker : You must seek out Mo'mor immediately! You will find him in the center of Telaar, by the fountain. Tell him exactly what the ogre told you."
2736,Warchief's Command: Nagrand! : We have lost contact with the druids of the Cenarion ThicketThe Warchief has commanded any able bodies of the Horde to venture into Terokkar Forest and discover what has happened.The thicket can be found by heading northwest through Terokkar Forest from Zangarmarsh.

2739,"WANTED: Boss Grog'ak : Wanted - Dead or Alive: Boss Grog'ak, overseer of the Ango'rosh mushroom-cutting operation.This brute and his axe-wielding cronies are responsible for chopping down the mushrooms to the north of town. Unless he is stopped, he and his band will cut a path to the walls of Zabra'jin.<He/She> who presents the head of Boss Grog'ak to Shadow Hunter Denjai shall be well-rewarded."
2740,"Ishanah : Now that you've decided to side with the Aldor, you'd do well to introduce yourself to their leader.  You will find High Priestess Ishanah inside the Shrine of Unending Light."
2741,"Culling the Wild : The number of atrocities committed by the Burning Legion is countless. Even as we speak, they send their legion forces against the creatures of this land. Helpless to defend against their power, they fall one by one. <name>, help me stop these crimes of nature destroy all which they corrupt. Over the hill, east of here, you will see the corruption spreading across Bladed Gulch. Kill the ones causing the crime, the Fel Corrupters, and as many Felsworn as you can."
2742,"Grand Master Dumphry : The symbol on the key's handle... it is hard to make it out inside the mold, but I recognize it at the Shattered Hand's own.There is a good chance this key will allow you to enter the Shattered Halls.Speak to Dumphry.  He is a master of his craft.  If he can't craft this key for you, no one can."
2743,
2744,Rampaging Ravagers : So Honor Hold sends us to deal with the arakkoa and we set up camp here thinking hey isn't this a great spot.  Little did we know how close we were to the quillfang ravagers.They are relentless predators and have made any sort of work on our part impossible.  There's a bit of coin in it for you if you can deal with them for us.  Do you feel up to it?
2745,"Secrets of the Daggerfen : Bugs, bugs, bugs! The marsh is full of them and my companions here seem obsessed with them.Well, I've had it with the bugs! Something far more intriguing has captured my interest. To the west, there is a village of Lost Ones who call themselves the Daggerfen.The whole tribe consists of highly specialized assassins. I've noticed them mixing and using a particularly potent kind of poison. I'm dying to know more about the poison, but that's going to require a copy of the recipe and a sample vial."
2746,Hero's Call: Nagrand! : The King has requested you represent him with the Kurenai settlement of Telaar in Nagrand.Seek out Warden Moi'bff Jill upon arrival.
2747,"An Unwelcome Presence : Our forces at Thrallmar thought they had the fel orcs contained in the Hellfire Citadel area, but the recent arrivals at the ruins to the east say otherwise.We can't permit them to gain a foothold here. Rokag has dispatched Shadowstalker Kaide to the ruins to keep an eye on them, but we have to do something to keep them from digging in.Go to the ruins, decimate their peons, and then look for Kaide in the trees to the north. He'll tell you where to go from there."
2748,
2749,"A Special Thank You : You honor us with your efforts on our behalf.  And now there is someone that we would like for you to meet.Jho'nass is our most trusted quartermaster.  He maintains a stock of goods that we provide for sale to only the most dedicated of friends to Ogri'la.You are one such friend, <name>.When you find the time, go and speak with him.  As we understand it, he has prepared a little something for you as a token of our appreciation."
2750,"Fierce Enemies : If you seek to prove your loyalty to us, there is no better way than to fight against our enemies.Of these, there are none that can match the ogres in strength and fierceness.  Bring me the warbeads they wear around their necks as proof of their demise and I'll let the others know of your prowess."
2751,"Concerns About Tuurem : The rumors from Tuurem are unsettling. Some say the town's ruins are overrun with crazed Broken and Lost Ones, while opportunistic artifact hunters steal draenei relics.It's hard to know which are true and which aren't, but we have a responsibility to safeguard the ruins as best we can. Find Andarl at the Allerian Stronghold in Terokkar Forest. He is something of a student of magical relics. More than anyone else, he's likely to know what's going on there."
2752,"WANTED: Chieftain Mummaki : Wanted: Chieftain Mummaki - leader of the foul and degenerate Lost One tribe of the Daggerfen, for his brutal attacks against the Orebor Harborage.The chieftain and his band of assassins are responsible for the deaths of numerous Kurenai and draenei and should only be approached by seasoned combatants.Travelers are advised to avoid the Daggerfen Village area to the west of the Orebor Harborage.To claim the bounty, present proof of the chietain's demise to Ikuti."
2753,"...and a Time for Action : We will not stand idly by while they decimate the Ruuan Weald around us.  Our first priority must be to the trees.<class>, I want you to go back out into the Weald and deliver a very different message for us.  I want you to slay every one of their hewers that you come into contact with!If they will not listen to reason, perhaps they will listen to a more assertive method of persuasion!"
2754,"They Took Our Men! : You have to help us!  We were in the middle of an expedition into the mountains to set up a transmission tower when we were attacked.They looked like vrykul, except their skin was blue and layered with frost... and they were all female!  They took all the men in the expedition and let us women go.  Please, <name>!  We think they're being held in Sifreldar, the village overlooking K3."
2755,"Just Following Orders : Okay <guy/lady>, Rakjak have very important job. You go capture injured big-tongue that tracker spotted at river to north.Not bring hunter this time because they maybe want to just kill it. I want to hide it so that I can poke it and make it tell me things.Go you and bring me big-tongue prize thing."
2756,"The Champion's Call! : Pfft, what happens down here ain't fightin'. It's a couple of guys dancin' around a flag.You lookin' for some real action, buddy? 'Cause if you are I got the hottest ticket in town.Ever heard of Gurgthock and Wodin? Goblin and troll who ran the Ring of Blood back in Outland? Well they're here in Northrend and they've started up a whole new fight club over in Zul'Drak. If you're interested go to Zul'Drak, east of Crystalsong. They're at the big arena in the center. Tell 'em Shifty sent ya!"
2757,"It's All Fun and Games : The Knights of the Ebon Blade want to take the Scourge base known as The Shadow Vault to the northwest. I have a contact in their group who has asked for help.The first step is to blind the Lich King. He's using a device known as The Ocular to watch the area, which floats above the vault's spires.Our goblins have created something for you to use against it. After the 'eye' has been destroyed, find Baron Sliver on the vault grounds. He's pretending to still be under the Lich King's will."
2758,"The Battered Hilt : This battered old sword hilt has seen better days. Before the hilt was snapped from the blade, it must've been a magnificent example of the blacksmith's art.The graceful symbols and exotic gemstones decorating the hilt suggest that the weapon may have belonged to a powerful person. Surely, the Silver Covenant members would be interested in hearing about the recovery of such an artifact. Seek out their representative at Quel'Delar's Rest, south of the Argent Tournament Grounds."
2759,"Honor Above All Else : Long has been the path to our salvation, young <class>. We have fought across continents, worlds even, to reach this point. Now we face our greatest challenge: the destruction of the Lich King and his Scourge.Alas, we fight this battle divided. The Horde and Alliance are in the throes of war and will lend us no support. We must remain unyielding in our cause! For what choice have we to do otherwise?Do you join the cause? Lend us your strength, <class>! My commander, Entari, awaits you at his post."
2760,"Just a Few More Things... : As you may have noticed, we created the airstrip on the southern border of a magnataur den!<Crafty says something uncharitable about Fizzcrank under her breath.>The old man has put me in charge of finding a... ahem... creative solution to this situation: if we don't deal with them soon, they'll come down here and tear us limb from limb!That's where you come in. I want you to get me everything on this shopping list. Please."
2761,"Forging an Alliance : <Thorim, for the first time since your meeting him, smiles.>This is all beginning to have the smell of fate's hand, <race>.Your discovery is what remains of my armor, long ago cast off in a fit of grief and left to the elements. Only the sons of Hodir are capable of its reforging, for they are its original creators.Perhaps you've done enough to soften their hatred of me. Seek out their king, Jokkum, if he still breathes.Find your way into his good graces and plead for his assistance."
2762,"The Way to His Heart... : The Northsea Pirates slaughtered the isles' alpha sea lion bull, Big Roy. They made soap from him to clean the decks of their ships!<Anuniaq sighs.>Now the sea lions won't mate. Help me to repopulate their numbers.The reef bulls can be found at the Twin Shores to the southeast. They crave the tasty reef fish that can be found on the east and west sides of the isles.Take this net and gather enough fish, at least a dozen -- maybe more, to lure a bull across the strait to a reef cow."
2763,"Filling the Cages : 'Ol Budd's seen better days.Ever since our stay in Ghostlands he's been useless to us. We've had to find ways to make it on our own, and today that means sellin' trolls to the highest bidder.Fortunately, we've recently found a use for Budd. Something about his condition allows him to mingle with the local trolls, so we taught him a little game that's turned us a tidy profit.See for yourself. Talk to Budd, take him southwest to Drak'Zin Ruins and use this cage as soon as he tags a troll."
2764,"Get Kraken! : The Sunreavers and Silver Covenant sent ships north to engage the Kvaldir at Hrothgar's Landing, but were intercepted and detained by a Kvaldir Raiding vessel.  To make matters worse, the Kvaldir have found a way to call forth the dreaded Kraken that lives beneath the North Sea.  If anyone on board is to get out alive, that Kraken must be driven away and the Kvaldir's summoning ritual ... disrupted.Crusader, take these spears and an Argent Hippogryph will take you to the battle."
2765,"Keristrasza : I am... free?I was destined to spend an eternity roaming an empty abyss, and now am saved? You cannot fathom my gratitude, mortal.When I refused to bend to his will Malygos bound me to that prison, then shattered it and scattered the pieces. Should I live one hundred of your lifetimes, I shall not forget this kindness.Perhaps, in time, I will find ways to repay you. For now, though, we must focus our attention on Malygos. I am weak, and there is much to be done.I need your help, <name>."
2766,"Betrayal : The time has come to end this charade, <name>.As valuable as your information has been, we must bring Drakuru down and bring his project to an end before his freaks are unleashed.We've modified your scepter for the job. When the time is right, you will be able to use it on Drakuru's Blightbloods and turn them against him. It's your only hope of defeating him.Fight well."
2767,"Cold Hearted : To be slain honorably on the field of battle brings us all glory. To be frozen in a block of ice and endlessly taunted does not....You are to fly to the frost giant city of Dun Niffelem, just east of the Valley of Ancient Winters, and liberate our captive proto-drakes. With them, you will be able to free our sisters from their frozen bonds and carry them safely home.Beware the giants' clubs, sister, lest you find yourself numbered among the captives."
2768,"The Black Knight's Fall : We must put an end to the Black Knight's scheming, and show those who oppose us that we will not stand by and allow our champions to be murdered.By now, he will suspect that someone is on his trail. Challenge him in the light of day, where he cannot refuse or murder in the dark, <name>.Use my argent charger for the battle. It's housed in the stables.Speak to Squire Cavin at the Ring of Champions. The squire will call the Black Knight to battle, but you will make him answer for his crimes."
2769,"The Amphitheater of Anguish: Yggdras! : I'll tell you what, buddy, this place is a far cry from the rolling plains of Nagrand. These trolls are dirtier than ogres; but hey, I go where the gold's at! So welcome to Zul'Drak, pal.You're new to this racket, so let me set you straight. I'm the fight promoter and this feisty troll next to me is Wodin, my bodyguard. You're the entertainment. When you wanna fight, let me know and I'll set up the match.If you're ready and got a group of friends with you, we can start! What do you say?"
2770,"The Magical Kingdom of Dalaran : Hello, <name>. You may or may not be aware that we Kirin Tor moved our city here to Northrend.No longer does Dalaran sit under its protective dome on the shores of Lordamere Lake. Now the city magically floats above the Crystalsong Forest.We believe you to be ready for your journey to the city. Speak with me again and I will cast a spell of teleportation to transport you there.When you arrive, seek out Archmage Celindra and give her my signet as proof that we spoke."
2771,"Heart of Flame : You are the first mortal to witness a dragon council, <name>, and among the only beings in Azeroth to take part in the choosing of an Aspect.My ascension has endowed me with incredible power. I have taken the liberty to strengthen Tarecgosa's bond with you, though she will require a more... permanent home.I would have you venture one last time into the Plane of Fire and bring me the heart of Ragnaros.When next we meet, I will be able to suitably thank you for all that you have done."
2772,"Rare Earth : It seems so long ago that these hammers pounded and hewed stone instead of iron. Our expulsion from Ulduar saw the weakest of us dead and the strongest of our craftsmen reborn as warriors.As the irons beat us back, even the strongest find themselves failing.We can do little for the wounded, save when we have a stock of enchanted earth. We used to mine it from the deposits on the sheer cliff face to the northwest, but the constant battle has prevented us from replenishing our stock. Would you help?"
2773,"Into the World of Spirits : While the Explorers' League may discern bits and pieces of the past through their archaeological findings and the Vice Admiral might extract some knowledge of the present through brute force, the truth lies with the spirits.With the proper reagents I am able to see into the spirit world. It is there that the past, present and future of Northrend resides.If you wish to learn more, I will require my reagent pouch. It was lost in a ship that is now at the bottom of Daggercap Bay, just east of here."
2774,"A Strange Device : Picking up this strange device, you are certain that it is magical in nature. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to connote any other kind of use.Perhaps the archmage back at Stars' Rest to the east of the Moonrest Gardens would be able to tell what it's used for?"
2775,"A Hero's Burden : Perhaps the crystals will ward off the undead gradually, but there is one more thing that must be done.We need to find the leader of these undead and kill him to ensure there's no one to push the wretches back upon us. If my suspicions are correct, he will be somewhere inside the fallen pillar... the Sundered Shard.The corpses being dragged there would suggest as much anyway.I'll place the shards and bring the news to Soo-say... I'll leave the rest up to you."
2776,"Last Rites : I served Arthas in death, because I had no choice.  He had control over my will and my body.  The Cult of the Damned serves Arthas in life... willingly.Now that we know the words of power to enter Naxxanar we can put an end to the cultist blight.  Go to En'kilah and look for the teleportation orb beneath the floating citadel.Work your way up and meet me at the top.  Arm yourself with what courage you can, we might not make it out of this alive."

Speak with one to ride it into battle.Without your help, <name>, we will surely lose."
2778,The Black Knight's Orders : We must discover who sent the Black Knight to the tournament and what his master hopes to gain by killing the competitors.The Kirin Tor has offered to help in this matter and provided us with something to help our search.Take this enchanted bridle to the Black Knight's camp on the eastern edge of the tournament grounds and use it to gain control over the Black Knight's gryphon. The bridle's magic will force the gryphon to take you to his master's home. Search it and return with anything you find.
2779,"The Part-time Hunter : When Hemet asked me to accompany Marvin out here, I hoped that I might have the opportunity to work on my own hunting skills in between repairing the flying machines and setting up the camp.I wanted to take down a ferocious lion named Pitch. He's said to make his home south of here, near where the Wildgrowth Mangal meets the northern face of the Skyreach Pillar. If you can find the beast, would you bring back his remains? If the rumors are true, they'd make a trophy even Hemet will respect!"
2780,"The Argent Tournament : We have invited you here to test your skill and valor against others who have bravely opposed the Scourge. Many have been our divisions, but the time has come for heroes fighting under all banners to test their blades against one another in preparation for facing our mutual enemy.Arcanist Taelis is the Silver Covenant's representative to the tournament and he'll enter your name into the rolls and begin your training. Seek him out inside the large Alliance tent in the northeastern part of the grounds."
2781,"The Edge Of Winter : Curse that death knight for breaking my sword!In southern Crystalsong Forest, overlooking the Crystal Vice's exit, you will find Lord Everblaze. Kill him and take the everburning ember from his corpse.Bring it to the center of Winter's Breath Lake in northern Howling Fjord, and use it to free the maiden encased in ice. She is the guardian of an ancient sword and will award it to whoever frees her.Prove your worth and earn the weapon that she has guarded for so long, <name>."
2782,"The Storm King's Vengeance : My people have been decimated by the Lich King. The Scourge now use the corpses of storm giants to create mindless flesh giants, or worse, stitched together aberrations like Thrym.I will stop at nothing to see them all driven from this world. We will work together to destroy the Scourge that threaten Zul'Drak.We will kill them all: Navarius, Algar and Thrym!When you are ready, let me know and we will begin our destructive journey."
2783,"The Champion of Anguish : This is the end, my friend! Your last opponent is going to be your greatest challenge. He's a vrykul champion from the steppes of Icecrown and he's out for blood! Defeat him and you'll be crowned the champion of the Amphitheater of Anguish! This fight is going to make us both rich!Let me know when you're ready and we'll start."
2784,"No Place to Run : They're drawing power from the bones of my dead brothers...I have no love for the cult, but I'm baffled by their audacity. There will be no mercy shown for them... not that I ever would have anyway.Ensure that they have no place to flee when the slaughter starts. Place a destructive ward at the end of the path leading out of the shrine... where the road starts to give way to snow. Defend it until it is fully charged."
2785,"The Last Line Of Defense : I've triggered the base's defenses, <class>! Atop each of the Vanguard's four towers is a retractable Argent Crusade cannon, blessed by Father Gustav himself. You'll need to fly up to one of those towers and man a cannon. Use it to destroy the Scourge onslaught that the Lich King has deployed.Just one warning, the Scourge will undoubtedly send their frost wyrms to lay siege to the towers. Shoot them out of the sky! If they destroy the walls and towers of this base, we're done for!"
2786,"Mending Fences : If I hope to wrest control of the Temple of the Makers from my brother, I must make amends with my old allies.Perhaps by eliminating a common enemy, we may at least take a step towards renewing my friendship with the frost giants.Fjorn has besieged Dun Niffelem with giants of iron. You must defeat him at Fjorn's Anvil, far to the east of here, and weaken his forces sufficiently for the Sons of Hodir to emerge victorious.Take this charm, <name>. Use it to summon my earthen to your aid."
2787,"Free Your Mind : Vile, Lady Nightswood, and The Leaper would make excellent weapons in the fight against the Lich King if they can be broken from his will. That is what the Sovereign Rod is for.You'll find them on the ledges to the east and west of the vault, as well as on the mid-tier of the vault above us. The rod is to be used upon the corpses of the three.Fly now. We will have them as our own!"

2789,"Slim Pickings : Cold out here, isn't it, <race>?Ko'char has refused to meet with me. It seems he has more pressing things on his mind - namely, the jormungar that have been attacking them from the cavern below. Maybe you can help me convince Ko'char that I'm one of the good guys.I saw a giant being eaten by some of the worms at the entrance to the cavern north of here... I'm still puzzled as to how the worms are killing them so easily. Bring me a sample from one of his wounds."
2790,"A Worthy Weapon : Of all the times to have such rotten luck! My blade is missing!I've heard the bards telling tales of travelers offering winter hyacinths to a lonely maiden in return for gifts. Those hyacinths grow only on the ice flowing from the Ironwall Dam, on Crystalsong Forest's northwestern border with Icecrown. Gather the flowers and take them to the circle of lamps in Drak'Mar Lake in northeastern Dragonblight, near Zul'Drak and Grizzly Hills. Ask the lonely maiden for a worthy blade."
2791,"A Blade Fit For A Champion : I've heard that the Alliance champions are seeking after ancient blades for their warriors. We can't afford to let them have that kind of advantage.There's an old legend from Grizzly Hills about a maiden cursed with a frog's form to protect the blade she has long guarded. She lives among the lake frogs on the shore of Ashwood Lake, just east of Ashwood Post. The only thing said to break the curse is a kiss, freely given. Apply this balm before kissing anything, <name>. Otherwise, you'll catch warts."
2792,"The Conquest Pit: Bear Wrestling! : So you're interested in the fights, eh?  Well, Krenna has outlawed pit-fighting for all enlisted combatants.  But you, my friend, are technically a free agent and are not included in this prohibition.Nice loophole, eh?Anyway, if you're interested I can start you off with something easy, a measly bear.  I'll even let you bring friends along!"
2793,"Preparing for the Worst : Dark times are upon us.  Karkut's spirit walks the earth and gathers the spirits of dead tuskarr.The sons of the mist have taken many of our brethren.  Soon dear Kaskala will be reduced to ashes.There is hope yet.  Not for us perhaps, but we've sent our families to Unu'pe.  We fight here so there may be a future for them.They will need supplies or they will starve.  There's not enough food in Unu'pe.  Salvage any supplies before it's too late for our families."
2794,"Patching Up : Remember all that gnomish duct tape you brought me?Well, I've found a use for it. The body of this flying machine is so banged up in places, that I'm going to need to reinforce it if I ever hope to fly.Dorain over there has been telling me that the taunka use steam cured caribou leather for making watertight containers. Marsh caribou live all around the village and in the Flood Plains to the south. Get the best hides you can find and cure them over the steam vents in the Geyser Fields."

Go or I taunt you a second time!<Gekgek waves his spear around menacingly.>"
2797,"There's Something About the Squire : Every day, the Black Knight's squire, Maloric, makes a big show of heading to Crystalsong Forest with his axe over his shoulder. He wants us to believe he's chopping wood, but he never returns with more than a few twigs.He usually goes toward the ruins southwest of the Mirror of Twilight. He spends a lot of time out there, even for a squire with responsibilities to his knight.Find a way to distract or incapacitate him and search him. If he's up to something, we'll know it."
2798,"The Etymidian : It is time, <name>.  The Waygate has been activated for the first time in seven centuries.  Use it to travel to where our final hope lies.Let us put an end to those who would seek to bring the taint of undeath to this pristine land.  Let us unleash the Etymidian."
2799,"The Hunt is On : I've made it my business to learn as much as possible about the vile death cult, including their secret language.Vurenn was right.  The cultists mention disguised operatives in various locations in Valiance Keep: the lower docks, the jail inside the inner hold and in the inn's kitchen.Take this oculus.  Use it at those three locations - anyone that has recently used the cult's necromancy will be enshrouded by a dark aura.  Take care of the cultists before something nefarious happens."
2800,"Post-partum Aggression : Broodmother Slivina's likely to be a snarling ball of teeth, spikes, and talons. You've gone and stolen her children away and no mother takes kindly to that.'Tis true they hatched from eggs, but she loves the little beasts no less than your mother loves you.She'll be desperate and fierce in equal measures, everything Hemet loves in a target. You and he, along with that mammoth, should be a match for her.She's on her perch at the northern edge of the Savage Thicket and hungers for revenge."
2801,"Tirion's Gambit : Just this morning, my scouts informed me of a Cult of the Damned procession leaving from Icecrown Citadel to the Cathedral of Darkness, bearing an artifact.And now I learn that it might be Arthas's own heart... a thing containing the last bit of his remaining humanity.This is a sign of the Light.  As long as such an artifact exists, there is a chance that Arthas Menethil can become a man again!Meet me at the cathedral's entrance.  Be sure to bring a cultist's hood -- we're going incognito."
2802,"Killing Two Scourge With One Skeleton : The workers in the Fleshwerks abomination lab have already completed a number of their creations. For now, the creatures are chained to the pillars around the edge of the lab, but if we do not act, they will march with the Lich King's armies.Grasping arms reach out of the bone piles spread throughout the Fleshwerks. These arms belong to skeletons enchanted with the power of fire. Find and free these skeletons, then take them near the completed abominations and watch the show!"
2803,"Light Within the Darkness : <Crusader Bridenbrad's tabard rests in the bottom of the chest, shifting slightly as the howling wind finds its way in.>Tirion will desire this last remnant of the great crusader."

Nobody be knowin' how old dey be or what dey be sayin', but with the eye and the heart Drakuru can be readin' dem. Dey lie deep inside the crypt at Drakil'jin, due east of here.Once ya got the tablets, get sacred mojo from the oracles and protectors so ya can summon me there. They'd be proud to be dyin' for such a cause."
2805,"The Last of Her Kind : For as long as I can remember, we've obtained our best bears from the Hibernal Cave to the east.Those times might finally be gone.  The cave has been overrun by ravenous jormungar and the wild bears are all but extinct.If you were to find a surviving matriarch, however, I would guarantee you that she would fight better than any of these bears born in captivity.Take this harness to the Hibernal Cave and rescue a surviving matriarch.  Good luck finding one."
2806,"Time Grows Short : Tarecgosa is bound to you, <name>, but only temporarily. An aspect's power is required to permanently seal her essence.Malygos's successor will not be chosen until Azeroth's moons next eclipse, and the bond you share will not last until then.Fortunately, there is a way to buy us the time we need. Powerful elements exist that can extend the ritual's effects. Some of these can be found in the Plane of Fire, with which you've become familiar.Obtain them, <class>, and sustain Tarecgosa until the eclipse."
2807,"Keep the Secret Safe : Our existence here depends entirely upon staying hidden. Should the shield fail, even for a moment, Malygos' minions would have us.One of my responsibilities is to rejuvenate the warmages' mana levels so their focus doesn't falter. With our supply lines lost, I've been forced to improvise.I could use your help, <name>.Very near the Nexus, Arcane Serpents feast on the abundant magical energies. Once defeated, they will yield a mana essence that I can make use of."
2808,"Reclamation : It is time, <name>.  The Etymidian is one of the most destructive forces ever created by the titans and I am loathe to unleash him in my lands.There is little choice, however.  Our enemies have forced my hand and the fury of the titans will cleanse all."

He be hidin' in one of da huts in Zeb'Halak.It be a shame to kill Zim'bo, mon, but he swore da blood oath to defend Drak'Tharon and he done failed. Now at least his mojo be helpin' us to reclaim Drak'Tharon."
2810,"A Spark of Hope : Clearly, this is more than an ordinary hunk of metal.Unlike any ore you're familiar with, it is hard but not brittle, far lighter than it looks, and glows even when cool.Looking closer, you can make out one of Thorim's runes shining beneath the surface...."
2811,"Return To Myralion Sunblaze : We must get this book to Myralion Sunblade. Would you bring it to him? I cannot rely on anyone else to transport the book and you have proven adept at evading the Silver Covenant's men.Take it with you to Quel'Delar's Rest, south of the Argent Tournament Grounds in Icecrown. Myralion will be waiting for you. If he can identify that blade, we may be able to claim it in the name of Aethas Sunreaver and show Dalaran and the Alliance that we will lead the charge against the Lich King."
2812,"The Underground Menace : Lion killer, chicken chaser, new Frenzyheart slave...I know you no want to stay slave, so I tell you what to do.

By studying that gun he managed to put together a comprehensive operation manual.Unfortunately he was abducted and taken north of here to Wyrmskull Village. We eventually did find him, but near death and without the manual. His dying words indicated that the manual was lost in the Utgarde Catacombs, located at the northwest end of Wyrmskull. Get me that manual!"
2814,"It Goes to 11... : We must strike while the vrykul forces are in disarray! Take the harpoon control mechanism to Nifflevar and locate the northernmost harpoon building on the bluff side of the village.Once there, commandeer one of the vrykul harpoon guns that are stationed on the building's deck. Use the harpoon gun to rain hell upon Wyrmskull Village! Destroy the longhouse, dockhouse, storage facility and any defenders that the vrykul may send at you!Do this and Daggercap Bay will become a much safer port!"
2815,"Saragosa's End : Using the mana crystals you provided, I have created this Power Focus.Saragosa is a glutton. She will be unable to resist its lure. Inside it lie magics that will greatly diminish her power. Let us hope she does not see through my ruse....Prepare yourself, <name>, and speak to me again when you are ready to face Saragosa."
2816,"Hazardous Materials : Blight crystals?! What could this scumbag Drakuru be up to? Clearly, he's working on something significant.Continue to do his bidding and perhaps once he's more familiar with you he'll reveal his plans. In the meantime, we need to have a look at these crystals.While you're in Voltarus, try to get some samples of the harvested crystals when no one's looking.Be alert! Handling those crystals can trigger your disguise to fail."
2817,"The Refiner's Fire : Beneath its porous exterior, this hunk of metal gleams with a mysterious quality.You feel it would only be prudent to burn off the slag at Fjorn's Anvil.As you ponder where in this frozen waste you might find something hot enough for the job, a fire revenant crosses your path..."
2818,"Nordrassil's Bough : Much has transpired since last we spoke.I have taken it upon myself to visit the Nexus and recover Anachronos's artifact, but not before using it for myself.

All we have now are a few bottles of rum, and it won't sustain a thirsty expedition!We need to get some booze cooking, and fast!!The trees in the Wildgrowth Mangal, to the east, seem laden with fruit, but it's too high for me to reach.

Valgarde is located in Daggercap Bay, also to the northwest. Speak with McGoyver to get the ingots. He'll fly you back here once you're all done."
2822,"Springing the Trap : We owe this opportunity in great part to your efforts, <name>.It is only fitting that you initiate the attack on Malygos.Take this spark and use it to light the signal fire northwest of the Nexus. Keristrasza will direct you from there."

It's the one next to church, across from the stables and the lumbermill.Once you acquire the diary, take it to the high executor back at Venomspite.You'll have to do this the old-fashioned way; the power of the mirror is low and there's only enough left for me.<The agent smirks.>"
2824,"Return To Caladis Brightspear : We must get this book to Caladis Brightspear immediately. Would you bring it to him? I cannot rely on anyone else to transport the book and you have proven adept at keeping the Sunreavers at bay.Take it with you to Quel'Delar's rest, south of the Argent Tournament Grounds in Icecrown. Caladis and the sword will be waiting. The sooner we can identify the blade, the sooner we can claim it."

Their hides are tough and just the right thickness.  Bring me some and we'll get you started on the path of the bear-rider."
2827,"Jin'arrak's End : It is good to see you back among the living. Many who travel the path of the dead do not return to speak of it.While you were away, a vision appeared to Kraz revealing what remains to be done.A sacred offering lies somewhere inside the crypt. Take this spirit dust fashioned from the remnants you collected and use it on the offering.The infused offering will bring an end to the corrupted warlord and will release the many tormented souls.May the spirits guide your actions, <name>."

Soon we shall know....I am a seasoned trainer of the graceful drakes of the red dragonflight. My business here is to study the enemy and teach my precious pets the tactics that will be most effective when we face the master of the blues.To demonstrate your nerve and ability, I will allow you to ride one of my drakes against the enemy's minions.The opportunity is yours for the asking..."
2829,"The Frozen Heart of Isuldof : Some say Jonah was never quite right in the head, but I know the truth. It was the heart. That damned frozen heart! I saw the change in him the second he pulled it from the grave. I could see the blood freeze in his veins... It was then that the madness truly took over.He left us to hole up in his cave on the north side of this island. Last I heard he had thrown the heart in the back of his bear den. Too little, too late...I'll kill you myself if you even think about bringing that heart back here!"
2830,"Truce? : Watch yerself, mon.Drakuru shrunk more <race> heads than I can remember - and even if I could remember, I couldn't count that high.

Hearing of your exploits, he has secluded himself and his family at their stronghold up the steps to the northeast.The warlord is strong and you will need help.

2832,"The Drakkensryd : This is it.  You've passed all the tests of the Hyldsmeet... all but one.  You've risen among our sisters' best and fiercest.The final test is at hand.  The Drakkensryd - the true test of a Hyldnir's worth and warrior spirit.  It'll be you, your riding drake, a chained harpoon and a score of your sisters vying for dominance.Show no quarter.  None will be expected."
2833,"The Jig is Up : I know why you're here, <name>.  You've been sent to kill our leader, Jonah Sterling.I'd like to offer my help.  Jonah's leadership threatens our operation.Attacking the Horde and the Alliance fleets simultaneously?  Suicidal.  Trying to sell the tuskarr as slaves when they die days after leaving this climate?  Disastrous.Jonah's hideout is located inside a cave west of here.  Bring me his spyglass as proof of the deed and my first action as leader will be to end all attacks against your allies."
2834,"Words of Power : The lich has spoken, <name>.  The high priests of En'kilah hold the secret to entering Naxxanar.Go to the Spire of Blood, the Spire of Pain and the Spire of Decay and slay each of the priests.Return once you've obtained the three scrolls."

Fortunately, the Scourge has provided a perfect place for you to stitch him back together.Near the Fleshwerks' flesh giant lab is the Sanctum of Reanimation.

2836,"The Black Knight of Silverpine? : No doubt you've heard the disturbing rumors about the contestant the others are calling the Black Knight. It's said that any rider who was scheduled to face him in combat has met an untimely end.Of course, we have no definitive proof of anything, but it wouldn't hurt to look into this knight's background.He claims to hail from Valgan's Field in Silverpine Forest. It's a small farm on the western shore of Lordamere Lake. Would you visit the farm and let me know if there's any truth to his story?"

Hold no fear in your heart."
2838,"Basic Chemistry : <Thassarian takes the pustulant spines and drains their fluid into a flask.>A little-known quality of the flesh giants...Their spinal fluid interacts with the plague in a very interesting way, turning it into a corrosive acid.Poured from the towering ramparts, acid may not be a welcome sight to the troops below, but at least the victims won't rise up and add to the enemy's numbers.Pour the contents of this flask into one of the plague cauldrons in the western chamber of the death gate."

2840,"The Heart of the Storm : According to the documents you captured at Narvir's Cradle, the iron colossus is complete except for one key component -- the Heart of the Storm.Without it, the iron colossus' weapons would be much weaker than the design predicts. If we can deny Overseer Narvir the heart, we could defeat the colossus!Notes on the documents you found say that the heart is in Uldis, a titan facility far to the south. Its entrance is on the south side of a tall mountain overlooking the Bor's Breath River."
2841,"That Which Creates Can Also Destroy : Since we only have three seeds, we must put them to the best possible use.Your targets are one of the reanimated frost wyrms circling to the north near Galakrond's Rest, Turgid the Vile in the ruined barracks at the Carrion Fields to the east, and Overseer Deathgaze at Jintha'kalar far to the northeast.While the seeds would outright destroy one of the lesser Scourge, they will greatly weaken these three. Enough so, in fact, that you should be able to handle them on your own."
2842,"The Dead Rise! : The path east of us is a primary hunting trail of the tuskarr. At least that's what it used to be...More recently our hunters have been returning to Kamagua claiming that the dead have risen and are out for blood! That is what has brought my son and me here.

Rejek show big-tongues how to get power by taking it!Far to northwest, there is large, flat area the big-tongues call 'Stormwright's Shelf.'

Kill them for their badness, then take it to the big-tongue 'Shrine of the Tempest' at shelf's western side. Rejek will await your return with ultimate power."
2846,"Horn of the Ancient Mariner : A Kvaldir lieutenant known as Orabus directed the initial incursion against my people at Pal'ea, He oversaw the destruction of both villages and then disappeared into the mist.In those early days there was talk of a horn that Orabus gifted to the Kvaldir mistweavers. This horn could be used to summon him should the need arise.We need to get that horn from the Kvaldir mistweavers and call forth Orabus. If he is destroyed, these savages might retreat.Seek out mistweavers at Pal'ea, to the south."

Little did they know that I'm the chief transmatter engineer for the airstrip!With your help, and a little elbow-grease, I won't be in here for long.I'm going to need an engine-core crystal from one of the ghouls in here, a magical gyroscope from their doctor, and a piloting scourgestone from the lich-lord up top.With all of that stuff, I should be able to make a port device to get back to Fizzcrank's and escape the gnome way!"
2848,"Need More Info : The Cult of the Damned are notorious for concocting grandiose plans that in the end, rarely succeed. But something feels different this time....Perhaps it's the proximity to the Lich King that has their fervor heightened. Whatever it is, they appear to be more confident than ever. We must know what feeds this bravado and then find a way to strip them of it!I believe the key lies with their researchers. Find out what they're up to and report back to me with the details."
2849,"Mutiny on the Mercy : Aye, we got problems, matey. Me gunners have mutinied! M'n'the crew up top be tryin' to kick Sorlof's keester while dealin' with the mutinous gunners down'blo.Ye're gonna have to go down'blo and deal with those mutinous sea dogs and take their blastin' powder for the big'un o'er on the poop deck.With ye mannin' the big'un, Sorlof is sure to die and give up the booty!"

I must discover their significance.<Raelorasz pokes his hand with a spear and coats the tip with his blood.>Take this and use it on one of them.

2851,"Through a Glass, Darkly : <Tarecgosa listens as you explain your presence in Coldarra.>Your tale rings true, <class>. Much has changed since the death of Malygos - little of it for the better.I know of the device you carry, and I recognize Anachronos' magic in its creation.

Speak with me again inside the Nexus and you shall have it."

I do not recall seeing or hearing of a sword with these markings, but that doesn't mean that all is lost.Korialstrasz, better known as Krasus, has long been a friend to the quel'dorei and the Kirin Tor. With his vast knowledge and resources, he's certain to know something.

Why the Scarlet Onslaught is interested in such things is unknown, but by the look of things, the area surrounding the cave is heavily guarded. Nonetheless, we must proceed!Take this scrying orb and travel north out of town and then northwest towards Scarlet Point. Make your way into the cave and battle your way to the bottom. Once there, use the orb. Return here with what you discover."
2856,Really Big Worm : The jormungar have a spawnmother in the caverns below. We call her Rattlebore - a name that was gifted to her by an adventurer from the Plaguelands.

2857,"A Victory For The Silver Covenant : In spite of Queen Lana'thel's boasting, you have restored Quel'Delar, <name>. Long have we dreamt of reclaiming Quel'Delar.The Silver Covenant, and indeed all quel'dorei owe you a debt of gratitude.As a <class>, the sword seems to know you lack the training to wield it and hasn't bonded to you.

2859,"A Suitable Disguise : Getting you inside the Sunreaver's Sanctuary will be tougher than it appears. Only those who possess Sunreaver tabards are permitted entry to sanctuary. If we can get our hands on one, a simple enchantment will do the rest of the work.On the balcony above Threads of Fate, you'll find Shandy Glossgleam. I've helped him a few times in the past, so he owes me a favor. He handles laundry for a wide variety of people in the city. Maybe he can find a way to 'lend' you a tabard for a while."
2860,"The Hunter and the Prince : Before the prince became a king, he fought many battles... but only one where he came close to dying.It was fought right here.  After you let me show you what happened, you'll understand everything.Find a bloodstained stone and pick it up from the floor.  You'll see what happened."
2861,"The Keeper's Favor : There are those of this world that tap into power unrestricted by the bounds of our mortal frames - powers of restoration, powers of life, and powers of light.

It was when we approached the graveyard known as Shield Hill that we were attacked by the undead. I was lucky to make it to this camp, but I am uncertain as to what became of Orfus.We parted ways at the Ancient Lift, southeast of here along the cliff edge. Will you go see if he is ok?"
2865,"Abduction : <name>, we have a situation.I've just learned that one of our archmages en route from Dalaran has gone missing. Naturally, we suspect the mage hunters are behind her disappearance.Time is clearly of the essence. We must know what has become of Lady Evanor at once if we are to have any hope of rescuing her.Take this device. Return to Beryl Point and use it on a Beryl sorcerer when he is near death. It should bind him long enough for you to bring him here for questioning."
2866,Return to Atuik : Return to Elder Atuik at Kamagua. He and the rest of my people must be warned of this impending doom that approaches from the sea.<Orfus shivers.>Use the Ancient Lift to reach him. Please hurry!
2867,"Ample Inspiration : Wow! That stuff is nasty. Not to account for gnoll taste or anything, but I figured whatever they had would at least be... edible?Let's get more creative.Tore's got an explosive dispenser north of town... not far from the big cavern entrance, can't miss it. I'm sure she intends them for mining purposes of some sort, but I've got a better idea.Grab one of those things and rush it to one of the nearby mammoths... most of them are to the west. Collect the meat, bring it back."
2868,"Load'er Up! : Have you seen the flying machines buzzing around? That's gnomish innovation at its finest.I've long waited to get my hands on some of their technology and a perfect opportunity has presented itself. One of their recon wings crashed in the Scalding Pools, in the southwest part of the Geyser Fields.Blow this whistle near one of the crashed machines and my trusty mule, Jenny will answer.

Loud, booming thunder!I think near the end, it was abandoned by all.

Explore around the titan statue inside and report back with your findings."
2871,"The Sunreaver Plan : One of my contacts in the Underbelly caught sight of a Sunreaver agent buying reagents from a dealer in the Black Market area. The Sunreavers normally aren't known for their interest in what goes on in the sewers, so that's a big indication they're planning something.Head into the Underbelly, find this Sunreaver agent, and take care of them. Search the body for any information that might give us a lead on the location of that tome from Wyrmrest. We can't let them get it back to Icecrown first."
2872,"Mystery of the Infinite, Redux : There you are! Or, were we just talking?<Chromie muses over the temporal possibilities.>Anyway, the Infinites are after you! Well, not you per-se. Rather, they're after the past version of you that defended the Hourglass of Eternity. You remember, right?That was you back then, except it's you now too. Wait, that's not important. What is important is that you head back to the Bronze Dragonshrine and defend yourself and the hourglass from their attacks before you get erased from history!"
2873,"Deep in the Bowels of The Underhalls : Deep in the bowels of The Underhalls to the northeast, a mad scientist known as Dr. Terrible is up to something befitting his name.The doctor has been given dispensation by the Lich King to perform experiments upon the vargul -- the vrykul who fall in battle and are found unworthy, and then turned into Scourge.We must put an end to his work, but my auguries have been unable to find him. He does, however, have an assistant.Beat the information out of his apprentice, and then dispose of the body."
2874,"The Taste Test : And now for the moment of truth!<Grimbooze chuckles.>I've always wanted to say that. Normally, I'd debut a new drink at a banquet, but we can't have one in the middle of the jungle.Instead, just take samples to a few trusted friends and return with their comments. Let's see, we'll definitely want Hemet Nesingwary's opinion, and Hadrius Harlowe's, too. They're here in camp. You'll want to head over to Lakeside Landing, near the center of the Basin and offer Tamara Wobblesprocket a taste."

This time, ya need ta mix in some desperate mojo from the defenders there for it ta be workin'."

Fate now allows us to use this knowledge against him.There is a great blue dragon, Saragosa, who circles high above the Nexus. She serves both as the aspect's guardian and as his consort.

The many men of that allied force scattered, but Bridenbrad alone returned and dragged more than a dozen men to safety, one by one through the carnage.<class>, he has not returned since. He was spotted heading to the far northeast, towards the Silent Vigil. Bring him back to me that I might honor him for his valor."

Drakuru's Scourgewagons pose a significant threat. We need them destroyed. Make your way to the wagons and activate these charges. Once they're set, get clear! The explosion will expose you if you're too close."

You're not likely to be able to kill one straight out, so just toss this down its throat when it opens its mouth wide.  Bring me back as many of the slabs of meat as you can tote."
2885,"Data Mining : That disk you assembled... it's blank! That crafty Mimir must've hidden the information somewhere else. Look around the Inventor's Library; do you see any databanks there?That might be what you need to do with the disk. Try using it near some of those databanks. Perhaps it's set to retrieve and store information from them. After you've tried your hand at that, contact me again and let me know what you've found. Meanwhile, I'll be trying to track down the other half of the archive key."

Face the North Wind as Stormhoof, but realize that for the timeline to be restored, Stormhoof must die as the North Wind weakens.Then, you must find and use the Horn of Elemental Fury to destroy the North Wind."
2887,"An Audience With The Arcanist : I've placed an enchantment on the tabard that should allow you to slip past the Silver Enclave's defenses for a short period of time. You should have enough time to find your way up to the top level of the Silver Enclave and meet up with the Silver Covenant's man there, known as Arcanist Tybalin.While disguised, obtain the copy of Ancient Dragonforged Blades that his men borrowed from Wyrmrest, and return the book to me."
2888,"Not Without a Fight! : Kaskala is a sacred place for us, <race>.  Our ancestors were guided here by the spirit of Tayutka herself.Now these foul creatures attack us from the mists without any provocation.We will show them that our spears are not merely for whaling.  Fight alongside us, friend.  Perhaps my people might repay you some time in the future."
2889,"Infiltrating Voltarus : By now you've probably guessed the details of my plan.We're using the Scourge's interest in you against them. You're going undercover. I know it's likely a death sentence, but if we do nothing your death is a certainty.Travel northeast to Reliquary of Pain and stand on the platform while wearing your disguise. Once inside Voltarus, you must earn the trust of the Scourge commander.When you've completed your mission, blow this horn and I'll fly to your location to receive your report."
2890,"Breaking Through : On the lowest tier of the Temple City, there is a gray altar bathed in light. Step into it to gain entry to the dread necropolis Naxxanar.Be cautious, <name>. Prince Valanar will certainly be defended by his personal retainers, who will give their lives to keep you from ascending to the top level of the necropolis.You must find your way through the necropolis to the prince's seat.

No!When the ship ran aground, it damaged my flying machine, the Spirit of Gnomeregan. Now, we're left without any means to send our reports!There is a chance, though, that the Venture Company's antics may work in our favor. They shot down another flying machine right about where Monte parachuted into the swamp to the east. Go there and retrieve the engine. It may be our only hope."
2892,"Send Them Packing : I've heard rumors of bad happenings in the Whisper Gulch to the north. Most of the Explorers' League went down into that place, and some say they went mad with what they discovered.That doesn't change the fact that they took most of our mules and equipment with them, though. I won't lose those mules!If you find yourself in there, and happen across any of my mules, just get up close on them and threaten them with a raised hand. They'll spook and come home for sure."
2893,"The Crone's Bargain : Yes, it must be the little green prisoner you're after...  We might be able to help each other.You're not going to get the goblin out of here by force. Not alive, anyway.Among my people I am known as a Yrkvinn, a practitioner of illusions. As you can see, the Hyldnir have made me their prisoner.If I had my runes, I could make you go unnoticed among them. Further inside, patrolling the mines, you'll find an overseer named Syra. She has my runes. Retrieve them and we'll talk some more."
2894,"Into The Wild Green Yonder : We will do all that we can to assist you, <name>. The proto-brood have volunteered to fly you across the Breach and into Scourgeholme.

2895,"Sniffing Out the Perpetrator : The tone of Brann's note suggests he meant to bury something with the note, maybe a pack of some kind. You're sure this was all you found?Okay, I'm going to have you take one of these frosthounds with you. The frostborn use them for tracking. Bring it to the destroyed camp and let it get Brann's scent.It should at least lead you to the location of those missing possessions, and if we're lucky, Brann himself."
2896,"Chicken Party! : I bet you not guess what happen again.Nope, not Goregek or chickens.Okay, I lie. Goregek let chickens out again. Dumb Goregek and rumbly belly.Let me know if you need help from any of the hunters... they around here somewhere."

Return to the Kor'kron Vanguard and notify Saurfang the Younger."
2898,"Rifle the Bodies : The Moonrest Gardens to the southwest were the final resting place of a noble group of Highborne elves. It was also a powerful ley line nexus.The blue dragonflight used a magical device they call a surge needle to destroy that nexus, freeing the power to redirect at their will.I need more information and I hope that you will get it for me.After the upheaval at the ruins, the ghosts of the Highborne rose up and decimated half of the mage hunters present. Go rifle their corpses for clues."
2899,"The Black Knight of Westfall? : No doubt you've heard the disturbing rumors about the contestant the others are calling the Black Knight. It's said that any rider who was scheduled to face him in combat has met an untimely end.Of course, we have no definitive proof of anything, but it wouldn't hurt to look into this knight's background.He claims to be descended from the Cooper family of Westfall. Would you visit their residence in the western part of Moonbrook in Westfall? See if you can find any proof of his story."
2900,"In Search of Bigger Game : Well, <name>, you've certainly proven your mettle as a hunter of all kinds of game animals -- rhinos, cats, and crocolisks. For some members of the expedition, these creatures are sufficient to test their hunting skills, but others, like myself, crave larger challenges.Dorian Drakestalker went north, across Bittertide Lake and established a camp there. He's heard rumors of gigantic primordial drakes. Just imagine what a quarry they would be! Go check up on Dorian and see if he's had any luck."
2901,"Guardian of the Smallest : <The oracle pats you on the shoulder, and seems quite pleased with all that you've done.  She holds up one finger, then spreads her hands wide and emits a terrible roar-like murgle.  She points outside, then at you, then your weapon, then nods seriously.  There must be one more trial to await you. It would appear to be a test of strength.>"
2902,"Planning for the Future : We must move decisively against the wolvar if we're to have a chance of survival. However, I worry that in our zeal, too many of them will be slain.The Snowfall Glade wolvar have as much right to exist as do we. You and I will see to it that they get that chance.If Elder Ko'nani hasn't asked you already, he will ask you to deal with them.  While you're upon the glade to the north, I'd like you to bag up their pups and bring them back to me."
2903,"A Hero's Headgear : Rejek hears tales of giant metal men on faraway Stormwright's Shelf. Far to northwest, outside basin's lip, you will find it.Imagine Rejek using heads of giant metal men as helmet. Make Rejek unstoppable! Make Rejek mighty!You get for Rejek, but metal head might not come off metal body easy. Maybe steal bombs from little green men and their friends at Swindlegrin's Dig near Suntouched Pillar? Use bombs to get head off metal body, then bring to Rejek."
2904,"Where in the World is Hemet Nesingwary? : When I heard that the legendary Hemet Nesingwary was setting sail for the Sholazar Basin, I offered to help fund his expedition. We know little of Sholazar,  but it's said to be a lush paradise in the midst of this frozen continent.Hemet has agreed to send back samples of exotic plants, reagents, and crystals.

2906,"Assault by Air : Alright scrub, I've got something to keep you from being a complete waste.A unit of highly trained infiltrators is ready to be dropped inside of Ymirheim. The vrykul inside have automated spear guns that have been ripping our transports to shreds, so we had the engineers on Orgrim's Hammer whip us up a suppression turret.You're the gunner. Launch rounds at their spear guns to obscure their vision and clog their gears. See to it that my men all make their drops and the transport stays in one piece."
2907,"Monitoring the Rift: Winterfin Cavern : I need to compile my notes and prepare a presentation for my colleagues in Dalaran.While I do, I must ask that you visit the Winterfin Cavern to the north. You must use the Arcanometer while standing in the mouth of the cavern.Return to me at once when you have the data. My documentation will be incomplete without it."
2908,"Magic Carpet Ride : Tanks, mon. I be talkin' bout siege machines! We got heavy tanks stationed at Garrosh's Landing on da west coast. We gonna get you to da tank and you gonna use da tank to lay down some Horde justice on da Scourge!Da only tricky part be getting' you der. No way we be sendin' you on our wind riders. Too risky.You see dat pixie o'er der? Dat blondie elf? Yanni be his name, mon. He can get you to da coast, safely. Once der, talk to Annihilator Grek'lor!"
2909,"Still At It : Now that we've got the raw materials, I've had my assistant ready the still. He'll oversee the process, but I want you to help keep everything under control. You might be tempted to think that we just throw everything into the still and let it sit, but you're wrong.Ingredients and heat need to be added at certain times, and the pressure regulated at others. You'll have no more than 10 seconds to react to a situation. Speak with ""Tipsy"" McManus when you're ready to start distilling."
2910,"Nedar, Lord of Rhinos... : West of here, on the high bluffs above Lake Kum'uya, roams a despicable being known as Nedar. The self proclaimed ""Lord of Rhinos"" hunts the wastes for the injured or young - rhinos unable to defend themselves against his cowardly attacks. To add insult to injury, Nedar has raised a rhino of his own to become his mount and bodyguard.It is a rare thing that D.E.H.T.A. would ever call for the death of an animal, but Nedar's tainted rhino must be disposed of... Kill them both and return to me."
2911,"Placing Hodir's Helm : The helm is forged.Your efforts have not gone unnoticed, small one. Though there remains much to do, we sons of Hodir are grateful for your accomplishments.In return, I offer you the opportunity to present Hodir's helm to our king and our brethren.Fly to the sparkling tip of the small ice spike in front of me and read to our people from this tablet.Enjoy the privilege, <class>.

2913,"It Could Be Anywhere! : When I found out that Miss Boulian was helping Nesingwary with his expedition, I signed up as a deckhand immediately.  You see, I'd been meaning to marry her for months!I had it all planned out.  I was going to propose the very night of the shipwreck... but now the ring is gone.  I've searched everywhere!I know it might sound crazy, but I know the engagement ring is in the Basin.  If some Venture Company didn't steal it, maybe a wild creature ate it.  But it's here somewhere... I just know it!"
2914,"The Admiral Revealed : When High General Abbendis was confronted at New Hearthglen, the grand admiral protected himself within an impenetrable sphere of magic before making his escape.I am particularly adept at nullifying magic.Take this to use against him inside The Hidden Hollow when he puts the sphere up.

2915,"The Skybreaker : We were neck deep in Scourge and Horde. The screams of the dying covered that field. It was torturous... unrelenting!At some point my body gave out. I fell, only to be awoken by the Argent Crusade. They pulled me out of the Broken Front and brought me here. I'm not going to make it. Grant a dying soldier one last wish, <race>? Our base, the Skybreaker, flies high above Icecrown. It is there that you'll find my commanding officer, High Captain Bartlett. Tell him that I died a soldier of the Alliance."

Against his will, she has ascended to one of the upper rings of the Nexus to observe some frighteningly powerful blue drakes.Though he will never say it, he worries about her, and would welcome any news of her well-being.Please seek her out. Ask her to put her pride aside and send word to her brother."
2917,"Missing Scouts : There is something that I could use a hand with now that I have you.We have a few scouts that are extremely late in returning. The peaks are harsh... but these boys know what they're doing.Head to the east... along the Bor's Breath valley and near Bor's Fall... they should be out that direction. If you find any sign of one of them, bring me back news immediately. We have a few enemies in the area - if any of them are getting a bit uppity, the more warning the better."
2918,"The Silver Covenant's Scheme : One of my contacts in the Underbelly caught sight of a Silver Covenant agent gathering information at the Cantrips and Crows Tavern. Silver Covenant members aren't normally found in the sewers, so they must be plotting something.Go into the Underbelly, find this Silver Covenant agent, and eliminate him. Search the body for any information that might give us a lead on the location of that tome from Wyrmrest. We can't let those simpering Silver Covenant weaklings get it back to Icecrown before we do."

2989,"Spirits Watch Over Us : Powerful spirits watch over my tribe -- Kaskala will not be lost.Issliruk will give us courage, Tayutka will make sure our survivors always have food and shelter and Karkut will watch over the fallen so they do not lose their way.Issliruk's guidance is the one we need the most right now.  I asked my nephew, Iruk, to bring me Issliruk's totem, but the Kvaldir's spears struck him down and his body fell into the waters to the north.  Bring me the totem, <name>.  Don't let my nephew's death be in vain."
2990,"On Ruby Wings : Use this beacon to signal a Wyrmrest vanquisher. Climb upon its back and fly north to Galakrond's Rest. Once there, command the dragon to destroy the Scourge scavengers that work to unearth Galakrond. Once the area has been cleansed, fly to the Wicked Coil, overlooking Galakrond's Rest, to destroy Grand Necrolord Antiok and recover the scythe that he uses to control the wyrms.Do this and return to Queen Alexstrasza for a hero's reward!<name>, beware the rotting storm giants that wander the area!"
2991,"Song of Fecundity : The storm is a destructive force.  Storm burns trees.  Storm floods houses.But storm can also be life force if you know right song.  In Stormwright Shelf, above Maker's Perch, you can find small dirt mounds.  They very fertile -- they carry inside a strong seed.  All they wait for is the right song.You take this horn and play song for them."
2992,"Too Close For Comfort : I told them all that I remember. Why don't they believe me?I was gathering herbs by the rift. They came from nowhere, dark wizards with magical beasts - I was surrounded!A magical box appeared above me, opened up and pulled me inside. Just as it began to close around me, my rescuers swooped in on the backs of red drakes. It was breathtaking!I never thanked them for saving me. Please, <class>, find them, and pass on my gratitude."
2993,"Jun'ik's Coverup : Ah, we have a small problem.  Grizzly hides... they be brown, mon!Think... think!I got it, mon!  Is like this: gray is black an' white all mixed up.  You get me some coal an' some flour, I'll grind it all up and dust the hides with it.  No one will know the better!Blacksmiths sell coal for smeltin' an' you can get flour from the provisioner."
2994,"A Victory For The Sunreavers : At last, Quel'Delar is restored for the glory of the Sunreavers and the sin'dorei!All of Silvermoon will celebrate you as a hero, <name>.As a <class>, the sword seems to know you lack the training to wield it and hasn't bonded to you. Where, then, will its next master come from? No worthy sin'dorei has come forward. Let us seek the Argent Crusade's counsel. Go north to the Argent Tournament Grounds and present the sword to Justicar Mariel Trueheart on behalf of the Sunreavers."
2995,"The Air Stands Still : You must defeat the lords of Scourgeholme if this place is to be free of the Scourge's grasp.Salranax the Flesh Render lords over the temple on the first tier of Scourgeholme. Nearby Salranax you'll find High Priest Yath'amon preaching at the spirit tower on the second tier. Underking Talonox holds court at the Pit of Fiends, up the high road.These are formidable opponents and must be approached with caution. Use this war horn should you require aid. The death knights of Acherus will come."
2996,"Hatching a Plan : Our goals here are simple. We are to remain hidden from Malygos, observe his brood, and thwart his efforts wherever possible. To that end, I have a task for you.The blues are laying their eggs at the base of the Nexus. Exposure to so much arcane energy will surely make them hatch sooner, and there's no telling what effect it will have on their spawn.I don't intend to find out. Slay the local wyrmkin and use their frozen axes to break the eggs."
2997,"The Aspirant's Challenge : You have trained hard as an aspirant, <name>, and now the time has come to test your mounted combat skills against a skilled opponent.Equip your lance, then go to the stables outside the pavilion and mount up on the stabled Quel'dorei steed.At the Aspirants' Ring on the northern side of the tournament grounds, you'll find Squire David. He'll make certain that you're ready for the fight and call out your opponent.Good luck, <name>. May your horse be steady and your aim true."
2998,"The Clutches of Evil : <name>, I don't trust anyone but you to take care of this.  I need the proto-drake eggs and proto-whelps in the burning forest to the southeast destroyed!Since we arrived here, the Ember Clutch has been ablaze; there must be some sort of perverse magic at work. And lately it seems to be growing. My men tell me that if we don't do something quickly, we'll be surrounded on all sides by the fire within a few weeks' time!Get down there and eliminate the threat by destroying those eggs and the proto-whelps."
2999,"Welcome to Sholazar Basin : So, where did you come from? I don't suppose that fool of an archmage sent you, too?You're lucky to be in one piece, <laddie/lass>! They nearly blew you up!The jungle here's a darned dangerous place, 'specially with the Venture Company about. Git you! Go see the boss... he'll sort you out. The camp's at the end of that path to the northwest.Now, git!"
3000,"Hot and Cold : As you stare at the anvil you relive your recent accomplishments, particularly those which brought this artifact to rest here.It suddenly occurs to you that more remains to be done. To the east, smoldering scraps clutter the landscape--shrapnel from the battle fought there.If they could be cooled and gathered somehow, the frost giants would have an abundant supply of metal and the region would be cleared of these remnants of war."
3001,"Blood in the Water : The forces at Onslaught Harbor are heavily reinforced by gryphon riders. You need a mount that will enable you to put them down. But first, we need the components for the ritual that is going to make it all happen.A great deal of blood is necessary for the ritual to be undertaken.<The lord-commander points down and to the northwest.>There is a readily available supply down there in the harbor... sharks. Do not return to me until you've filled this bladder with their blood."
3002,"Cell Block Tango : The sapper squad is ready. That means it's time for fun!There's only one thing holding us up from our full-scale assault on Garm! I sent a runner to set a teleporter up behind him--successfully I might add--and he returned to get the power cell it needs to function. It isn't working yet... which means the power cell didn't get there.I need you to look just on the other side of Garm's Bane for the power cell. When you find it, bring it farther east to Garm's Rise and activate the teleporter."
3003,Coward Delivery... Under 30 Minutes or it's Free : We're seeing more deserters show up at our gates with each passing day. We simply do not have enough room to keep all of these maggots caged up. Especially not if we want to keep the pigs happy.<Nork snorts as he laughs.>I want you to escort one of these cowards to the crossroads east of here and fire this flare gun. One of their captains will show up when they see the flare and take the coward off your hands.Report to Scout Tungok on the east road once the delivery has been made.
3004,"The Obsidian Dragonshrine : The Scourge come. Korialstrasz calls upon his allies in a futile attempt to save their Ruby Dragonshrine, but it seems the good graces of the red flight don't extend to saving the shrines of the other flights.Surprised? I'm not.There is another of my brood who has left to clear our Obsidian Dragonshrine of the undead vermin that now infest it. All it would take to prove yourself more noble and righteous than Alexstrasza herself is a quick jaunt over there and a few swings of a blade.I'm amused."
3005,"Get the Key : <class>, the key to my shackles is hanging around the neck of Instructor Hroegar outside.Perhaps you could retrieve it by separating his head from his shoulders?"
3006,"Dreadsaber Mastery: Becoming a Predator : If you've hunted with Hemet before, you know that he's tested his skill against many large cats, but the dreadsabers here in Sholazar are different. They're able to bring down larger game than I've ever seen a cat hunt. To overcome and kill such a predator is the mark of a true hunter.If you seek to prove you're up to the challenge, test yourself against the dreadsabers. They live in the wilderness surrounding the camp and south of the river."
3007,"Rhino Mastery: The Test : No rough landing is going to stop ol' Hemet from mastering the largest game Sholazar has to offer. In the wilds northwest of the camp, the jungles are ruled by the mighty shardhorn rhino. You can prove your worth to the expedition, <lad/lass>, by showing me that you're tough enough to face down those powerful beasts."
3008,"A Cold Front Approaches : The chill of death stirs in the west, threatening to freeze our hearts and souls to this wasteland and bind us to its dark master. We will stand and we will fight!The preparations have begun. Report to Siegemaster Fezzik at the front gate for your assignment."
3009,"The Shining Light : <Ares gasps for air as he tries to speak.>I am an envoy of the Argent Crusade, charged with a sacred duty.Our forces were decimated in the Plaguelands. By the light of dawn, the artifact was cleansed and made pure once more. So many perished in the wake of its redemption.There is still a chance... still time.The artifact was hurled into the den of the fallen, far below us. Guarded by the unmerciful dead.<Ares' body glows with blinding light.>Light. Will. Protect. You."
3010,"Fortunate Misunderstandings : I sorry! I not mean to get you in trouble!<The injured oracle stares at you blankly for a long while.>You save me! We thank you. We going to go back to village now. You come too... you can stay with us! Puppy-men kind of mean anyway.Let me know when you ready to go, okay?"
3011,"A Hero Remains : I know why you've come... they've sent you to bring me back, but that cannot happen. I carry the plague of undeath, <class>, and I'll not share my fate with those near me. No, I shall stay here.My only regret lies in what I may become when death grips me. I do not fear death itself, but I loathe to consider serving the traitor, Arthas.Leave me... and see to it that no one else comes looking. You would do me a great disservice if you were to expose anyone to the plague that I carry."
3012,"Death's Gaze : The Fleshwerks is a vast operation, and it will be difficult to keep an eye on all that transpires there. Fortunately, I have a plan.<Arly produces an orb from the folds of her cloak and shows it to you.>This is a death's gaze orb. With it, we can observe the Scourge's actions and decide how best to strike.Place these orbs on the stands at three crucial areas -- the abomination lab and the flesh giant lab to the southwest, along with the area surrounding the green cauldron far to the west."
3013,"Atop the Woodlands : I'm convinced that there must be more of those foci, each of them in-turn redirecting the ley line energies. We still don't know precisely what they're doing with all of that power, though.My guess is that you'll find another one atop the Lothalor Woodlands to the south. Once again you'll need to find the person in charge and take whatever controlling device they have in their possession as I'm sure that each focus has its own.Be quick about your business, <class>. I feel that time may be running out."
3014,"Swabbin' Soap : Yeah, I got to get the deck swabbed spotless afore Mad Jonah comes 'round. An' I ain't gonna do it on my hands and knees neither!Problem is, we're all outa soap. That's more your problem than mine though, mate. Being the newbie 'round here, I gots a special trip for ya to make.Up on the northwest coast of this island, there's a whole mess o' sea lions. Amongst the nearby ice floes you'll find the alpha bull, Big Roy. Bring me back his blubber and I'll magic-up the best soap ya ever seen!"
3015,"Leave Nothing to Chance : If there is good in your heart and your conscience is clear, read on.In this mine, near the foreman's scaffold, rests a hefty cargo of dynamite. Go there and pick up several bundles of the explosive and make your way towards the entrance of the mine. Once there, set the dynamite and blow up the entrance. Remember to do this for the upper and lower entry points of Wintergarde Mine.You must leave nothing to chance. The evil that exists here must never be allowed out. Light guide you."
3016,"The Fate of Bloodbane : With the riders of the Host of Suffering dead, now is the time to put an end to their true leader: Orbaz Bloodbane.Mograine caught up with me while you were off and told me that he found where Orbaz is hiding. Under Icecrown Citadel itself, there is an immense pit - you will find Orbaz just outside its lip.Some of the Ebon Blade's strongest agents have already been dispatched - gather aid and join the fight. It is time for Bloodbane to die."
3017,"Lightning Definitely Strikes Twice : Okay, the crystal things...The big-tongues use the crystals to power their rain shrines. Zepik not know quite how it works, but Zepik does know that if they use wrong crystals, the clouds and the rain go crazy!Zepik tried to sneak in at one of their other rain shrines, but it not go so well. It sure to go much better with two!Take crystals, place at big stone pillar shrine thing, then smash them to release power. Zepik not sure what will happen, so might want to step back after."
3018,"News From the East : Westguard needs to know what's going on here, <name>. I want you to personally deliver the news to Captain Adams.Whenever you're ready, let me know and I'll put you back in the construct for one final flight. It'll take you to Westguard Keep, but more than likely blow up in the process.It's been a pleasure..."
3019,"Surrender... Not! : The time has come to put an end to this unnatural situation, <name>. For the Winterfin murlocs to have a chance at a future, Claximus must die!I want you to take my spare murloc suit and enter the Winterfin Caverns under the pretext of surrender. With the white flag in hand, the murlocs won't attack you.You'll find him in the southwestern most corner of the caverns. Once you get close enough, deal with Claximus. Bring me one of his claws as proof that the grisly deed has been done."
3020,"Generosity Abounds : We need to cause some disruption to bring those death knights away from their leaders. If we lay waste to their minions below, I suspect they'll have to devote more attention to keeping a close eye on operations.Abominations are easy prey - slow, predictable, and most importantly, stupid. Take advantage of their trust of the stalkers to drag them near some of the Scourge bombs scattered throughout the construction area. You'll be able to light the bombs far before they figure out what's going on."
3021,"A Rough Ride : Zepik is best hunter of the Frenzyheart. Zepik hunts big-tongues... ugly things near swamps that try to steal all stuff they can find.Zepik going on long trek to break big-tongue shrine and try to scare them away. We no want big-tongues in this land anymore.There a crocolisk chained on northeast side of hill, next to tree - go with Zepik and do what Zepik tell you."
3022,"I Have an Idea, But First... : When I was in the - ahem - employ of the Lich King, we would often use a device known as a sovereign rod to keep some of the more intelligent Scourge in line.I require that you assist me in the construction of a new one.Luckily for you, all of the necessary components are at hand: a cultist rod, an abomination hook, a geist rope, and a handful of Scourge essences.This should not be difficult, <class>."
3023,"I've Got a Flying Machine! : Well, what are you waiting for, there's work to be done!Here's the keys to our flying machine. Grab three sacks of relics and haul them up to the crane platforms on the north and south sides of Steel Gate.  I'll mark them for you.Hurry up! We haven't got all day!"
3024,"Hope Yet Remains : <Bridenbrad raises a hand to you as he catches his breath.>It was nearly as painful as it looked, but it was as if I could feel some of the corruption being burnt away from within my body. It seems the plague is not so readily bested though.<class>, thank you for everything that you have done. Your selfless actions have renewed my hope that there is yet great good left within this world - I can depart without fear that darkness will prevail in my absence.Go now, go with no regrets."
3025,Glimmerfin Scale : <A brightly-colored scale fell to the ground as the murloc ran off. It was unlike any other murloc you've seen in Northrend.  Perhaps King Mrgl-Mrgl would know more about this new species?>
3026,"Seared Scourge : <Hic>... gotta burn these corpshes 'fore they shtart walkin' around again.Poppa always said, only thing worshe than havin' to kill a troll is havin' ta kill a troll twice.Say,<hic>... shpeakin' of Scourge, we can't get into tha' troll keep up north 'til we get them trolls thinned out a bit.How 'bout ya take shome o my grog here and put them bashtards outta their misery?"
3027,"Convocation at Zol'Heb : You must take this instrument of convocation - of summoning - to Zol'Heb just south of Gundrak.Therein you will find a circle of power. Use the convocation to force the prophet of Akali to appear.My heart goes out to you, <name>. We have been through much together, and you have done all that you can to not only save my life, but those of the other gods the Drakkari have destroyed.But I fear this time we may not see each other again until the afterlife."
3028,"The Leaders at Jin'Alai : You thinkin' what Ahunae thinkin', mon?Some of the Drakkari trolls have gathered at the Pools of Jin'Alai to the southwest. We be needin' to draw out their leaders, and Ahunae knows just how you be doin' it, too!Go in there and kill those trolls. When you kill enough, their leaders show up.When they show up next to their totems, you make sure to be gettin' the treasure of Kutube'sa, Gawanil, and Chulo the Mad, mon."
3029,"Parting Gifts : Look what we have here... eyes of dominion. The Cult normally goes to great lengths to keep these things safe, but I suppose their options for retreat are few when we're slaughtering them in their own home.The eyes allow a being of any relative power to control an undead minion's actions precisely. As you can imagine, this can be extremely useful when it comes to your typical clumsy ghoul or skeleton.Care to try your hand at it? Use one of the eyes to control a captured shade."
3030,"Kaganishu : After my small force of grunts were killed, I was dragged down here and ritually murdered. The snobold who did this is known as Kaganishu.Though you have vanquished his shaman helpers, my spirit is still tethered to this place. After he slew me, he created a fetish from my body, which anchors me here. Kaganishu is using it to learn all that I know of shamanism.You must retrieve the fetish from him and use it upon my spirit. Kaganishu is nearby in the caves.Only then will I truly be free."
3031,"Into The Frozen Heart Of Northrend : Silas and Spitzpatrick have signed off on the materials and fuel needed to begin construction of Justice Keep. Thanks to you and the Ebon Blade the Scourge presence within Scourgeholme has been decimated and their lieutenants have been defeated.I have chosen the site at which we will break ground, but first you must deliver my report to Highlord Tirion Fordring. We will begin our march into Icecrown on his command."
3032,"Scourgekabob : Ugh.Wrappin' up these unfortunate trolls be makin' my heart ache, but not so much as my back!Help ol' Prigmon out and haul one of these carcasses over to Mack.If we don't burn 'em they be walkin' again in no time."
3033,"Pa'Troll : Welcome to The Argent Stand, scrub. I am Commander Kunz, but you - you can call me... Commander.Don't think you're going to just cruise through my region, picking which missions you're going to participate in, answering to no one.Here, you report to me and you follow my orders to the letter. Understood?!First, you're going to get familiar with my men and the region we're charged with clearing.Report to each of them and do as they ask. Return to me when your patrol is done."
3034,"The Black Knight's Fate : You said the body was taken by cultists? I can only think of one place they would have gone, Deathspeaker's Watch, the encampment on the rise west of the tournament grounds.Whatever the cultists are doing must be stopped. The rumors I've heard can only be true, then. The infamous Doctor Kohler must be among the cultists, practicing his arts. Look for a rise or an altar overlooking the cultist camp, slay the doctor, and look for proof of his plans. Slow down his work in any other way you can."
3035,"So Far, So Bad : Everything you've reported is consistent with what we know. Learning of Drakuru and earning his trust will lay the groundwork for your future missions.Return to him and do as he says. Do whatever you must to appear sincere, <name>. A great deal is riding upon your performance.This time I'm adding an additional assignment: While you're in the field, pour this additive into their blight cauldrons. It should neutralize the scourging agent and render the batch useless."
3036,"Finding the Phylactery : No time for small talk, <name>.  I was sent on what was to be a suicide mission to take this ziggurat.  I've accomplished my duty as a soldier, now is the time to get some answers.This lich has knowledge I seek, yet I cannot inflict pain to his physical body to obtain that knowledge.The lich stored his soul in a phylactery, and while it remains hidden, I won't be able to pry the information from him.Return to the camp and take my horse, Dusk, she will lead you to the phylactery.  Bring it to me."
3037,"Flight of the Wintergarde Defender : With this whistle you can call down a Wintergarde gryphon. Mount the creature and head towards the ruins of Wintergarde Village, now known as the Carrion Fields, southeast of here. Once at the fields, keep your eyes peeled for helpless Wintergarde villagers. When you spot one, fly low and use the gryphon to pick them up. Return the rescued villager here, to the gryphon station.There are Scourge all over the place so you'll need to keep your wits about you, hero. Good luck!"
3038,"The Plains of Nasam : Once you're ready, jump into one of the tanks and drive it out to the Plains of Nasam, southeast of here.Use the tank's weapon arsenal to take down the Scourge army. If you get in a jam, the ""Meatpounder"" will tear 'em up and the land mines will finish 'em off! If you find any of our soldiers, grab 'em! One last thing, fuel tanks can be found all over the field.Try to get close enough to that structure in the center and see what's going on.If you do all of this and live, go to Hellscream!"
3039,"The Art of Being a Water Terror : The water lock outside my cave is teeming with elementals that the vrykul magi have yet to tame. I am going to teach you a trick for possessing these creatures for a short time, and you will use them to wreak havoc upon Jotunheim!<The banshee-infested vrykul draws magic in the air and touches a large finger to your forehead.>Go now and open the gate to the lock. A water terror will rush out and you will possess it to destroy our enemies!"
3040,"Ancient Relics : Welcome to the peaks.I have a simple request before you head off on whatever grand jaunt you have planned. There are relics and treasures of ancient Ulduar scattered through these mountains. Most are likely in possession of the various sentient races.Return any that you find to me, and I will reward you in kind. Perhaps I'll even let you partake on my many potent ales."
3041,"Learning to Leave and Return: the Magical Way : Just in case you don't already know, you can use the crystal on the platform behind me to teleport to the Violet Stand in Crystalsong Forest beneath Dalaran.Correspondingly, you can use the crystal at the stand below to return to the chamber above me.I would like for you to do this now."
3042,"In Service to the Light : Your service has been exemplary, <name>, but there is something that is troubling me: the Scourge.The Light cannot abide their presence, and neither shall we. I hope that it is not asking you too much, but I would have you return north to Gjalerbron and crush the unholy Scourge in that vile lair! Be sure to check for them in the Waking Halls beneath Gjalerbron as well.Purification is the key to salvation, my child. Make us proud!"
3043,"No Rest For The Wicked : These fools have actually stumbled upon something that could pose a serious threat to our plans!The leader of this particular sect, Alumeth, has ritualistically sacrificed himself and now his underlings are channeling power to his soul.If he's allowed to rest, their efforts will soon transform him into a mighty adversary.Combine his heart, skull, scepter and robes from around their chamber and use his remains on the crystal there.Hurry, <race>! Destroy him before he becomes any more powerful!"
3044,"Heart of the Ancients : Secrets of da ages, be revealed to me now!<Drakuru peers through the Eye of the Prophets.>Ahh, great be mah destiny, <name>. You be lucky ta know me....There! I be seein' it, mon. The Heart of the Ancients. Dis be too easy!You gunna find da heart lyin' near da corpse of a goblin east of here. He be up in a chamber, near a river of broken trees.Hurry, mon, before someone else be findin' it!"
3045,"Dun-da-Dun-tah! : Listen, kid. This is no place for you to be playin' around.I'm about to make a break for it. Stick with me and I'll get you outta here."
3046,"A Means to an End : I received a few barrels of termites from my sister at the Bulwark back home in the last shipment. I think they're going to come in handy for something I have in mind for you.The lumbermill operations at New Hearthglen are problematic for us, but so far we haven't been able to get anyone in there to take out their foreman.I think that if you were to unleash these termites on his precious woodworks, he'd be sure to come running.Ready to take him out, <class>?"
3047,"A Fall From Grace : We need more information from the high abbot, and now that we have the visage of one of the raven priests, I think we can get you close to talk with him.Unfortunately, we need to separate him from his bodyguards or you'll never get any information out of him.<The agent leans on her shovel and thinks a moment.>I think I've got it! While in disguise, go to the top of the abbey and ring the bell. That should bring the abbot's bodyguards running and you can then head down to speak with him."
3048,"The Mist Isn't Listening : Gorillas and wasps are boring! Big-tongues the only thing fun to hunt.While we mess up rain shrine, we kill lots of mist big-tongues. That sure to make them not want to come back to village thing.<Zepik nods to himself confidently.>"
3049,"Stunning View : Gargoyles make effective scouts and can be deadly if left to rain attacks from the air, but they have a very obvious weakness. Most of them have to go through long periods resting as stone to maintain the energy they need to carry their heavy bodies through the air.As I peered through the eye you were using, I noticed dozens of iceskin sentries resting on the eastern and southern walls inside. Use the stalker to leap up to their ledges and devastate them while they sleep."
3050,"Examples to be Made : For every action there is an opposite reaction, sister.  In the case of us applying pressure on the males, this has meant newly spread rumors of insurrection.The bearded pig behind this rabble-rousing is called Garhal.  Put an end to him... and make sure the other males see his demise.  They must learn that insubordination will not be tolerated."
3051,"Street ""Cred"" : The Northsea Freebooters all fear and respect Grezzix. I'm thinking they recognize my special talents and envy my amazing ship. All you need to do is tag along with my cabin boy, Lou, and you'll be in like... In like tin. Pirates love tin.Just talk to Lou when you're ready to go and he'll take you to Scalawag.Oh yea, you'll want to talk to ""Silvermoon"" Harry first. He'll have more information on the stuff they pilfered. Just watch what you say around him. He's a freak... crazy for blood elves."
3052,"Learning to Communicate : To help, you must learn how to speak the Winterfin dialect. We'll work with the forces of nature and magic to do that.Take this empty conch shell. At the bottom of the watery trench below exists Scalder, an elemental of air and watery fury.Once she is defeated, use the conch upon her remains to capture her magical steam. Return the full conch to me, and I'll imbue my knowledge of the Winterfin tongue into you.Luckily, a friend taught me a water breathing spell, which I will cast upon you."
3053,"The Conqueror's Task : The Horde is a magnificent war machine and you are nothing but a cog.I am in charge of securing fuel for this machine.  If I fail, the machine fails.Lumber, ore, water... it's all here and we want it.  And so does the Alliance.Before we can move against the human scum, we need to solidify our control over the western region.Speak to Sergeant Nazgrim about eradicating the vrykul in Voldrune and then maybe - if you turn out to not be a complete failure - we'll send you on further tasks."
3054,"The Ebon Watch : West of here, across the ruined roads and structures, is the death knight encampment of Ebon Watch.<Crusader Lord Lantinga rolls up Drakuru's orders.>Take these orders and deliver them to Stefan Vadu. He is the death knight in command at Ebon Watch. Let him know that the Argent Crusade will deal with Prince Navarius. They'll have to handle Drakuru.Be careful, <name>. The way to Ebon Watch is teeming with Scourge."
3055,"Sarathstra, Scourge of the North : Me hunters be dead or frozen, <name>. You still want to do dis? Just say da word and me call for da dragon once more.If ya kill it, take da beast's frozen heart back to Agmar's Hammer and present it to Gort. He sure to reward you good, mon."
3056,"Slaves of the Stormforged : To the southwest, on the western side of the Snowdrift Plains, the iron dwarves have dug a mine into the hillside. There, they use captive mechagnomes, servants of Keeper Mimir, to mine ore.I don't know where these mechagnomes came from, nor what they would do with their freedom, but perhaps we can win their help.Go to the Frozen Mine, <name>, and set these creatures free from their bondage. Ask if they would fight alongside us against iron dwarf tyranny."
3057,"Battling the Elements : Snorri was once the pride of our nation. A mighty warrior, many an enemy fell to his club.We honor him, though he's no longer what he once was. Age has taken its toll, dulling his senses and sapping his strength. Still, he remains as proud as ever, never missing an opportunity to join a battle.Speaking of battle, we're cooling Fjorn's anvil so it can be taken home. The remaining fire revenants are putting up some resistance. Help Snorri relive his glory days, <race>. Guide him against this enemy."
3058,"Up To The Challenge : When you have mastered the skills of the aspirant, you may choose to take the aspirant's challenge. The challenge will test your mounted combat skills and assess whether or not you're prepared to become a valiant. Should you pass, you will be able to join your capital city's delegation as a valiant.When you are ready to begin the challenge, return to me."
3059,"The Cell : You've discovered a fragment of a special prison, <name>.Malygos' minions use similar prisons to hold their captured mages and other arcane entities, but this prison was constructed to hold something... stronger.In hopes that the enemy of our enemy will prove to be a friend, you must search for the prison's remaining fragments.They are likely to be in the possession of Malygos' most trusted underlings."
3060,Vile Like Fire! : Vile like fire! Vile like proto-drakes!<The abomination claps its hands excitedly.>Little <name> go to Jotunheim and steal a pretty proto-drake in Njorndar Village. Make proto-drake make pretty fires on Jotunheim buildings!
3061,"The High Cultist : I have dreamed of Zangus before but without the context that you have discovered, I knew not what it meant. You have brought clarity to the vision that the goddess has bestowed upon me, and now I know that he can be found within the Pit of Narjun to the north.You know your target, <name>. If there's to be an end to the suffering of the land, the high cultist must die!"
3062,"Deemed Worthy : You have succeeded where many have failed, sister. Whether it be by strength and courage or mere luck remains to be seen.Go back to the village and seek out Astrid Bjornrittar. Tell her of your accomplishments. But be warned. She is not easily impressed."
3063,"Kickin' Nass and Takin' Manes : Before you meet Nass, there's something you should know.He got a toxic dose of blight back in the day, and now he's deaf, blind, and mostly numb.It's not all bad, though. He's virtually immune to the stuff now, which makes him perfect for certain tasks - like the one I'm about to give you.There are many freshly scourged trolls nearby and we need to study the blight's effect on them. Take Nass, and this boot. When you've slain a troll, give him a good kick and he'll know to take a hair sample."
3064,"You'll Need a Bear : You've succeeded in the first rounds of the Hyldsmeet.  To advance further, you're going to need a warbear of your own.Unfortunately, the Hyldnir don't give them out to just anyone.  You'll have to emerge victorious from true battle, not just gladiatorial combat.The Hyldnir of Brunnhildar are currently involved in a feud against the Sons of Hodir, Thorim's former allies.  Speak to Brijana just outside the village and see how you can help them and prove yourself in the process."
3065,"Defending The Vanguard : We can't keep this pace up, <lad/lass>. Once the breach was blown, the floodgates opened up. The Scourge have been pourin' through ever since with no end in sight!We need every able bodied man and woman to help keep the tide of evil at bay. Get out there and do yer share, friend. Kill as many of those monsters as ye can!"
3066,"Forging Hodir's Spear : The time has come, little <class>. The stars have foretold of this day.I have received a vision from mighty Hodir himself, revealing the secret to the creation of a great artifact.We must obey! Were we to fail in receiving this gift, doom would surely follow.I call upon you to assist me in this sacred undertaking.Go across the valley, deep into the Hibernal Cavern and gather everfrost shards from the icy crater there, then collect hides from the mammoths outside the cavern."
3067,"Prison Break : Greetings, <class>. I am Donathan, a loyal representative of Dalaran.Forgive my abruptness, but we find ourselves in the midst of a crisis. Mages all across Azeroth are being abducted and I have been authorized to conscript anyone able to assist in the unraveling of this mystery.The camp just south of ours is where our investigation begins. I call upon you to rescue one of the imprisoned mages held there. You must obtain a key from one of the mage hunters and use it to open an arcane prison."
3068,"The Grand (Admiral's) Plan : At first this note looks like any of the other intel that you've been looking for. However, a quick perusal of its contents disabuses you of this notion.The letter conveys that Grand Admiral Westwind is present somewhere on the island, but that he is keeping himself secluded for now. He speaks of a glorious day that is coming soon in which the Scarlet Onslaught will wash over first the Lich King and then the rest of world to finally bring order to Azeroth.The lord-commander will want to see this!"
3069,"Jagged Shards : You pulled this jagged, dark brittle shard from the body of a ghoul. The metal blade lacks a smooth edge, suggesting it was forged by an unskilled hand, or was broken from a larger piece.You recall seeing similar shards embedded in the bodies of all the ghouls you've encountered at the Fleshwerks, leading you to wonder why their creators bothered to include the metal at all. Perhaps Crusader Olakin Sainrith would have some insight if you brought him the shards from several ghouls."
3070,"Dragonflayer Battle Plans : While we were able to gather very little information as to the whereabouts of Ingvar, we do know that Yanis resides in a cave next to the worg pit inside Wyrmskull Village.Intelligence gathered from the rescued soldiers indicates that Yanis guards Dragonflayer battle plans.I need you to go back to Wyrmskull and recover those plans. Kill any vrykul that get in your way - including Yanis!"
3071,"Iron Rune Constructs and You: Collecting Data : The most important part of your job while controlling the construct is the collection of data. I've placed an iron dwarf relic in the cart over yonder. It's the floating, lightning infused crystal.Get on the work bench and I'll put you back in the construct. Once you're back in the driver's seat, use the construct's data collection ability to pick up the test data."
3072,"Powering the Waygate - The Makers' Overlook : We cannot stop now, <race>.  You've triggered the first switch, but one remains.The titans constructed a second vantage point where they oversaw their creations.  You'll find it to the east, high in the mountains.Pull the activation switch theta inside the overlook and the waygate will open."
3073,"The Unstable Prism : As the prism struggles to stabilize in a single time flow, it bleeds a shadowy chill, the likes of which you haven't felt since Northrend. Surely some mage in Dalaran would be interested in this relic."
3074,"Hope Within the Emerald Nightmare : What we need exists only in the emerald dream... acorns that are infused with a powerful restorative magic. Many places in this sacred glade are closely tied with the dream, and my shrine is among them.I will send you into the dream to recover some of these acorns. Be prepared though <class>, for this method of entering the dream is dangerous, and it is very likely you will be beset by nightmares.Recover a few acorns quickly, and then depart from my shrine or pinch yourself to return to our world."
3075,"Judgment Day Comes! : We cannot defeat the Lich King on our own. Divided we shall all fall!I implore you answer the call, <brother/sister>. The Argent Crusade accepts all that would volunteer to aid in the war effort. Highlord Tirion Fordring himself awaits you at the Argent Vanguard! Get upon your mount and fly to the southeastern reaches of Icecrown. It is there that you will find Lord Fordring and the soldiers of the Argent Crusade.Go now, <class>, for judgment day comes!"
3076,"Kick, What Kick? : So you think you can shoot?Well, let's give it a try. Here, we'll start you out with something nice and gentle. Don't worry, it's got no kick to it at all. Remember, don't point that gun at anything you don't intend to fire at.Now, when you're ready, just take aim at that apple on top o' old Lucky Wilhelm's head and let 'er fly!"
3077,"Hour of the Worg : It is time, then, <name>.  Arugal must be defeated.Get a couple of people you can trust and head for Bloodmoon Isle.  It's just off the coast, east of here.We'll hit them fast.  Take out Arugal's lieutenants -- I'll catch up with you when it's time to take out the monster himself."
3078,"Victory in Wintergrasp : Commander Zanneth might be satisfied with a pile of Horde corpses at his feet, but controlling Wintergrasp is of the utmost importance to the Valiance Expedition. Make sure it remains in our control.However, don't think we'll just let you stand around while your allies do your dirty work for you. If you're not at least a second level recruit by the end of the battle, don't come back."
3079,"The Boon of A'dal : I am pleased that you have come to me, <name>. I know of Crusader Bridenbrad, and of your travels in hope of saving him. Bridenbrad's valor has sparked remarkable selflessness in you, and this is a miracle unto itself.The Light will take care of its own. I will extend my blessing to Bridenbrad and he shall not endure the corruption of undeath. I shall return you to Dalaran, and you shall return to him. Know that I remain with you."
3080,"The Forsaken Blight : I have prepared a package that must be delivered to Doctor Sintar Malefious at Agmar's Hammer. The contents of the package include the final blight specimen along with instructions on preparation and samples of the reactive agent.You will find Agmar's Hammer in western Dragonblight. Just look for the black, jagged metal orc buildings - that will be Agmar's Hammer."
3081,"Rallying the Troops : The sons of iron have used their runes to enthrall many of my brothers and are using them to break the siege on Thor Modan. I wish we did not have to fight them, but we have no choice.My giants will not hold out long against them.I have imbued this earthen shard with a blessing that will aid our allies. Take it with you to the battle in the Boulder Hills to the north, and use it to reassure and fortify my brethren.Kill any iron dwarves who would stand in your way."
3082,"Escape from the Winterfin Caverns : The lock on my cage doesn't look too solid, but I'm not foolish enough to try to leave without assistance.Will you help me safely get out of these caverns? There's no time to waste, <race>.When you get back to the retreat, please let the king know that I'm okay. He's sure to give you a reward."
3083,"The Focus on the Beach : The mage hunter forces are active on the Glittering Strand to the south of Moonrest Gardens. My guess is that you'll find a heavily guarded focus on the beach and a captain who is in charge of it.No doubt the captain of the force down there will have some sort of controlling device on their person. Get the controller and use it on the focus.With any skill on your part, we'll be able to get some more information about what they're really up to out there."
3084,"An Issue of Trust : This should never have happened.  The forces of undeath storm the very cradle of life!If you're not here to destroy the minions of the Lich King, then leave at once.  Do not incur my wrath by distracting me from my duties."
3085,"Through the Eye : We must use the Lich King's tools against him if we are to decide our next step.Over the mountain to the southwest lies Kul'galar Keep. Within it reside the oracles of Jotunheim who receive orders from their master and scry upon others through the Eye of the Lich King.It is the eye that you must fight your way to. While it cannot be used to pierce the veil within Icecrown Citadel, you should be able to use it to discern something of value so that we will know how best to proceed."
3086,"The Thane of Voldrune : Now that you've captured the flame-imbued talismans and weakened Voldrune's defenses, we can strike at its leader, Thane Torvald Eriksson.The thane's favorite mount is an unruly proto-drake he calls Flamebringer. It is kept bound in chains in the western part of Voldrune, but with the talismans, you should be able to control it long enough to use it against the thane.Once you have Flamebringer under your control, search the tops of the towers of Voldrune for the thane and show him no mercy."
3087,"The Fall of Taunka'le Village : We are lost, <name>. This place has been our home for many generations, but it is no longer safe. There remains only death... Death and a memory of what used to be.I have called for the evacuation of Taunka'le. All remaining taunka must leave at once and make their way to our capital city, Icemist, located in the Dragonblight.<Wintergale points east.>You must help get my people to safety, <name>. Mother Tauranook awaits you at the village gates. Hurry! The Scourge closes in from all sides!"
3088,"See You on the Other Side : These Drakkari have met you with nothing but savage hostility. You owe them nothing. Few indeed would carry out the task that Kraz asks of you today.To cleanse this place and send the spirits to their eternal rest, you must join them in death.There is one inside the crypt who awaits you - on the other side. He holds the knowledge we seek, <name>.Use the mallet on the gongs. The spirit of he who corrupts this place will surely deliver you to the spirit world.Kraz awaits your return."
3089,"Adding Injury to Insult : The vrykul are being clever about this.  Fortunately I've a trick up my sleeve.This leader of theirs, Bjorn, is a real hothead.  We've pieced together enough of their language to fashion what we think is a good insult.  Something involving his mother and large barnyard animals... we're not quite sure.Take this piece of paper and read it to him.  Once he starts chasing you, lure him back here.  We'll make sure he doesn't make it out alive."
3090,"Trust is Earned : The first and most important factor in falconry is the bond between the falconer and <his/her> bird. Trust must be earned by the master!<Hidalgo points to the falcons in the cage at his feet.>If you are to earn their trust you will first need to fill their bellies.The fjord rock falcon, as these birds are known, primarily eat grubs. Throughout the fjord you will find loose rocks that serve as breeding grounds for these grubs. Find a grub and return here to feed the falcons in the cage."
3091,"Raining Down Destruction : Beneath us is iron's ancient bastion, Thor Modan. Thousands of years ago, the stone giants tore the land asunder, collapsing part of the city and exposing much of the rest.Even now, the iron dwarves attempt to reclaim their old capital, but we will not permit it. My giants fill the trench with boulders and debris, hoping to seal it off and kill the servants of iron as they work. Take up the boulders you see near the trench to the northeast, and help us put an end to their efforts."
3092,"Mastery Of Melee : The heart of tournament competition is mounted melee combat. Take this lance and mount the stabled Sunreaver hawkstrider just outside the pavilion.Once you're mounted, seek out Jeran Lockwood. He's on the northern edge of the tournament grounds at the training area east of the Aspirants' Ring. Jeran will instruct you on how to use your defenses to keep you safe while attacking a melee target at close range."
3093,"The Valiant's Charge : In your training as a valiant, you'll have the chance to test your skills against valiants representing other cities. Although a valiant's battles are not a formal part of the competition, you will learn valuable lessons about the fighting styles and weaknesses of your opponents.The valiants are a spirited lot, competing amongst themselves for honor and notoriety.Train as a valiant until you are confident of your ability to best all who face you, then bring me the seals you have earned."
3094,"Forgotten Treasure : I've made my fortune by specializing in treasure that regular pirates don't appreciate: art, antiquities, collector's pieces.Black Conrad's fleet sank south of here years ago.  All the gold and jewelry was picked clean by divers, but two ancient relics remain there.  One is a museum-quality Amani vase, the other is an eagle figurine.Go and retrieve them for me and I'll vouch for you with the other pirates.  I'll even throw in something to make your underwater adventure a bit more manageable."
3095,"Nick of Time : I told them all that I remember. Why don't they believe me?I was gathering herbs by the rift. They came from nowhere, dark wizards with magical beasts. I was surrounded!A huge magical cube appeared above me. It opened up and pulled me inside. I swear it's true!Just as it began to close around me, my rescuers swooped in on the backs of drakes - It was amazing! My captors scattered and I was able to escape.I never thanked them for saving me. Please, <class>, if you see them, pass on my gratitude."
3096,"Intelligence Gathering : I need to know what the Scarlet Onslaught is planning today. You will be my instrument in this task.Fly to Onslaught Harbor and rifle through their baggage trunks for documents. The trunks will be locked, so you'll have to take the keys from the Scarlet Onslaught members by whatever means."
3097,"The Amphitheater of Anguish: Korrak the Bloodrager! : You're not gonna believe this, pal. Your next fight is against Korrak the Bloodrager! Looks like the Drakkari trolls are pulling a power play! And let me tell you, buddy, he's been sippin' the animal god juice. He's good and ready to pound you into the ground.Are you ready?"
3098,"The Ape Hunter's Slave : You think you so great hunter, eh? You no Frenzyheart, you not know of hunt.Goregek is great ape hunter. He slay so many ape you can't count on claws.You go with Goregek and hunt hardknuckles to east. You the slave, <race>. You do what Goregek tell you."
3099,"The Great Hunter's Challenge : So y'have something of a hunter's instinct. You're not a bad shot, and Hemet hasn't driven you out, so he must be planning on including you in the hunt.How'd you like to have a bit of a competition, just me and you?Hemet and the others will ask you to help in their hunting. Along the way, you and I will count up the kills we contribute to their goals. Now, this isn't something you can win in the blink of an eye, and you'll find yourself killing many different kinds of creatures. Good luck!"
3100,"A Mammoth Undertaking : Before you go off challenging Broodmother Slivina, Dorian thought it might be a good idea for you and Hemet to coordinate your efforts by riding into battle on the back of a mammoth.The area around the camp is full of them. Just take this bridle and slip it over the head of a shattertusk mammoth. Be careful of the bulls, though. They won't tolerate the harness at all. Bring the mammoth back here when you've found a suitable one."
3101,"If There Are Survivors... : Across the Valley of Echoes, west of here, and through the Breach, is the first Scourge encampment in Icecrown known as Scourgeholme. We fought a good fight at Scourgeholme and killed many Scourge, but in the end we were forced to retreat. Many soldiers were left behind - their fate unknown.If there are survivors, we must attempt a rescue. Directly down this southeastern path is Penumbrius, ally of the bronze dragonflight and caretaker of the proto-brood. Seek him out and ask for his assistance."
3102,"An Undead's Best Friend : As is usual practice, the undead at the saronite quarry to the southwest starve plaguehounds to keep them extra aggressive. Use the shade to get up close and feed some of those hounds and I promise you they'll be content to leave you alone, if not side with the hand that fed them.Don't get too close to those things until you've fed them though. Their noses don't fall victim to your shade's elusiveness."
3103,The Gods Have Spoken : The gods have spoken and we must heed their wisdom.Travel north to Zim'Rhuk to destroy guardians there until they yield the unblemished heart. Travel east to the Altar of Quetz'lun and disrupt the altar wardens until you recover their gusty essence.Deliver both to Har'koa and she will combine them into that which will compel late Akali's prophet to appear.
3104,"Zero Tolerance : Ignorance! Dis be intolerable, mon! My entire batch of blight be useless!Dat mongrel, Darmuk! He be responsible for watchin over da blight. He failed me, mon!Dis be a good lesson for ya, <name>. Failure be like a disease dat spreads. Ya gotta catch it and kill it early, before it be killin' you!Take dis scepter. It make my scourged trolls stronger. Use dem ta kill Darmuk. He be lurkin' down below just to da south.Let dat be an example to all, mon. Don't be failin' Drakuru!"
3105,"Projections and Plans : This is a teleportation device. If I had to guess, I'd say that it leads to the surge needle platform floating above the Moonrest Gardens to the southwest.<name>, I need you to use it to investigate what's up there. It appears that the device works both ways so you shouldn't have to jump off.I expect that once you teleport up to the top of the surge needle, there will be some sort of apparatus on it to observe.You should be able to use the teleporter from anywhere within the gardens."
3106,Mission: Plague This! : The Royal Apothecary Society thinks they're going to perfect a new plague to melt us down where we stand?!Not on my watch!Get out to the courtyard and speak with Greer Orehammer. He's got a gryphon and some bombs ready for you. I want you to bomb the plague tanks at New Agamand to smithereens!
3107,"Ebon Blade Prisoners : Now that I'm back, I'm certain that the baron will want me to recover my men. I can see that we're barely hanging on here. The Lich King's forces are about to break through and we won't be able to hold without my captured death knights.Can you assist me once more, <name>?Go back to Jotunheim and let them out of those cages. Break the damn locks, I don't care what you have to do. The vrykul likely have the keys.Just get my men free!"
3108,"Scourge Tactics : We had the element of surprise on our side! We blew a hole in the side of the mountain and charged into Scourgeholme. Scourge opposition was fierce and it wasn't long until we were overwhelmed. We fell back to the valley and began raining artillery down on the Scourge that followed. This held them back for awhile until... Those monsters began using crusaders as living shields. We had to stop shelling for fear of killing our own soldiers.Free our crusaders trapped on the field outside the base, <class>!"
3109,"The Call Of The Crusade : <class>! The Argent Crusade is looking for able bodied soldiers that are willing to set aside their differences and join forces to battle the forces of the Lich King. Will you take up our cause?Should you be interested, venture north to Light's Trust and speak with Crusader Valus.You will find Light's Trust amidst the ruins of the sacked troll city of Jintha'kalar - bordering Zul'Drak.Farewell."
3110,"A Soldier in Need : You there!  Please, I need your help.  This soldier will succumb to the cryptfiends' venom unless we act immediately.I've managed to slow down the poison, but without a suitable supply of antidote I cannot counteract it.I was promised a new shipment of anti-venom in the Stormbreaker's most recent trip from the south.  Go inside its hold and search for a chest of first aid supplies.Hurry, <class>!  We can't afford to lose any more men unnecessarily."
3111,"Anguish of Nifflevar : All that we know of the vrykul indicates that they only recently appeared in Northrend. Why, then, are we seeing vrykul in visions that date back 15,000 years? Surely if the vrykul had previously existed in Northrend we would have known.You must press on to Nifflevar. To get there you must go northeast, through Wyrmskull Village, and take the path leading up through the dam. Nifflevar is on the bluffs of the fjord.Use the incense burner once you arrive at Nifflevar and search the area for clues."
3112,"No Mercy for the Captured : We have more fools for you to kill.My agents tell me that several of our good citizens have seen fit to fall into the hands of the Scarlet Onslaught.This will not do.Go back to New Hearthglen and eliminate Deathguard Schneider, Senior Scrivener Kinnedius, Engineer Burke and Chancellor Amai.From what I hear, they're spread out throughout the area. No doubt they are being kept in cages awaiting torture.Speak with them and then kill them!"
3113,"Taken by the Scourge : <Mortuus sighs.>Peons... We may as well post up a sign offering the Nerub'ar a free meal.See, the problem with a peon is that: (1) they're dumber than dirt; and (2) they're weaker than a leper gnome. Of course they're the first to be taken by the Scourge!This puts me in a bit of a predicament, you see. Without peons, manual labor comes to a halt. No peons, no construction.Find and release my peons, <race>. If they're alive, you'll find 'em spun up in webbing throughout Mightstone Quarry."
3114,"The Bone Witch : You remember Lady Nightswood, don't you? She certainly remembers you. She's the forlorn and very angry banshee that you 'saved' when you also broke Vile and myself out from under the Lich King's dominion.The lady has gone into Jotunheim and possessed their bone witch. She intends to wreak havoc upon the vrykul from within.She has asked that you seek her out. You'll find her in the cave on the south side of Njorndar Village to the southwest within Jotunheim."
3115,"Too Much of a Good Thing : There. I've modified the mojo. Now when the prophet drinks it, not only will he lose some of his power, his mind will also be addled by the effects of the fungus.At least that's the theory.As for how to get him to drink it, might I suggest you simply throw it at him? No doubt he'll catch and drink it given the arrogance that he's displayed at the altar.Unless you can kill him, <class>, your Argent Crusade is about to come to a terrible end."
3116,"This Just In: Fire Still Hot! : Trolls attack Rageclaw Den and kick Rageclaw out! It get worse. Trolls now burning village! This very bad. Chief make top Rageclaw shaman, Moky, do study on fire. Results very surprising! Fire still hot and can burn things.Will you help Rageclaw and put fire out? Moky has special Rageclaw fire extinguisher for you. Use special fire extinguisher to put out fire at Rageclaw Den to southeast. Sometimes take many sprays to douse fire, but extinguisher always have water! Rageclaw magic strong!"
3117,Puzzling... : Something about this scrap of metal prevents you from casting it aside.Perhaps Raelorasz might be able to shed some light on its purpose.
3118,"WANTED: Ragemane's Flipper : Posted by Chief Rageclaw:Chief Rageclaw trusty lion seal, Ragemane, bite hand that feed him. Rageclaw say Ragemane no more good because of bad Drakuru trolls. Chief Rageclaw very sad to ask that Ragemane be killeded and Ragemane flipper be returned to chief as proof.You find Ragemane to southeast, at Rageclaw Lake.Chief Rageclaw sorry for bad writing. First time use one of these things; plus, Chief Rageclaw is wolvar, not person."
3119,"Blightbeasts be Damned! : You've no doubt seen the army of Anub'ar blightbeasts that are being constructed at Icemist Village. The Anub'ar have plans to send those monsters against our soldiers at the Wrathgate. This cannot happen!Venture west to Icemist Village with this flare gun and use it to call down one of my war riders. Climb on its back and command it to destroy the blightbeasts that are out of reach from the ground!Once you have decimated their aerial forces, return to me for your reward!"
3120,"Hoofing It : Okay, we done! Time to go back. No crocolisk to ride this time though.If we go east and stay near ridge, it should lead all the way back near hill.Need to be careful not to go far below ridge though or we might go right into big-tongue tree village thing. Zepik not think they like us right now."
3121,Returned Sevenfold : The agents of the Lich King have foolishly trespassed upon these lands where the power of life rules supreme.  All harm they inflict will be returned to them sevenfold.The monster directly responsible for corrupting the land is known as Thalgran Blightbringer; you will find him just to the north of here.  Take this ward and use it to reflect the power of death upon him.  Show the Scourge that the power of life prevails above all.
3122,"Threat From Above : The Argent Crusade has doubled the guard since your exposure of the Cult of the Damned's infiltrator. They know the cultists won't stop until they've destroyed this area and thwarted the tournament.The Argent Crusade's scouts have reported sighting a frost wyrm named Chillmaw leading a cult raiding party.You must intercept and destroy them before they attack. The scouts reporting seeing Chillmaw to the southwest, flying over the area between the Ironwall Rampart and Aldur'thar."
3123,"Veranus : If I'm to launch an attack against my brother's army, I'm going to need some way to get around.I released my riding drake back into the wild years ago.  Veranus was magnificent.  The leader of her own brood -- to whom she has now returned.Finding her will be hard, but perhaps there's a way.  She keeps her old empty nest out of pure pride.  She's a broodmother in name only, for she is beyond the age of breeding.Bring me small eggs from the other nests near Brunnhildar.  I think I've an idea."
3124,"The High Executor Needs You : It's a good thing that I intercepted this request from High Executor Wroth before it got to Overlord Agmar. What is Wroth thinking?<The sergeant rips up the letter that he's holding.><class>, go see what it is that the high executor wants.Follow the road east and pass through The Dragon Wastes. You'll find a path leading up out of the wastes on the southeast side, and the Forsaken town, Venomspite, will stand before you on the south side of the mountain."
3125,"The Amphitheater of Anguish: Magnataur! : This next match is a doozy, buddy! Apparently some magnataur from the Dragonblight wants a piece of the action. You ever fought one of those before? All I can tell you is to aim high!We'll get this party started when you give me the word."
3126,"Parts for the Job : So Harris wants a demolition job, eh?  Yeah, I can help out.You're gonna have to get me some parts, though.  I can't afford to use up my choice components on something that's gonna get blown up.First of all, I'm going to need shoveltusk ligaments... way better than the human kind.I will also need a pound of flesh.  A fellow known as Anton sells cheap meat.  He travels up and down the road to the west."
3127,"Sindragosa's Fall : You're a real star, <name>.  See, when I give one of these other soldiers an assignment, the odds of them getting it done are about fifty-fifty.  The odds of them coming back... well, slightly worse.But with you, it's always a guaranteed thing.  Like gnomish clockwork!Anyway, I have another one for you.  Sindragosa's Fall, east of the valley.  There is some serious cultist activity, including and not limited to, the raising of frost wyrms.  I need you to go kick their teeth in.I hate cultists."
3128,Armor of Darkness : This armor plate is thick and oversized compared to the rest of the golem's defenses. A quick examination of the golem's corpse reveals that this heavier plate seems to have been bolted on as an afterthought or a crude upgrade.Why would the iron dwarves have added this redundant and mismatched armor to their war golems?Perhaps Bruor Ironbane would know if he had the chance to examine several of these plates from stormforged war golems.
3129,"Blending In : Sage Aeire has finished the shroud. Take it with you and travel to the Temple City of En'kilah. Don the cloak within the city's bounds to hide yourself from most of the Scourge there. This will be our best opportunity to gather information about the enemy's fortifications and leaders.While wearing the cloak, scout the three large spires on the grounds of the city. While the shroud will shield you from most of the Scourge, the En'kilah abominations will be able to find you if you get too close."
3130,"Reading the Bones : One of the benefits of possessing this creature is that I have access to all of her powers. As a bone witch and rune reader, she has the power to throw the bones and determine one's fate.<The Bone Witch smirks.>Lucky for you and I that I have it within my power to influence those readings.Bring me the bones of the vrykul that you kill here in Jotunheim and I will toss them to allow you to determine your own fate."
3131,"Foolish Endeavors : This is madness. How do they expect us to take on a Scourge necrolord and an unknown number of his minions?<Getry sighs.>If Ickoris sent you he must think that you are capable of great feats. Perhaps you will call down a miracle today, eh?When you're ready we will descend and face Varidus.If we make it out of this mess in one piece, report back to Hellscream in Warsong Hold."
3132,"The Might of the Horde : The taunka are now our brothers in arms. We must show our solidarity and retake Icemist Village.You will find Icemist Village west of Agmar's Hammer, sitting at the foot of the mountains. Travel there and challenge the Anub'ar Nerubians! Plant our beloved Horde banner at Icemist Village and destroy all that dare come to tear it down!Let the Anub'ar feel the true might of the Horde! Let our battle standard be the last thing that they see before death!"
3133,"Ruuna's Request : I will not charge you gold for my services, for I can foresee that your actions are necessary and much hinges on what you learn today.I will, however, ask you to collect a reagent for me.  Obtain gossamer dust from the fern feeder moths northeast of here.  Do this and I will prepare a potion that will take you to the time and place where the events took place that you need to witness."
3134,"Find Bristlehorn : Bristlehorn should have returned by now.The other reason why we came up here was to investigate that Scourge structure to the west, which fell from the sky. He's impetuous and has likely gotten himself into trouble.<name>, go to that place and find him, please."
3135,"Taking on All Challengers : Let's get you started.  The good news is that by defeating Agnetta, you've earned yourself a spot in the next round of matches.The bad news is that all your opponents will also have defeated someone in the first round.  Do not expect pushovers."
3136,"Doing Your Duty : Alright, <race>. Here's the juice.It works immediately, so don't use it until you're safely inside the outhouse.Now go get me those seeds!"
3137,"Fruits of Our Labor : The Scourge just keeps coming... but we can't give up!  Listen, <name>.  Inside that mine there's a cart with the last of the ore the Alliance is going to see on this side of the continent for a long time.The problem is the cart release is locked.  When the military went in there, Captain Jacobs commandeered all the important equipment, including the cart release key.The plague that affected the soldiers in the mine must also have affected Jacobs.  Get the key from him and salvage the ore."
3138,"Free at Last : The rock shard you imbued should be powerful enough to break the runic magic binding my brothers.Take it with you and find the runed giants walking north along the Eastwind Shore. Unleash the power stored in the stone and observe the results.If it works, the runed giants should return to their senses and stop obeying the iron dwarves. If the stone fails to work, the giants may attack in a weakened state. But, what choice do we have? If we do not try, they will remain enslaved without hope."
3139,"A Return to Resting : <Orfus hands you a satchel.>Within this satchel are the artifacts that you recovered. Locate the burial mounds of Shield Hill, far to the southeast, where the items were originally stolen from and return the artifacts. It is my hope that this gesture will quell the spirits that now haunt our hunting grounds.Be strong, <name>..."
3140,"Destroying the Altars : So they're summoning in their workers and warriors at those altars?They'll need to be the first thing to go. The master summoner should have a staff which allows him to activate the portal. If you kill the master summoner and take the staff, you can use it to overload the summoning portal and destroy its altar.Do this at all four of the altars and return to me once they've been destroyed."
3141,"Troll Patrol : Unsheathe that weapon, <race>. It's time to go on patrol!I've got four posts under my command and it's crucial to our success that they remain in our control. I'm ordering you to visit each of them and offer your assistance.You can begin with Captain Brandon southeast of here. He'll direct you to the next post when he's finished with you.Report back to me once you've assisted each of my men. And remember, you'll be more richly rewarded for returning to me quickly - so double-time it!Dismissed!"
3142,"Clean Up : To the point... Ricket's asked me to put together some stronger land mines, but I'm running low on parts.Just west of town, you'll find the remains of our last rocket sled... Ricket got a little excited when she was fueling it, but I probably should have thought to not put the nozzle right over the exhaust. Live and learn, eh?There should be a good stock of spare parts scattered around the destroyed sled... why don't you go ahead and chase off those scavengers and nab me some of that wreckage?"
3143,"Meat on the Hook : The time has come my friend: Tu'u'gwar must be dealt with!I've prepped the meat so that the beast is sure to come once you bait the hook I have out in the water. Just follow the fishing line here down to it.Whatever you do, don't let Tu'u'gwar swallow you whole, <name>!"
3144,"Pieces of the Puzzle : We've seen the iron dwarves and their constructs making war on the creatures of stone that Brann calls the earthen, along with their giant allies. Contact him and aid him in any way you can, and remember that anything we can learn from his search may aid us in fighting against the iron dwarves and their master."
3145,"The Mechagnomes : Now that you're here, it's time for me to tell you the full story of what's going on.After you've heard my tale, go outside and find my second-in-command, Jinky Wingnut. She'll handle everything from here on out."
3146,"He's Gone to Pieces : With the abduction of Crusader Olakin, the Argent Crusade's forces will have no commander in the final assault on the Fleshwerks. While one crusader is the same as any other to me, the argents won't see it that way.I hate to see us waste time chasing after this, but I have no choice. Our gallant crusader has likely been dismembered by now, and his remains used to construct abominations. Go down into the Fleshwerks, kill the corpulent horrors fighting our forces, and recover Olakin's body parts."
3147,"Apply Heat and Stir : You've done well so far, <name>.  I'd like to teach you some of my more advanced techniques, so that you gain a better understanding of the plague.Take this empty flask and fill it with blood from the cauldron to my left.  Mix it with the plague samples to my right until you obtain a well balanced mix."
3148,"Exploiting an Opening : I've got an interesting assignment for you, <name>.  If you're up for a challenge, that is.We've been tipped off about an opening below Icecrown Citadel.  Our engineers have studied the layout and have decided it's a structural weakness.We've sent some men there along with some ""borrowed"" saronite bombs.  They're under Captain Kendall's command.With a little help we could deal a huge blow to the forces of the Scourge.  What do you say, <name>?"
3149,"Dreadsaber Mastery: Stalking the Prey : I have heard that the natives tell stories of a large dreadsaber they call Shango. I haven't seen any evidence of this Shango's existence, but my injuries have kept me from venturing outside the camp.If you fancy yourself something of a tracker, you might be able to find out the truth about Shango. Debaar said she saw some large tracks on her last outing. Go north from the camp toward Bittertide Lake, and search its southern shore for the prints."
3150,"Monitoring the Rift: Cleftcliff Anomaly : Greetings, <race>. I am Garren of Dalaran.Not long ago, the rift was a peaceful place - geothermally speaking at least.Recently though, earthquakes have occurred with alarming frequency and scars in the earth have appeared, exposing unique energy fields of chaotic power.My mission here is to chart and monitor these anomalies. My instruments indicate that another has appeared on the cliff face to the southwest.Take this device with you and use it when you locate the new disruption."
3151,"The Slumbering King : A sheaf of parchment drops from the still hand of the overlord. Upon it you can discern the outline of the rituals that are taking place in the catacombs below.However, it appears that the queen of the vrykul, Angerboda, is having difficulty awakening King Ymiron. The ritual is taking place within the large chamber, known as the Winter's Terrace, on the north end of Gjalerbron.If you hurry, you may be able to stop her before it is too late."
3152,"A Race Against Time : So it's true. They have her.It's clear what must be done, <race>. She WILL be saved.I must remain here and aid in the rescue preparations. I call upon you again; this time to collect the prison key. All we know of this Salrand figure is that she cannot be harmed so long as her shield is intact.We've customized a special explosive that should strip her of this protection, allowing you to perform your duty. Return to me when you've collected the key.Hurry, <name>. Lady Evanor is suffering!"
3153,"Thassarian, the Death Knight : Well, <name>, you helped us out... so I figure it's only fair that we help you out as well.You're looking for Thassarian?  He disappeared this morning.  We think he went off north to the Wailing Ziggurat.  If we hadn't fought side by side by him we'd even think he was a traitor.See, he's a Death Knight... and I know they're on our side and all... but it wasn't too long ago they were servants of Arthas.But not Thassarian, he's a good guy.  Go to the Wailing Ziggurat, see if he's doing okay."
3154,"The Defense of Warsong Hold : Do not let Hellscream dissuade you from your duties as a soldier of the Horde, <race>. He bears a terrible burden in these frozen wastes, with the outcome of his charge resulting in victory over the Scourge or the extinction of all life on Azeroth. It is for this reason that we require your strength and wisdom.The Scourge have begun their assault upon this fortress. Our soldiers steady the line, but are in desperate need of backup. Report to Razgor. He is stationed directly outside of Warsong Hold."
3155,"Unfit for Death : Just south of us the caribou used to roam freely, peacefully. Then Nesingwary showed up and everything changed. Now the caribou are in a perpetual state of frenzy, always in a panic. They are stalked by the hunters and trappers hidden in the field.Nesingwary's executioners are unfit for death. They must feel the torture that they put the caribou through!Take this pile of fake furs and lay it upon their caribou traps to the south. Watch as the hunters are caught in their own deadly traps!"
3156,"The Fallen Pillar : The titans shaped entire life forms here, fostering their unfettered growth.The five crystal pillars that surround the basin emanate pure lifeforce.  The Scourge should've never been able to penetrate the basin, but one of the pillars was destroyed.Go to the Lifeblood Pillar and see if you can find out what happened.  No undead would've been able to approach the pillar, so keep your eyes out for living intruders.  You'll find what remains of the pillar directly south of here."
3157,"Cracking the Code : I sense a distinct peculiarity in the drakes here but the meaning of the runes that cover their bodies still eludes me.Without a codex, it will take more time than we can afford for me to interpret them.Not far from here is a Kirin Tor traitor, Caleras, who is likely to have a copy of the tome I require. His underlings hold the runes I will need for my translation.Hurry, mortal. Malygos gains strength with every passing moment."
3158,"The Lonesome Watcher : I never found the core... but I've often spoken to the keeper Creteus, and his omissions give him away. You'll find Creteus over the mountains to the east, in the Foot Steppes, keeping watch on the Engine of the Makers. The core might well be in there, but you'll need to win Creteus's favor.The iron dwarves were here looking for something... it might well be the core. They took my ring. Find their leader, get the ring back, and show it to Creteus so that he knows I sent you."
3159,"Where Dragons Fell : A whole brood of blue dragons fell here.  And now, one by one, they're being raised by his servants.He raised the biggest of them all himself.  Bring me some bone dust from the whelps and I'll show you exactly how he did it."
3160,"Need to Know : I need to know what New Hearthglen is up to.I want you to steal their orders of the day so that I can find that out.Head south and in their abbey, in their barracks, and on their beach, find those daily plans!Just in case you're confused, the barracks is the large building right next to the smithy."
3161,"Gray Worg Hides : Let me tell you something, mon.  When you get put in charge of outfittin' the armies of the Horde, you go through a lot of hides!Conqueror Krenna, the she-wolf runnin' this place, she gave me a tight deadline.  If I don't outfit her whole regiment by week's end she's gonna have me wrestling bears in the pit.Help me out and I'll pay you top price.  I'll be needin' hides from graymist hunters.You'll find them all around in pockets to the north, hunting stag.  Remember, mon.  Top price!"
3162,"The Will of the Naaru : I appreciate everything that you have done for us, <name>. I have one last errand for you... one last gleaming hope for a paladin who deserves any salvation that we can extend.Go now to Shattrath and speak to the naaru, A'dal. He has long been a beacon of light and powerful ally to devout paladins. Impart Bridenbrad's story and seek any aid that he might have to offer.I cannot impress how important it is that you move quickly - I fear our crusader does not have much more time in this world."
3163,"The Frost Wyrm and its Master : Your instincts were right to bring this to me, but my wind riders cannot fight a dragon. You must venture west to Gjalerbron and slay the frost wyrm and its master, Wyrmcaller Vile!Even now it may be on its way!If I'm reading these plans correctly, blowing the wyrmcaller's horn on his platform, outside in the rear left area of Gjalerbron, will call Glacion back. When the creature lands, destroy it!And <name>, bring me the horn. We wouldn't want it falling back into the wrong hands!"
3164,"Spiritual Insight : <race>, we have not heard from our people at Indu'le Village since the ground shook and was torn apart!Have you ever been upon a vision quest? You've bested Loguhn, so you must be capable.I will give you a special incense to sprinkle into my brazier. Breathe deep from its vapors and your spirit will be sent aloft to view what has transpired at Indu'le.As your spirit soars, I will be able to look through your eyes."
3165,"Call to Arms! : Farshire has a fighting chance now, <name>.  That's all we could've asked for and you've made it possible.All we need now is a rallying point.  I'll have my men deliver the weapons to our town hall.  Go and ring the town hall bell so any survivors know to rally there.It's time to show the Scourge what we're made of."
3166,"Dreadsaber Mastery: Ready to Pounce : Shango awaits, <name>. If you have succeeded in your tracking, he will not know that you stalk him, and you will need the advantage.He is supposed to be bigger, stronger, and more ferocious than the other dreadsabers of the basin. Travel north, to the western shore of Bittertide Lake and near the falls that feed it, do battle with Shango. If you succeed, return with his pelt."
3167,"We Strike! : One of your orcs named Steeljaw tried to save some time by taking a shortcut through our burial grounds. This had better not be how your Horde normally acts, <race>, or you will find the taunka to be the end of you!But, you look as if you want to help fix this situation. Good!Steeljaw's cursed spirit now haunts this place and disturbs the remains of my ancestors. We must put an end to him!If we live through this, tell your Overlord Bor'gorok at the outpost to the north.Are you with me?"
3168,"Precious Elemental Fluids : <The hexxer examines the decanter of mojo.>I have an idea for how to deal with the prophet of Sseratus. But first, we're going to need some things.The Drak'Sotra Fields are directly to the south. Because of the stresses on the land from the Scourge and the deaths of gods, the wall between worlds has weakened and the elementals are flooding in.We need the precious fluids of their lords. If you combine three links from the elementals a tether will be made, and one of their lords can be summoned."
3169,"Among the Champions : As a champion, you have mastered the art of mounted combat, besting challengers of all levels. When the tournament begins, those you have defeated will have redoubled their efforts and will seek to avenge their losses to you.It would be wise to continue practicing your skills against the combatants waiting in the Ring of Champions. Equip your lance, go to the stables on the southern side of the grounds. then mount up on any mount you're permitted to use, and face the champions."
3170,"The Conquest Pit: Final Showdown : You must've really upset Krenna.  She and Gorgonna have had a spat and you're wanted in the pit immediately.There are some wild rumors that it's a fight to the death!  That would be bad news for you, but great news for our business venture!At any rate, you can't run away from fate... best get in there on the quick and get it over with."
3171,"Hell Hath a Fury : It is now time for you to punish my three high priests: Mu'funu, Tua-Tua, and Hawinni. You'll find them spread around the altar grounds.Take this hexxing stick. I've empowered it with my rage and indignation. I'm sure that it will prove potent.Just use it and proceed to destroy them. The hex will take care of the rest.<Quetz'lun displays a toothy grin.>Succeed and I may let you go. Fail and die."
3172,"The Core's Keeper : Prospector Soren's notes say that Norgannon's Core is in the keeping of a sentinel named Athan, one of Mimir's creations.Soren says the vault where Athan resides is called ""Loken's Bargain"" these days.Loken, eh? The earthen have mentioned him.The vault is said to be southwest of the ruined Explorers' League camp, with a round entrance on a mountainside overlooking the Valley of Ancient Winters.Find this Athan and get the core from him, but I wouldn't be surprised if you were in for a fight."
3173,"Breakfast Of Champions : Now that the coliseum is complete, the Argent Crusade has asked us to help look after the creatures that champions will be fighting.The giant jormungar have perhaps the strangest diet; they grow strong by eating the eggs of their own kind and the best eggs come from deep jormungar.Take this drum to the Foot Steppes in central Storm Peaks and play them near the snow mounds you see there. The sound will rouse the deep jormungar. Kill them, collect their egg sacs, and return to the tournament grounds."
3174,Demolitionist Extraordinaire : You've got some swift feet on you sonny! Thanks for lending a hand with those explosives... I've been waiting to give that invention a good test run for a while!Go ahead and tell Ricket we should be covered on the magnataur front now... my sappers will clean up any of the remaining baddies.Thanks again!
3175,"Victory Nears... : There remain only two primary threats that stand in our way. One is the dread citadel of Naxxramas, far to the east, above the Alliance fortress of Wintergarde and the other is the Pit of Narjun, exit point for the undead armies of Azjol'Nerub. It is from the Pit of Narjun that the Anub'ar Nerubians assaulted and ultimately razed the taunka village of Icemist.We will destroy the Anub'ar and close off the Pit of Narjun.Report to Senior Sergeant Juktok for your mission orders."
3176,"The Fallen Sisters : To the southwest was a glade that used to look much like this one. Mysterious forces and alien magics are reshaping the land. The glade has thawed, the sisters living there driven mad by the sudden change.We thought to reach out to them, but they attacked us. I fear many may be beyond saving, but I cannot give up hope.Take my pendant, travel southwest to the Vibrant Glade, and use it to try to free my sisters."
3177,"March of the Giants : To the east, at Giants' Run, rune-inscribed stone giants have started to migrate north toward Frostblade Peak. I know nothing of their goals, nor of their destination.The glowing runes inscribed in the stone flesh of the giants guide them on their journey. Fell some of these giants.Take this pick with you and use it on the corpses of the runed stone giants. It will deactivate the runes. Once you've tested enough giants, return to me with your findings."
3178,"Mounting Up : Cap'n Stoutmantle left most of our calvary... cavlary... uh, horsemen at the fight for Venture Bay.We chose a good place to put the camp 'cause there are tons of highland mustangs running around near here and in the Boulder Hills to the northeast. The Cap'n put me in charge of capturing some of 'em.Will you help? I've got a stick and some string, and there are loads of wild carrots growing near the camp. Pick the carrots and use them with the stick to lure in the mustang, then ride it back here."
3179,"Gormok Wants His Snobolds : Two of my men have already been killed trying to confine the magnataur called Gormok the Impaler, yet the creature still rages. It howls for hours about being without its favorite snobold.If the Argent Crusade didn't wish to use this monster in the coliseum, I'd slay it myself. Perhaps it's time to bring the beast its playthings. Take this net and travel to Garm's Bane in southeast Storm Peaks. It's just northeast of K3. Capture some of those snobolds and pray to the Light you've found the right one."
3180,"Mastery of the Crystals : Sparktouched are still being attacked by puppy-men... we think they maybe not stop if we not make them stop. We have secret weapon though... we sent it out to Soo-met so he can use to protect all Oracles.Secret weapon is from Great Ones themselves... extra shiny crystals found inside sacred Great One temples. Be very careful... no break them.Crystals are in chest near shrine at Sparktouched Haven, in far southwest. You go use crystals to help Soo-met beat the puppy-men."
3181,"Galakrond and the Scourge : Atop the Wicked Coil, the Grand Necrolord of the Scourge, Antiok, sits upon the shoulders of the reconstructed storm giant lord, Thiassi. From there he commands the armies of undead to work day and night to unearth Galakrond's massive bones. Should they succeed in raising Galakrond, all of your efforts will have been for naught.While I cannot call down the full fury of the Red Dragonflight to assist you in your journey, I will grant you my blessing. Go now and speak with my majordomo, Torastrasza."
3182,"Hah... You're Not So Big Now! : That'll do her, chief! So, here's what I want ya to do....Take my blaster and head north to Magmoth. If we're gonna have a chance at all against those monsters, we need to cut them down to size... so to speak.In order to gauge its effectiveness, I need you to slay the magnataur while the blaster's effects are still on it. Any of the crushers or mates will do, but don't bother with the offspring... they're too small to worry about."
3183,"One of a Kind : Such a strange seal to see among magnataur... it suggests an unusual amount of organization.Magnataur rarely put aside their aggressive natures to cooperate with each other.  I suspect they have their eyes set on raiding a large settlement.I very much doubt that this horn is unique, I need you to prove me wrong. In the canyon northwest of the Azure Dragonshrine you will find Bonesunder. Go challenge him and bring me back any evidence you find that might confirm my concerns."
3184,"The Mosswalker Savior : There's some small chance that the Mosswalkers are not all dead yet... and at the very least, they deserve to not be butchered like this.Let's find some revenge for this slaughter and see if there are any to be saved in the process."
3185,"Blinding the Eyes in the Sky : The Alliance has somehow managed to field a squadron of recon vehicles over the Valley of Fallen Heroes and Icecrown Glacier, the broad areas west of Aldur'thar.They cannot be permitted to take the lead in this fight. Chief Engineer Copperclaw has supplied me with the perfect weapon to deal with this threat -- he calls his new missile the SGM-3. I have his assurances that it will take out the Alliance flying machines in a single hit. Go and use this weapon to give us the upper hand."
3186,"Agmar's Hammer : Directly east of this refugee camp stands Agmar's Hammer - testament to the Hordes' power in the Dragonblight.While I have no doubt that our Horde brothers and sisters are already seeing the result of your efforts to bring the taunka into the Horde, I want you to deliver news of your success to Overlord Agmar in person.Go now, <name>! Race the winds! East to Agmar's Hammer!"
3187,"How To Slay Your Dragon : Hodir's Spear is an icon of great prowess in battle.Its mere presence instills a deep hunger for glory in all who enter Dun Niffelem. In fact, simply being near it has compelled you to test your own abilities.Scanning the horizon, your vision locks on a wild wyrm as it flies nearby.It is decided. Of you and he, only one shall see the next sunrise...."
3188,"The Truth Shall Set Us Free : Zelig gave this crystal ball to me years ago with specific instruction on its use. For five years - whenever I would feel anger, anxiety, or sorrow over the events that transpired here - I was to focus my thoughts upon the orb.I now understand why Zelig gave this crystal to me.Take my crystalline orb to the Forgotten Shore. Find the ruins of my old base on the upper reaches of the beach and place the orb in the center of town. Let the forgotten see the world through my heart and soul."
3189,"Anatoly Will Talk : My sister is here somewhere, and I can't seem to get this monster to talk.He doesn't seem to care about his own well-being, but I've an idea.  I knew Anatoly's wife, Tatjana, from before the wolfcult arrived -- she was a horse-handler.Take this tranquillizer dart.  Bring her back alive, we're going to need her if we're to have any leverage with Anatoly.I will help you find the person behind all this once we save my sister."
3190,"Opportunity : We recently came upon schematics that indicate a weakness in Icecrown Citadel.  An opening in its defenses, both figuratively and literally.The captured diagrams show an orifice leading several hundred feet into the ground.  We're unsure of its purpose, but our scouting has revealed it to be of high importance to the Scourge.Speak to Sergeant Kregga below Icecrown Citadel, she's leading the attack on the site."
3191,Zul'Drak : Our death knight allies in Zul'Drak are in need of heroes to aid them in securing the troll lands from the Scourge.Those willing to aid should travel to the southwestern camp of Ebon Watch and speak with Stefan Vadu there.
3192,"Pieces to the Puzzle : Thank the Light that someone got my message. Now that I'm safe from the iron dwarves, I need to ask your help with something. I've got a lead on Norgannon's keystone, which guards access to Ulduar's archives, but the Titans divided it into two pieces and secreted them away.One of the pieces, the keystone's shell, is held within the Inventor's Library on the northern coast, south of Ulduar itself. The first thing you'll need to do is retrieve the fragments of an access disk from the library's guardians."
3193,
3194,"From Whence They Came : My main concern is the saronite quarry down the path to the southwest. They are pulling up immense amounts of ore from that quarry and I'd like to know what they're building with it. To that end, we'll start by weakening their defenses.I noticed a series of crystals scattered throughout the base and I assume they are defensive structures of some sort, not unlike ziggurats. Use the eidolon watcher to destroy any of those crystals that you find."
3195,"Return of the Friendly Dryskin : Yay! Soo-say probably worrying about us! Maybe you go back to town and tell him everything okay? Yeah, go tell Soo-say.I going grab shiny ball thing from dead lich guy - I meet you there! Go go! I meet you there!"
3196,"Forging the Keystone : Aha! Here it is: the Temple of Invention, the seat of Keeper Mimir himself! Of course, that's where one would go to join the two parts of the key.According to the prospector's notes, the Temple of Invention is one of the highest points on the western side of the Terrace of the Makers. That means it should be roughly east of your Grom'arsh Crash Site.I'll meet you at the temple and we'll combine the parts together."
3197,"Eliminate the Competition : Mrrfrmrfrrmrrr...<The Leaper clears his throat.>Sorry about that. It can sometimes be hard to understand what I'm saying. You know how it is.I wanted to make sure that if you find yourself at the Savage Ledge, over the mountains to the west, that you make sure to eliminate the competition there.Specifically, I'd like you to challenge to duels and humiliate Sigrid Iceborn, Efrem the Faithful, Onu'zun, and Tinky Wickwhistle in front of the vrykul."
3198,"Two Wrongs... : Now that we've riled up these Ember Clutch proto-drakes, they may be inclined to continue their attacks upon the keep. This will not do.I hate to compound one wrong with another, but in this case it would appear that we will have to destroy the creatures. A regrettable course of action, but one that we need to undertake regardless.Take my wand. I've been experimenting with increasing its range, but it doesn't pack much of a punch. However, what it will do is get a proto-drake's attention."
3199,"Hell Has Frozen Over... : Fordragon's got another thing coming if he thinks the group of green-gilled scrubs he sent to defend this port can hold out much longer.<Macalroy raises an eyebrow as he examines your equipment.>You, however, might fare a bit better.The importance of holding this port cannot be stated enough; and with those monsters flying overhead, the situation around here has gone from bad to worse.Report to Vice Admiral Keller just northwest of here and let him know that you're all out of bubble gum."
3200,"Hodir's Call : You have done a great service to the giants of Dun Niffelem. Without your aid, this monument would not exist.As you silently ponder its significance, feelings begin to flood your heart. The feelings fill your mind with thoughts and images... as well as a sense of urgency.The sensations fade and leave you with a knowledge of what you must do. The restless spirits at Thunderfall must be put to rest.As you set off, you find that your hands have been filled with an ethereal horn."
3201,"Song of Wind and Water : Listen to storm, yes?  The Stormwright's Shelf echoes with ancient song.... the Song of Wind and Water.The great tempest devours the sons of typhoons and storms.  Take this drum and play his song... play Haiphoon's song.Help him feed on wind and water so tempest can continue."
3202,"King of the Mountain : Yo, <name>, I need you to get my jumpbot to the top of this mountain to the southeast, like yesterday!That girly, self-righteous Frazzle Geargrinder thinks that her jumpbot's better than mine. Hah! We're in a race to see who's gonna be king of the mountain!Once you jump up there, plant our battle standard in the pile of bones and show everyone that the Horde, and my mad engineering skills, are the best!"
3203,"Argent Aid : There were rumors about the events you speak of among the death knights.  I always expected the story to be more... symbolic.We must warn others, but we must be discreet.  As soon as the Lich King knows we're making our move, he'll move the location of the heart -- we'll never get a chance like this again.The Horde and the Alliance have been infiltrated by the Cult of the Damned before.  The Ebon Blade operates too close to the Scourge.We have to speak to Tirion Fordring and his Argent Crusade."
3204,"The Sapphire Queen : Bristlepine can be dangerous, but most stay far away from wolvar. Wasps on other hand not fear the Frenzyheart... they even kill some of our hunters.I know Rakjak want wasp queen dead, but no wolvar want to go into her hive. You go kill wasp queen in Sapphire Hive to southeast and get stinger for Rakjak. Me bet Rakjak like that."
3205,"A Father's Words : There is someone who might shed light on this mystery, <race>.  It is rumored that the Kvaldir have kept a naga priestess alive at the temple on the west side of the shore.She will no doubt have great reason to resent her uninvited Kvaldir guests.  Perhaps my father is expecting her to cooperate with you in some way."
3206,"Brother Betrayers : Mistwalker is from my dreams! If you are his friend, you are mine.I was alpha male until the last full moon. Then the strange white worg, Garwal, came from the north, and with the help of my once-brothers, he quickly became alpha. There is something unnatural about him.To help, you must first kill those who betrayed me.Bjomolf hunts to the northwest of a place the two-legs call Steel Gate. And look for Varg to the southeast, near the West Spear Tower.They will not be fooled by your form."
3207,"Against the Giants : While it's going to be crucial to defeat the Scourge on the ground, we mustn't neglect the gate itself.The flesh giants on the ramparts are capable of hurling massive boulders and chunks of ice, inflicting devastating damage to enemy infantry below.Muster a force and defeat these giants. We need to know just what we're up against in terms of their strength.Oh... and bring me their spines. If memory serves, there's a little trick I can share with you."
3208,"Fervor of the Frostborn : I be more than willing ta lend my shelter and home ta travelers in need, but I'm nae too keen ta force my people inte yer affairs.I'll tell ye what... my people are warriors, straight and true. On the day a frostborn becomes a man, he has ta prove himself in battle. He has ta show us that he'll not let size hold'm back.Show me yer as strong and fierce as one of my men, and I'll have them lend ye an ear or a blade. Speak ta Fjorlin over by the cliff to the south there and he'll put ye ta the test."
3209,"""Crowleg"" Dan : Croaker's spoken, matey. ""Crowleg"" Dan's on da ship yonder.Best go trace that blaggard, mon.  Show'im dis set's not fe be crossed.  Gaan back fe Terry when ye keelhaul 'is behind."
3210,"Amidst the Confusion : Shutting down their operation is just half of the plan. The other important goal here is to find out where all that saronite is being sent. We know of a few places it's been ending up, but the amount they're pulling out suggests to me that there's a bigger project in the works.Once you're inside the quarry, get your hands on any of their documents that you can find. If you're assaulting the place with one of the gryphons, you can drop down from it as soon as the wetwork is done."
3211,"Elder Atuik and Kamagua : <Orfus bundles up the clues you brought him.>My people are bitterly entrenched in a war with the Northsea Freebooters. If any tuskarr could help us in our quest to right the wrongs of the pirates, it will be Elder Atuik of Kamagua. You must take these clues to him at once.To get to Kamagua you must take the Ancient Lift, behind me. Take the lift directly to Kamagua and find Elder Atuik."
3212,"Feeding Arngrim : Arngrim's hunger was legendary.Even in death, his expression is one of famished yearning. You find that just looking at him is making your stomach growl.It is said that throughout his life he was never truly sated, and that there was absolutely nothing he wouldn't eat. You wonder to yourself if there might be a way to feed the old king.No sooner does the thought enter your mind than one of the massive frozen teeth falls from Arngrim's head, bounces off of his beard and lands in your hand."
3213,"The Honored Ancestors : <A distant voice echoes in your head as you regard the stone statue.>Do not be startled, stranger. I am Elder Atkanok, an ancient ancestor of the tuskarr people, a skilled craftsman in my own time and the guardian of this quarry for centuries.The quarry has been overrun, leaving many statues unfinished while the ancestors' spirits wander the world. Will you aid me in righting this wrong?First, I must know the names of these wandering ancestors. Look for the markers near their statues."
3214,"The End of the Line : Within his robes you find two things of interest.One is a talisman, which is clearly a focus controlling device. The other is a set of orders from someone named Sidragos, which were ultimately intended for the leader back at the Moonrest Gardens.The fragile water-soaked parchment informs Goramosh that he is to move all mage hunter forces east to the Azure Dragonshrine.Perhaps you should get what information you can from the focus and head east to observe the dragonshrine from its western ledge."
3215,"""Scoodles"" : One of the first things Jonah Sterling did after he went crazy was to take my prized sin'dorei scrying crystal and feed it to the bane of my existence, ""Scoodles"" the orca.No I didn't name the damned thing. I just know that she swims out past the ships directly southeast of Scalawag. Kill that overinflated goldfish and rip out my beautiful sin'dorei crystal from its stomach.Do this and we can get down to business."
3216,"The Broken Front : What battle?! Those troops were on a recon mission!And what's this talk of Alliance - you're sure he said Alliance?Listen to me, <name>! I need to know what's going on and I need to know NOW!Get yourself down there and get me some answers! Scour the battlefield and look for survivors - clues - anything!"
3217,"Gamel the Cruel : My own father was slain by the leader of this raiding party, Gamel the Cruel.  He has made his abode inside a cave on the beach.You've dealt with his men already.  Finish what you've started, <name>.  Avenge my father and I will share with you what little I still have."
3218,"The Key to the Focusing Iris : A potent thrumming of magical nature can be heard and felt emanating from the eye-shaped jewel dropped from Sapphiron's clutches. To mortal ears it is nearly painful to be in the presence of the stone.Surely such a powerful item of import can only be taken to the queen of the dragons, Alexstrasza the Life-Binder. Seek her counsel atop Wyrmrest Temple in the Dragonblight."
3219,"I'm Smelting... Smelting! : <Olakin turns one of the shards over in an armored fist.>These could pierce armor with enough force. We have to find out what they're made of and what the Lich King intends to do with them.To the east, nestled next to Icecrown Citadel itself, lies Malykriss. From the few reports we have, it's full of smelting and smithing equipment. Bring these shards there, and smelt them in one of the open furnaces on the bottom level of Malykriss. Once the metal has been reformed, we can identify it."
3220,"Discipline : Let's start you off with something straightforward.  The male vrykul that work the mines for us do so against their will... purely out of fear of our blades.Once in a while, one of them will lose their motivation.  Find any uncooperative vrykul and put them in their place.Take this disciplining rod.  You'll want to inflict pain, not death.  Well, most of the time anyway."
3221,"Travel to Moa'ki Harbor : <race>, word just arrived from Moa'ki Harbor. Something very bad happened over there this morning!You've been very helpful to us here. Would you consider using the boat from Unu'pe to travel to the great Dragonblight?By the sound of things, Elder Ko'nani could certainly use your assistance."
3222,"Them! : Our brothers and sisters across the water are now our mortal enemies. They have kidnapped our tadpoles, driven us out of our village, and killed more of us than I can count.Prove yourself, <race>! Swim across the rift and slay them!Despite the favor that the new king has shown you, only then will we consider accepting you here. Fail to do so, and you might as well leave now and never return!"
3223,"The Terrace of the Makers : It is time, <name>.  I am prepared to face Loken now.Let us make our way to the Terrace of the Makers and face my brother's forces.  The fool will regret ever crossing me."
3224,"A Champion Rises : Congratulations, <name>. You have mastered many kinds of combat and overcome all the challenges you've faced. There can be no doubt that you are ready to compete with the best warriors who have gathered at the tournament, against the champions of the capital cities.Justicar Mariel Trueheart has asked to speak with you, <name>, and to formally enter you in the champions' grand melee."
3225,"Back Through the Waygate : You speak the truth, <race>.  I can sense the very essence of Sholazar Basin begin to fray by the blight of undeath even as we speak.I've bound my being into the rune, <race>.  Deliver it to she who sent you here -- for only her power can grant me passage to her lands."
3226,"The Vile Hold : We need to know what we're up against.Use the eye of dominion to assume control of a lithe stalker and scout out the area. There are a few spots in particular I saw when flying in that I want you to get a closer look at: the overlook in the northeast, the work area in the southeast, the large forge near the center, and the ritual area in the southwest.The stalker can leap far and won't be hurt by large falls - use that to your advantage to get up and down from those ramparts."
3227,"That's What Friends Are For... : We were attacked by Prince Navarius and at least a dozen Scourge. I told Dargath and the twins to stay inside the tank, but they wouldn't listen. Dargath looked me in the eyes and said, ""If somebody doesn't get out of this tank, they'll kill us all."" He then made Reed cut the engine and charged. Most heroic thing I've ever seen.I heard the Prince barking orders to the monsters. Sounded like he was taking them to Thrym's End, northwest of here. We have to rescue our friends. Will you go look for them?"
3228,"Seeds of the Blacksouled Keepers : The glade to the northwest, now the Twisted Glade, used to be home to a number of keepers of the glade. Together with the sisters, they saw to the glade's upkeep.When the glade changed, the sisters died, but somehow the keepers managed to survive. Now, they seed the land with poisonous spores that wither healthy greenery.I'll give you one of the cores from the ice elementals. Once you've destroyed a spore, use the ice crystal to freeze it and keep it from regenerating."
3229,Warchief's Command: Borean Tundra! : All able bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to the Warsong Recruitment Officer at Warsong Hold.The Warsong Offensive needs your help to overcome the continued threat from the undead Scourge.Take the zeppelin to Warsong Hold from Orgrimmar's western zeppelin tower and present yourself to the recruitment officer.Destiny calls!
3230,"The Book of Runes : Chieftain Ashtotem dispatched me on a scouting mission to Giants' Run, a broad, rocky plateau to the southeast, past the Frozen Glade.The area has been taken over by Iron Dwarves who seem to be altering the giants as they emerge from the earth.The iron rune stonecallers and binders carry large tomes with them, which must contain the runes they're carving on the giants.Capture the pieces of this book, assemble them, and bring it back to me. It's the only way we'll understand their plans."
3231,"The Bones of Nozronn : Bones of Nozronn, Oracle Soo-rahm sends <name> to you!We have prepared incense for you. Light it and place it near Nozronn's head and you will hear his voice.<Confused, you tell Soo-rahm that you haven't even told him your question.>True, we not know, but mighty Nozronn does. Do not doubt. Nozronn will answer your heart's question.Go. Nozronn not wait long."
3232,"All Hail Roanauk! : Like the tauren, Forsaken, trolls and blood elves, so too do the taunka need a leader born of their own blood. The one you saved from Icemist, Roanauk, will be this leader.<Overlord Agmar hands you a parchment.>I give to you something familiar - the blood oath of the Horde.Take the oath to Roanauk Icemist and initiate him into the Horde as leader of the taunka.Let us not keep him waiting.<Agmar nods.>"
3233,"Steady as a Rock? : Orlond's notes indicate that he brought a piece of equipment called a portable seismograph with him, but the device is nowhere to be seen.The survey log shows that Orlond completed all his readings in the Thor Modan tunnel, save one labeled the 'east end of the exposed tunnel.'The last entry in the log indicates Orlond tried to take refuge in the water and was attacked by subterranean threshers. They might've taken his equipment.You'll need to recover it before you can take the last reading."
3234,"Seek Out Karuk! : A fellow survivor of Pal'ea known as Karuk has made his way to the main base of the Kvaldir in the Borean Tundra - far to the south where the snow was once bountiful. Karuk hides along the bluffs overlooking Riplash Strand.Seek out Karuk and let him know what you did for my people here at the Coast of Echoes.The safest route to Karuk is through your fortress. From Warsong Hold, take the road south and follow it around until you reach Riplash Strand."
3235,"A Change of Scenery : Excellent.  There's an exit in the eastern end of the mine that leads to Brunnhildar Village.  Follow it and I'll meet you there.We must not be seen together so no one suspects you of aiding me.  I'll use my magic to disguise my appearance.  Do not worry, <race> -- we'll find your friend in no time."
3236,"Rhino Mastery: The Kill : Now that we know where to find Farunn, all that remains is the battle against the great beast. Are you ready to take on this rhino, <name>? For all the spirit's blustering, I'm certain it was telling the truth about the beast's strength.When you're ready to face him, head north past the Suntouched Pillar and look for Farunn on the northeast shore of the Bittertide Lake. It may even venture near the Glimmering Pillar. Bring back its horn to commemorate your kill."
3237,Curing The Incurable : The number of injured soldiers rises with each passing day. They are being stricken by some type of toxin that we have never before seen. Whatever it is that these Nerubians hold within their venom glands is lethal and incurable! So far we've only been able to slow down the poison flowing through the victim's bodies. We must devise a cure!Venture northwest to the valley outside of the Vanguard and slay the Forgotten Depths Nerubians. Recover their venom glands and bring them to me.
3238,"An End to the Suffering : My body is too far gone now, <name>. It is only a matter of time before a new prophet is elevated and finishes what the other began.I am going to imbue you with the last of my power. The tormentor inside the altar building carries incense, which will awaken my body and make it vulnerable.Use the incense and do me the kindness of putting an end to my suffering.I apologize if I fight back. Even for me, the will to survive is strong."
3239,"Avenge Me! : I hear them, <brother/sister>....The moans of the wounded Alliance... they taunt me...Finish what we have begun here, <class>. Show no mercy... let none of them survive.For... the Horde..."
3240,"The Cleansing : We braved the Rivenwood because of my troubled dreams concerning my worg life-friend, Ulfang. He has called out for help, and you must go to him.But, you do not have the means to speak with him, or walk amongst the other worgs. I know a way.First, you must cleanse your inner turmoil.There is a shrine that sits at the top of Frostblade Peak, northeast of Camp Winterhoof. A single path leads up to it from the western base of the mountain.Meditate there and then return to me."
3241,"The Runic Keystone : Brann's journal mentions that he used a runic keystone to illuminate the important runes on the plate he discovered. Without the keystone, the plate's contents would be little better than gibberish.At the end of Brann's last entry, he describes the iron dwarf defenders seizing the keystone from him, shattering it, and dividing it among themselves. Before we can decipher the runed plate, we must hunt down the fragments. Any of the dwarves within Thor Modan or the buildings around it may carry fragments."
3242,"Into the Pit : Besting a tethered opponent is one thing.  Fighting other bear riders on equal footing is another.Head into the Pit of the Fang and use what you've learned to defeat your opponents.  Good luck, sister.Glory awaits, should you succeed."
3243,"Pure Evil : We know that Kolramas, the crashed necropolis to the southeast, was carrying a large amount of an ore known as saronite when the trolls shot it down.My scouts tell me that much of the saronite is strewn about within the innards of that thing.Eitrigg and his friends back at The Argent Stand want a bunch of the stuff so that they can study it.I want you to head in there and see if you can collect enough for them."
3244,"I'm Not Dead Yet! : The Light smiles upon me. I have not yet died in this living nightmare, but the Scourge will kill me and tear my body apart for use in their 'work' here if I cannot escape.I cannot make it on my own, my child, but with your help, I may yet live to fight the Scourge again.Will you help me make my escape before the Scourge's butchers come to finish me off?"
3245,"In Search Of Answers : These poor creatures are the only survivors.According to their chief, the Drakkari trolls and Rageclaw wolvar have been allies for thousands of years. They've been living here, alongside the trolls, for generations, completely unaware of the ever changing world around them. To the Rageclaw, a troll is a troll, so the troll attack upon their den took them by surprise.We need some answers, <name>. Scour their village - southeast of here - for clues as to who or what is in charge of these attacks."
3246,"Prevent the Accord : We need to kill two birds with one stone here, <class>. You're the stone.Our two birds are Wind Trader Mu'fah and Goramosh. They should be somewhere in the western half of the Moonrest Gardens. Most likely they're in the larger two-story building overlooking the pit.I require proof of their demise, if you would be so kind."
3247,"Just Around the Corner : Blast it! Where are my tools? I had them here just a moment ago.Oh! I probably forgot them when I was setting up that minefield in the west. That's mildly inconvenient. I'd be quite appreciative if you could go get them for me. You'll need to watch your step though... you should be able to use the same path that I did to get out.Oh, and don't try to fly in... I had the presence of mind to set up turrets to shoot down anything that might fly, and they aren't very discerning in who they target."
3248,"Reconnaissance Flight : It's about time we had planes up and running in this place.  The professor's been asking me to check out a strange weather pattern coming from the northeast.Thing is, I'm going to need a co-pilot if we're going into uncharted territory.  No way in hell I'm heading out there alone.What do you say, <tough-guy/hotshot>?  You might learn a thing or two.  And once you learn to deal with the northern winds... you can pretty much fly anywhere."
3249,"Near Miss : It was either wisdom or luck that prevented you from wearing this choker, <race>.Either way, your acquiring it was no random occurance. You've been targeted by someone, or something....Take your choker to Bloodrose, here. Let her demonstrate the fate that nearly befell you."
3250,"Help Those That Cannot Help Themselves : They're majestic beasts, aren't they?<Lathorius points towards the mammoths of the northern tundra.>With each passing day their numbers diminish. Demons that call themselves hunters slay the beasts for sport and riches.<Lathorius' face contorts with anger.>It's the whimpers that drive me to madness, <name>. You can hear them, carried by the wind. The mammoth calves, trapped in the hunters' vile traps, call out to us.Take this hammer and smash those traps. Free the calves!"
3251,"Let Nothing Go To Waste : The wolvar have always been our natural enemies. But the incursion of your peoples into the Great Dragonblight has forced them into a small space upon the glade to the north.Combined with the land's upheaval this morning, they have become even more aggressive than ever before. They have made several raids upon our goods... things that we'll need if we are to survive the trek from our home here.As a sign of good faith and friendship, retrieve our goods from the Snowfall Glade wolvar."
3252,"Only Partly Forgotten : Oi... it's like there's a propeller in my stomach.I think I can walk, but I got something nasty in my system when I got bit by something in the back of the cave. It was bigger than the other spiders... and brightly colored.Ricket can probably make me an antidote, but she'd need the venom sac from whatever bit me. Would you mind finding it for me? I don't think Tore's coming.I'll just pretend I'm dead here and hopefully they'll leave me alone."
3253,"The Art of Persuasion : It is fortunate you're here, <race>.You see, the Kirin Tor code of conduct frowns upon our taking certain 'extreme' measures - even in desperate times such as these.You, however, as an outsider, are not bound by such restrictions and could take any steps necessary in the retrieval of information.Do what you must. We need to know where Lady Evanor is being held at once!I'll just busy myself organizing these shelves here. Oh, and here, perhaps you'll find this old thing useful...."
3254,"Return of the Lich Hunter : Okay, I going back to Frenzyheart Hill to make sure all Frenzyheart know what you done for wolvar and for Zepik. You great hunter and they dumb to think you not.Go back to hill and talk to Elder Harkek... I make sure he knows you not traitor before any other Frenzyheart.Thank you, Lich Hunter."
3255,Farseer Grimwalker's Spirit : You must go to Magmoth to the east.You must descend into the depths of their caverns.You must speak with Farseer Grimwalker's spirit!
3256,"Where Are They Coming From? : The Lich King's tireless minions labor away night and day to assemble scores of abominations and flesh giants down there in the Fleshwerks.Yet, that is not enough. More and more skeletal constructors keep appearing to increase the pace of work.If we do not discover where they're coming from and how they're able to work so quickly, we'll be overrun before we can act in force. Search to the southeast and see if you can find the source of these skeletons."
3257,"Troll Patrol: The Alchemist's Apprentice : Ahh, you must be the promised patrol. Your timing couldn't be better. I have urgent need of an extra pair of hands.We have a Drakkari prisoner who's been sent here to undergo questioning. Before the interrogation begins, I require assistance in the creation of a truth serum.Creating a truth serum is tricky business, demanding keen instincts, perfect timing, and improvisation at every step.Let me know when you're ready, <race>. And remember, timing is everything!"
3258,"Marked for Death: High Cultist Zangus : I witnessed his treachery with my own eyes! The traitor led an Anub'ar assault on this stronghold, taking out some of my best soldiers.<Gort shakes his head.>He'd been working with the Scourge the whole time and we didn't have a clue! How many more like Zangus are there? We'll find 'em all and when we do...<Gort makes a cutting motion across his neck.>First on the list is Zangus. Our scouts report that he is hiding in The Pit of Narjun, west of here. Find him, kill him, bring me his head."
3259,"Loyal Companions : Fresh blood! Good to meet ya! I've got some work if you've got some time.Off to the east are the Foot Steppes... pretty hard land, but there's quite a group of rhino that graze there. Our birds have a taste for that rhino meat, but it's always a bit dangerous for them to go hunting with all of the proto-drakes that nest around there.If you're keen, head over that way and get some rhino meat, bring it back to the peaks above here, and then use it to feed some of the eagles that nest there."
3260,"The Slithering Darkness : The vile jormungar have taken over most of the Hibernal Cavern.  They are despicable beings... children of Loken, Thorim's scumsucker of a brother.As Thorim's servants we owe it to ourselves to kill these scum where we find them.  You'll find the cavern just east of here, outside the village."
3261,"The Perfect Dissemblance : You may wonder how I can maintain this guise; I use a magic mirror that was loaned to me by the spy mistress.It only has so much power in it, but I think there's enough for the both of us. Here, take it. I want you to use it to impersonate one of the Onslaught raven priests.Be quick about it... I have no idea how long my glamour will last while you have the mirror.Realize that you won't immediately be perfectly disguised, so don't count on it being foolproof until I've had a chance to help you."
3262,"The Restless Dead : Not all of our soldiers made it out of Scourgeholme. Many were slain and turned into twisted reflections of their former selves. Such is the way of the Scourge. For those damned souls, there is no eternal peace. We must provide their souls rest.Travel through the Breach into Scourgeholme and slay the skeletal reanimated crusaders. Sprinkle this holy water on their bones so that their spirits may be freed."
3263,"Strange Mojo : This bottle of strange mojo may be the key to what is truly going on here.The Zandalari troll Hexxer Ubungo, back at The Argent Stand, may want to take a look at it."
3264,"The Stone That Started A Revolution : You may look at Scourgeholme now and see a rancid pit of decay, but one day it will be a place of glory and honor. Highlord Fordring has deemed it ""Justice Keep.""Alas, even an impregnable fortress like Icecrown Citadel began with but a single stone. So begins our search for the stone to start a revolution.Travel to Crystalsong, south of here, and seek out the Unbound Thicket in the east. Once there gather crystalline heartwood from the thicket floor and elven masonry from the Ruins of Shandaral."
3265,"Trainer's Test : <The oracle finishes peering into the pearl and turns to face you. She appears to be deep in thought, staring directly at you and blinking a few times.  Finally, she nods.   The oracle points at you, then points upwards. She places a hand a small distance above the ground, indicating something pet-sized.  Your surmise that there may be test of your connection with your battle pets ahead.>"
3266,"Siphoning the Spirits : You should be happy he's coming, they said. You'll enjoy his company, they said....Well it's not as if I had a choice in the matter. Finklestein is the Crusade's best alchemist. I suppose I should be honored that he's chosen my post to set up shop. But ever since he's arrived, I've been relegated to collecting various alchemical ingredients.Say, <race>, how about you give me a hand? Just south of here are some pools that are haunted by spirits of ancient trolls. Collect their ectoplasm for me."
3267,"Return to the High Commander : Return to High Commander Halford Wyrmbane at once, <name>. Let him know that your mission was a success and that the few remaining villagers that were rescued are back to work."
3268,"Grmmurggll Mrllggrl Glrggl!!! : If your pathetic little eyes were any good, you'd see that we're being slaughtered by the orcas to the north in the bay!Assuming your precious night elf king wants his spare costume back, I think you'll do me a favor and bring back the head of the king of the orcas, Glrggl: he who swims against the tides of fate -- eradicating the hope of life for all those who hear the siren song of death upon the waves!Be quick about it, <race>, Winterfin murlocs are losing their lives even as we waste time talking!"
3269,"A Show of Strength : Preparations for war are underway in the vrykul village of Voldrune to the southeast. Voldrune's thane cannot field a large army, but with our forces spread thin, we are still at risk.We cannot risk giving the thane and his men an opportunity to attack, so we must take the battle to them. If you are truly a <class> of the Horde, you will relish the chance to demonstrate our strength.Cut down the huscarls and prove to this Dragonflayer clan that the Horde is not to be trifled with!"
3270,"I Sense a Disturbance : There's something wrong with Quetz'lun, the wind serpent goddess. What it is exactly I cannot sense, but I do know that her altar has been overrun with powerful creatures.I'm going to send you there on the back of one of my children, which you saved. The two of you will move swiftly and with great stealth to uncover what has become of Quetz'lun.My child will see you safely back to me. Just keep your eyes open.When you are ready, ask and I will call one of my kittens for you."
3271,"Before the Gate of Horror : The Conflagration, the ground before Corp'rethar, south of the Ironwall Rampart, is where the Lich King's elite soldiers have formed up to defend the citadel.Led by a contingent of death knights, a legion of skeletal reavers bars the way. I fear that even when these reavers fall, the Scourge will simply reconstitute them and send them back at us.I've come up with a plan to stop this, but I have no way of knowing if it will work. Take this solution and use it to dissolve the remains of the reavers."
3272,"Chains of the Anub'ar : They have my father bound by magical chains in the middle of Icemist Village. From what I have been able to gather, the prison is controlled by three powerful Anub'ar magi - each holding a piece of the key.Scour Icemist and locate the magi. Kill them and take their key fragments. With all three pieces we might be able to free my father. Once he is free...Retribution will come swiftly."
3273,"The Lost Courier : We're lucky we made it this far, <name>.  We were ambushed by Scourge as soon as we landed.One of our men turned out to be a spy for the Cult of the Damned.  Thassarian appears to have more evidence of cultist infiltration.  Apparently it goes all the way to the top.I've sent one of my best couriers to our outpost in western Dragonblight, but he has not yet returned. I fear he may have fallen to the Scourge. Will you go to Dragonblight and search for him? Courier Lanson is his name."
3274,"Hero's Call: Howling Fjord! : All able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Macalroy in Howling Fjord.  The port town of Valgarde is located in the heart of the Howling Fjord, and it allows for the Alliance to have an advantageous position to strike at the Scourge.  Assist the soldiers stationed there.  Glory to the Alliance!"
3275,"An Intriguing Plan : Prospector Rokar has decided to help us. He's concocted a plan to use the iron dwarves' strength against them.I must admit, our new 'friend' is more insightful than I'd given him credit for. He's correct in that our numbers are too few for a direct attack.Travel to Dun Argol, in the snowy regions to the southeast, and capture all the parts of their war golem blueprints from the iron rune-smiths there. Bring the assembled blueprint to Rokar and we'll see if his plan has any merit."
3276,"Second Chances : I'd heard they have an archbishop in their cathedral, but I had no idea that they'd resurrected and promoted Landgren! The Crimson Cathedral is heavily guarded with only one entrance, so you'll need help.We still need to know where the grand admiral is, but this time we're not taking any chances!Take this device. It can be used to summon a gate for me to step through once you've killed the archbishop.I'll have my answers directly from his compelled soul! We will find Grand Admiral Westwind!"
3277,"Battle Before The Citadel : Even as some of us labor on the tournament, our brothers prepare the way for an assault on the enemy's stronghold of Icecrown Citadel.In the Court of Bones in southwestern Icecrown, a few brave crusaders have set up a forward camp on the southern side of Corp'rethar. Equip your lance and mount the stabled campaign charger at the camp, then destroy the Lich King's commanders.Do not fear the masses of boneguard footmen, <name>, for they can easily be trampled under your horse's hooves."
3278,"Blood Oath of the Horde : They are ready, <name>. These taunka will all willingly join the Horde and give all that they have to see the Scourge driven from this world.<Brighthoof hands you a scroll bearing the insignia of the Horde.>Within this scroll you will find the blood oath of the Horde. Tradition dictates that our new taunka brothers and sisters utter the sacred words herein.Take the scroll and swear the taunka into the Horde, commander. Return the scroll to me when you have completed your duty."
3279,"From the Depths of Azjol-Nerub : The undead Nerubians that attacked Icemist Village came from a gigantic sinkhole known as the Pit of Narjun. If left alone, those fiends will no doubt flank our forces at the Wrathgate and end our march to victory.I need eyes on the ground, <name>. You are to head west and investigate the Pit of Narjun. We need to locate their primary exit point and seal it off! Find me that location."
3280,"Have a Part, Give a Part : Great, now that we've got an engine, we're going to need an assortment of other parts to get her back in flying condition. Don't worry, I know what I'm doing.A good mechanic can hold his creations together with anything, but we're better off if it doesn't come to that.Anyway, those Venture Company dullards have plenty of spare parts for their mining equipment all over Swindlegrin's Dig on the far side of that yellow crystal pillar to the northeast. Scoop up a few and bring them back here."
3281,"Sleeping Giants : I've overheard what you've had to say with Greatmother Ankha. With all due respect, she's not having you go far enough.You must also deal with the vrykul that lie dormant in the Waking Halls beneath Gjalerbron!I have no doubt that the rituals involved with awakening them are the key to their downfall. Most likely the necrolords have some device that you can use to bring the vrykul out of their dormant state prematurely.Surely such a disruption will prove fatal to the vrykul."
3282,"Iron Rune Constructs and You: Rocket Jumping : Alright, <name>; the time has come for you to climb inside this thing and learn how to use its basic abilities. When you're ready, get on the work bench and I'll get you situated inside the construct.Your first lesson is going to be using the construct's transportation system. You'll notice that the iron dwarves have set up special rune carvings around the dig site. Their constructs use those rune carvings to power up and fly from point to point. Try it with the rune carving I built here."
3283,"The Blessing of Zim'Abwa : I am heartened to see the zeal with which your Argent Crusade is dealing with the Scourge, <race>. I would like to help with your efforts.The Drakkari trolls of this once-great city used to make regular offerings to their gods, but now neglect them, or worse.If you were to make offerings to the gods, they would show their appreciation in return.Zim'Abwa's statue is just to the southwest. Zim'Abwa would gladly accept your offerings of Drakkari artifacts as a sign that you are protecting Zul'Drak."
3284,"Darkness Calling : Crafted of bone and dripping with blood, this choker is of intricate and deliberate design.Gazing upon it overwhelms you with an ominous presence - one that compels you to wear it. You fight the urge, and resolve to bring it back to Ebon Watch.If anyone can explain this, a death knight can...."
3285,"The Rune of Command : Can you feel the power emanating from the runes I've carved on this tablet? They're smaller versions of the runes that the Iron Dwarves are using. We'll use it to shut down their operation.Take it to Giants' Run and use it on a stone giant that the dwarves have not altered.The giant should obey you, but I've tailored the runes to restore it to its natural state after a time. The giant may prove a valuable ally in the battle against Binder Murdis, the leader of the Iron Dwarf forces at Giants' Run."
3286,"Do Your Worst : You're going to use this machine against the Scourge?  You're not going to win against them like that.You can destroy hundreds... even thousands of them.  But you won't win.  Not out here.When you're done playing with your machine, meet me to the north.  There is an old army encampment.  What I will show you will teach you a little bit about who you're up against."
3287,"The Staff of Storm's Fury : Those artifacts are cursed and you'd be crazy to go looking for them, <race>. I know for certain that anyone that's come into direct contact with any of those items has either gone mad or been killed.Take that staff, for example. Last I heard the ship that held it was abandoned and left to rot on the coast of the Isle of Spears, north of here.If you want that thing, check the ship's hold.Whatever you do, don't bring that staff back here! And steer clear of Abdul! He'll tear your heart out."
3288,"A Cleansing Song : Earth in Sholazar is pure.  The pillars have protected the land for centuries.Water, not as pure, it comes from outside Sholazar.... from oceans, from lakes, from rivers.  Water sometimes bring bad spirits - need to be cleansed.You take this chime and play at Bittertide Lake, Wintergrasp River and River's Heart.  It make bad spirit angry... and then you must kill it."
3289,"The Valiant's Challenge : You are nearly ready to compete on behalf of Ironforge in the grand melee. To prove yourself worthy to enter the lists on behalf of our city, you must defeat a champion of the Argent Crusade.Go to the stables outside the pavilion, equip your lance, and mount up. Speak to Squire Danny at the Argent Valiants' Ring on the western edge of the grounds. The squire will call out your opponent when you're ready.After the battle is concluded, we will speak of the outcome."
3290,"Plunderbeard's Journal : Whatever was written on the remaining pages of Plunderbeard's journal must be recovered. Search the chambers located on the other side of this tunnel for Plunderbeard's assailants. They must be the ones who tore the journal apart!Should you recover the missing pages, return them to Ambo Cash at the entrance of the Wintergarde Mausoleum."
3291,"Battle at Valhalas: Fallen Heroes : If you believe yourself ready to begin then I have just the match for you to cut your teeth on.Another group of outsiders thought themselves prepared for the rigors of Valhalas. They had much hubris, but in the end they fell like all of the others.If you think yourselves so different -- if you think that you have the skill and experience to fight here amongst such storied warriors -- then please accept the challenge."
3292,"Wipe That Grin Off His Face : We must send Foreman Swindlegrin packing if we're going to shut down his mine permanently, but be careful. His bodyguard, Meatpie, is a large, mean ogre, and  isn't likely to let you see the foreman without a fight.The two probably occupy a platform that would let them look out over the entire Venture Company operation at Swindlegrin's Dig.Remember, the dig is on the far side of the Suntouched Pillar to the northeast. Good luck, <name>."
3293,"Mighty Magnataur : Magnataur are hideously violent creatures... this is the main reason we rarely see them come together in any real numbers without killing each other. A powerful leader has stepped up somewhere among them and we need to hunt him down if we are to stop this threat. I will start asking around. I need you to disrupt them as much as possible in the meantime.East of here there are 3 torches erected. Near them, there are 3 dominant Magnataur - put them down to buy us some time to hunt down this leader."
3294,"The Aberrations Must Die : It is not enough to demonstrate your prowess among your peers.  You must also fight our enemies, dear sister.The Valkyrion traitors continue to mock our noble drake-riding traditions by rearing plagued proto-drakes.Seize the frost oil they wield and use it to freeze their abominable plagued eggs."
3295,
3296,"The Siege : Well, well, well.  It's good to see Arlos bring out the big guns.Don't get me wrong - our lads are doing the best they can, but someone of your renown fighting alongside them could really turn the tides for us.  I'm not sure how much longer we can hold out against these undead Nerubians.What do you say you get out there and kill me some creepers?  Show these boys how it's done."
3297,"Messy Business : Even at first glance, the sample you brought me shows obvious signs of some kind of corrosive spit. It would be a natural assumption that the same substance these worms use to burrow through the ground has allowed them a formidable weapon against the Ice Giants.Take this scraper and pick a fight with some of the worms. When they spit on you, use the scraper to remove it and bring it back to me.Get me a couple samples - I'm going to have to use it as the base for an elixir."
3298,"Fresh Remounts : Hello. I am Hansel. Pleased to meet you, <sir/ma'am>.The high executor came to me and said, 'Hansel, I want you to get us new mounts.'Where does he think dreadsteeds come from? The ground?<whispering> Actually, they do if you can find a horse graveyard.But we don't have one of those, so what we need you to do is go south to New Hearthglen, kill the knights, take their riding crops, and steal their warhorses.Ride the horse back to me here and hand over the reins, if you would."
3299,"The Earthen Oath : For years I neglected my duties, giving into defeat and self-pity.Not the brave earthen, however.  Their oath to protect these grounds with their lives has gone unbroken.Even now, they fight the corruption of iron with selflessness, waiting for the moment in which the tides turn.That moment has arrived.  We must rally what remains of the earthen defenders and lead them into a glorious victory.  Sound the Horn of the Peaks to call them to your side and take back the Terrace of the Makers."
3300,"Shred the Alliance : Read my lips, <class> - I need those shredders! Just as important - I need to keep them out of the hands of the Alliance!They've been refurbishing the shredders and using them against our brothers in Venture Bay. Now we're going to give them a taste of their own medicine!You see a shredder out there, grab it! You see one of the Alliance scum on one, kill 'em and then grab it! Once you have one, drive it back here to me and we'll get to work on it.Dismissed!"
3301,Army of the Damned : You probably think you're quite strong -- fighting these undead and crushing their bones beneath your war machines.That is nothing compared to the strength it took to create them.I saw the prince do it himself.  I can show you how it happened... if you'd like.
3302,"Crocolisk Mastery: The Plan : The mangal crocolisk is a master of the ambush, and I intend to beat the best at his game. To do that, we'll need to construct a convincing camouflage for you. We'll use plants that grow in the sandy soil of the riverbanks and lake beaches.The sandfern is best for this purpose. It grows in the sandy areas near the shores of the Seabreach Flow, just to the south, Bittertide Lake and Bittertide Falls, to the north, and the edges of River's Heart, the large lake beyond the mangal to the east."
3303,"Tools to Get the Job Done : I've been studying this deactivated construct for days, <name>. I think I can create a reasonable facsimile of the golem that would have room inside to fit one passenger. The idea being that it would fool those iron dwarves and allow us to get inside Baelgun's.Now I'm not gonna be able to make anything with a hammer and poker. I need my tools! Unfortunately I left those behind at Ivald's Ruin when the iron dwarves first attacked. Get me my tools!Ivald's Ruin is located far to the northeast."
3304,"The Touch of an Aspect : The dragon-queen, Alexstrasza, possesses magics over all life. In the past, she has used great fire to incinerate undead and rebirth fresh new life in their place. Perhaps her powers might be able to save our Bridenbrad as well.Alexstrasza makes her home at Wyrmrest Temple in Dragonblight - please go to her and humbly request her aid on my behalf."
3305,"Into the Mist : Across the mist to the north you will find Garrosh's Landing. To the south are the ruins of my old home, Pal'ea. Both have been ransacked by an ancient force known as the Kvaldir.These fearsome savages slew all of my people without mercy and drove your people inland.All that remains of the tuskarr of Pal'ea are our personal effects, taken as relics by the Kvaldir. While we are not a vengeful race, justice must be served. The tuskarr relics must be returned to me. Enter the mist and find them..."
3306,"Out of Body Experience : Ah, you seek a vision of the past.  You're a wise <race>.Every time someone drops by for a reading, they seem to always ask about the future.  When you get to be my age, you learn that scrying the past, more often than not, is more useful.Drink this potion and peer into my crystal ball.  Let us see what knowledge we can obtain."
3307,"Let Them Eat Crow : The high executor wants me to use my dogs to sniff out enemy scouts, but I can tell you right now these plaguehounds aren't going anywhere until they're properly fed.If our military doesn't understand that these beasts are picky enough to not eat the rubbish they've given me, then they can't expect them to be of any use in the field.You seem to have some time on your hands, why don't you take one of these dogs out hunting for crows out west?  Their meat isn't very tasty to us, but my boys love it!"
3308,"Reunited : You look at me and see I am no great warrior. Why was I chosen to be a Paragon? Not all weapons can be seen, Wakener. One should not judge by appearance alone.Before I explain further, I need to know that you are trustworthy.Something precious to me was hidden at the time of my preservation. I am nothing without it.Defend me as I unearth my greatest weapon, and you will have my trust."
3309,"The Captive Prospectors : Raegar sent a team of prospectors into Dun Argol to search for artifacts and information about the history of the settlement. Raegar's team never expected Dun Argol to be this heavily populated.They're being held captive while the iron dwarves prepare for war. We haven't the men to charge in after them, and Raegar's too busy fantasizing about defeating the irons to be of much help.It falls to you, <name>. Any of the irons or their servants could be carrying the keys to the cages holding our men."
3310,"To Conquest Hold, But Be Careful! : I've received a request for help from our base in the Grizzly Hills. I'm sending you to see Conqueror Krenna.<The high executor waves a sheaf of parchment in the air as if he could care less what is written on it.>She's attempting to secure all of the natural resources or somesuch. Just watch your back around her. The word is that she's aggressive even for an orc.Follow the road east and then southeast. Cross the bridge at the Dragonspine Tributary and go east from the Evergreen Trading Post."
3311,"Unwelcome Guests : Our scouts have spotted iron dwarves in the valley north of here. I overheard King Stormheart sending you to visit Drom and I'm admittedly a bit worried about'm.If you find any iron dwarves when you head down there, put'm down hard and fast for me, eh? I dun think they know exactly where we are or how to get here just yet, and I'd prefer to keep it that way."
3312,"In Memoriam : Surely Thorim has told you of the tragedy that divides us.It was in Thunderfall, northeast of here, that these events unfolded. The frozen fossils there are a reminder of that dark day, as are the spirits that haunt that place.If my people are to forgive Thorim, something must take the place of those images. A memorial must be constructed to bring our hearts peace.Go there, <race>. Collect the fragments of Hodir's Horn that was shattered that day."
3313,"Culling Jorcuttar : The jormungar are a nuisance best dealt with quickly. If given any quarter, they breed like hares and spread like fire.They have appeared southwest of here, in the Hibernal Cavern. If their spawnmother is not slain soon, they will gain a foothold in our region.She cannot refuse food. Take this knife and get the flank of a bear corpse from their cave. Place it near her crater and kill her as she feeds."
3314,Back to the Pit : To truly stay in your best riding shape you'll want to test yourself against the other Hyldnir every day.Head back into the Pit of the Fang and show them what you're capable of.  They'll appreciate suffering defeat to one as skilled as yourself.
3315,"Report to Lord Devrestrasz : I abhor the loss of life... any life. But I will not stand idly by and allow Malygos to kill us and defile the temple!I have appointed Lord Devrestrasz as the commander of Wyrmrest's defenses.Speak with Torastrasza to ride a drake down to him.Please lend him your aid, <name>. Your involvement with the defense of Wyrmrest will be critical to us prevailing against the blue dragonflight."
3316,"Once More Unto The Breach, Hero : The Vanguard is secure, ally. We have reclaimed the Valley of Echoes and taken down the web walls blocking entry to the Breach. Now is the time to strike at Scourgeholme and establish our presence inside Icecrown. The battlefront moves on!I have asked the Ebon Watcher for his assistance with our assault upon Scourgeholme. His intimate knowledge of the Scourge will be invaluable in our effort.Go now and report to him at the tent outside of the Breach, northwest of here."
3317,"Tactical Clemency : Listen, <name>.  I need you to act with discretion and speed.One of Krenna's top sergeants has captured a trapper outcast outside of Silverbrook.  Now, if things turn out the way they usually do, the prisoner is going to be executed before the day is over.We can't let that happen.  You see, the prisoner matches the description of Mikhail's older daughter in his diary.If we set her loose and follow her closely, she'll lead us to whoever's controlling the trappers.  Take this letter to her."
3318,"The Hidden Relic : During your absence, I was privileged enough to parley with the dwarf Brann Bronzebeard. This dwarf indicated his purpose for seeking the keystone, and I am satisfied that it is for satisfactory intent... I believe this dwarf may be the entity for which the keystone was created.Norgannon's Core is located in the Frigid Tomb to the southeast. Its guardians are ancient beings of ice, and they will not welcome your presence. Best these guardians and retrieve the keystone with my blessing, <race>."
3319,"Time for Answers : You have a lot of questions, <name>.  You're the only one who can see me because you touched something that once belonged to him... don't you remember?You don't know what it is?  Well I can't just tell you... that would make him really mad.  He's not just a prince anymore... he's the king!Meet me at the Court of Bones, north of Icecrown Citadel and you can see for yourself."
3320,"The Lost Mistwhisper Treasure : So some puppy-men come and smash blue crystals at Great Mist Stone! Lots of rain and lightning and badness... blue is wrong crystal for Great Mist Stone! Dumb puppy-men.After lightning, puppy-men stole big treasure we found in the sea-lake. We need treasure back to give to Great Mist Stone! Mist Stone is angry after what the puppy-men did!One who took it named Tarter... no, Tiktak... no, no... Tartek. That it, Tartek! He went to the camp thing to north. Go get treasure back!"
3321,"Fate of the Titans : Norgannon's Core is not at this location. I am not sure why you seek it, <race>, and I am equally unsure if you truly know the purpose of that which you seek.I would like you to aid me before I consider extending my assistance.  I have recently encountered knowledge of the watcher, Thorim. His seat of power is contested, and his fate remains to be seen. This troubles me, for I do not know of the other watchers. Utilize this databank to examine their temples to the northeast and return the knowledge to me."
3322,"The Fate of the Ruby Dragonshrine : As you pick up the brooch, its faint glow brightens slightly.Krasus will want to know of Dahlia's fate. Take the brooch to him at Wyrmrest."
3323,"The Sky Will Know : I must find out what happened to my master, Farseer Grimwalker!Earlier, he was observing the magnataur at nearby Magmoth. But one of his grunts just returned, saying that the group had been crushed, and that the farseer was dragged into the depths of the place.Before I send you on a suicide mission, I wish to consult with the spirits to learn more.There is an air elemental known as Imperean in the ruins of Eldra'nath to the west. She is wise and may give you the information we seek."
3324,"Argent Crusade, We Are Leaving! : <The sergeant quickly reads through the orders you've handed him, a frown coming over his face.>Look, <lad/lass>, I'd love to just up and leave, but take a look out there. All of my people are fighting.Tell you what, you've come this far, you think you're up to doing me a small favor? Head out there and round up my soldiers?Tell 'em that the sergeant orders them to report back immediately. Lend them a hand if you will."
3325,"There's Something Going On In Those Caves : So, while you were out taking care of those plagued beasts, I took a peek inside the caves up there.There are cultists in there plaguing them!They have some sort of noxious concoction brewing in a cauldron. I have a powder that I normally use as an anti-poison, and I mixed it up with some other stuff. I think it'll neutralize their brew!Take it up to one of those caves and see if it works."
3326,"Assault by Ground : Greetings <class>.Our troops have been attempting to storm Ymirheim for some time, but these vrykul are far more vicious than any we've faced before. They've been ambushing us repeatedly as we try to make it up the pass, and we've lost a lot of men.If you want to lend yourself to the battle and help get my squad to the gates of Ymirheim safely, we will gladly reward you for your efforts. Once at the gates, we'll dig in and wait for reinforcements to catch up to us."
3327,"Neutralizing the Plague : You no longer need my assistance in neutralizing the enemy's plague cauldrons, <race>.Hunt down the flesh giants at the death gate and use the fluid from their spines to render batches of the plague ineffective.You are striking at the heart of the enemy's strategy. This is an important mission - vital to our cause, and should be carried out whenever time permits.Remember, the giants and the plague cauldrons can be found on Mord'rethar."
3328,"Secrets of the Ancients : It's become clear that the instability in the region has had an effect on its indigenous creatures.I've taken a particular interest in the Glacial Ancients and their recent adaptations. I suspect that their transformation into these 'Magic-bound' Ancients may hold clues to our predicament here.For my studies, I'll need samples from both. Do hurry...."
3329,"We Have the Technology : While the infrastructure for a piece of machinery like this is important, we can't underestimate the appearance of the construct. If we're to fool the iron dwarves the clone must be exact!I can make this happen.Bring me a pristine shoveltusk hide from the shoveltusk of this region and steel ribbing from vrykul in Nifflevar or Baleheim to the northwest."
3330,"Orik Trueheart and the Forgotten Shore : I have gazed upon the orb and seen the path that you must walk, <name>.Many years ago an atrocity was committed upon the shores of Dragonblight. The act itself remains shrouded in darkness, but I am certain that your destiny lies south, amidst the ruins of the Forgotten Shore.Take the road southeast through the ravaged town square. Follow the trail until you arrive at Dawn's Reach. You will meet an old friend of mine there known as Orik Trueheart. He will be expecting you."
3331,"Return My Remains : <name>, now that my spirit has been freed would you do me the honor of returning my remains to Spirit Talker Snarlfang? They lay upon the ground beneath me.I sense that the spirit talker is still at Bor'gorok Outpost to the west where last I saw her."

Down at luxurious K3, they're always making innovative inventions and finding all-new ways to make things blow up! Sounds thrilling, doesn't it? If you want to be part of the fun, head on down today and speak to Jeer Sparksocket!Mandatory disclaimer: manual labor may be required to partake in previously indicated ""excitement."""
3333,"Sirana Iceshriek : This Sirana Iceshriek sounds like the one that's spurring the harpies to be more aggressive. If we kill her, I suspect their attacks won't last long afterwards.One of our stormriders claims to have spotted her circling the peak directly northwest of here.  Go find the wench and put her down. Let's see this done."
3334,"Do Unto Others : Their attack is imminent, <class>. I need you to get in there and sever the head of the Scarlet Onslaught, literally!It's not going to be easy... Abbendis is sure to be surrounded by a great many of her men.Bring back her head and I'll see to it that you're properly rewarded for saving Venomspite.Fail and don't even bother to return!"
3335,"The Trident of Naz'jan : Five hundred years ago, Azshara imprisoned a being named Leviroth in the waters below.  Now these barbarians seek to undo our queen's work!They took over our city and began to sacrifice my brethren to awaken him!  When they ran out of naga, they began to take tuskarr.  Their spirits will know no peace!I will help you, for it will go a long way towards quelling my vengeance.  Their captain, Ragnar, dwells deep inside northeastern Riplash.  He has in his possession a golden trident.  Bring it to me!"
3336,"The Boon of Remulos : I shall open a portal to take you back to the druid that brought you here. You and your crusader have my well wishes. I hope that this acorn is able to purify your crusader and save him from the wretched fate of the plague.Farewell, <race>."

Make your way to the Stormwind Docks and take the ship north to Valiance Keep.For the glory and honor of the Alliance!"
3338,"Keeper Witherleaf : You have been a great friend and ally to us, <name>. There is one more thing I must ask of you.You have seen the corruption of the Twisted Glade and the beasts that dwell there. The blacksouled keepers will continue raising these abominations from the waters and soil of our glade unless we act against them.The most powerful of the blacksouled keepers is known as Keeper Witherleaf. Slay him, <name>, and open the way for the redemption of the glade as you once redeemed my sisters."
3339,"My Enemy's Friend : If there is one thing I can get through your head, let it be this: the Alliance will be crushed in the Grizzly Hills.There is far too much lumber, ore, game and strategic territory for us to give up on any single battlefront here.So far we've been successful... but there's something that could tip the scales in our enemy's favor.Far to the east  of here, at the Forest Edge's Post, local trappers seek to join the Alliance.  Slaughter them before they have the chance to do so."
3340,"Dragonspeak : I am aware of your recent deeds here, <name>, and again I thank you.As for this local menace, we've learned all we need to know from them. They'll be dealt with in short order. On now to more important issues....Azeroth needs you. The region just west of here is the center of an urgent crisis.I'll leave the details to Lord Surristrasz. You must speak with him at once.Good luck, friend of Dalaran."
3341,"Danger! Explosives! : <name>, the captain's tasked me with a mission. I'd like you to help.A bunch of my fellow Explorers' League people went nuts digging up stuff in the Whisper Gulch just to the north. They're attacking anyone trying to get in!The captain is only concerned with the ore for the keep. Lucky for us, I have just the thing to do the trick.Get in there, blow up the ore, and bring it back along with any gems you find. Running this place isn't cheap you know!I gotta warn you though, that ore is strange!"
3342,"Enemies of the Light : Not so fast there.  I don't know about you, <class>, but I was hardly convinced by the general's words.  They rung unsure... as if they were not his own.Something's amiss here.  All of our efforts to collaborate have been blocked and delayed.  It is time we took a more independent approach.If we're to learn more about the cultists inside the keep... perhaps we should investigate those outside.Intelligence reports a small group of them aiding the Scourge north of here.  See if they carry any clues."
3343,"Aberrations : The Lich King sent emissaries to us on three different occasions.  All three were promptly dismembered.Our sisters in Valkyrion were not as dedicated to our traditions and accepted the Scourge's advances.  Now instead of capturing their drakes from the wild, they raise them from the blight and filth that the Scourge wallow in.Take the frost oil that the Valkyrion Hyldnir carry on them and use it to freeze any blighted eggs you find.  Rumors speak of a fetid pool of blight where the eggs are kept."
3344,"Burning to Help : There's no more caustic material in all of the basin than bittertide hydra sputum. I've got special containers to collect just such a thing for Archmage Pentarus' studies. Now all I need is a brave, um... collector.You look like a hardy, adventurous <class>. How'd you like to make a bit of money and aid Dalaran's cause at the same time?All you need to do is take this container with you to Bittertide Lake, to the southwest. Engage the hydra and use the container to sample the sputum they shower you with."
3345,"And Then There Were Two... : There's no sign of the cipher on Zedd. After carefully searching the area you discover some writing in the dirt:""Glor and Dae inside catacombs. Have cipher and tablets.""Perhaps you should head into the catacombs located just north of here and search for Glorenfeld and Daegarn. The bridge crossing the worg pit will lead you right to the tunnel leading down into the catacombs."
3346,"Lumber Hack : Next up, we need to haul in some lumber for all the towers the Alliance are building.  There are some thin trees to the south, but the trees the harpies are nesting in to the north look much more fit for structures.Take this.  When you get to the harpy nesting area, use the control and one of my Shredders should come to you.  Gather as much lumber as it can carry.  The harpies are sure to disagree with you chopping down their homes - just deal with them as necessary.Hop to it!"
3347,"Cannot Reproduce : I smell their cauldrons from here, but that's not plague they're cooking.Pledges to the cult are forced to drink a concoction that steals their will and enslaves them forever to the Lich King.Some say the potion contains the twisted soul of a being who was tormented before being mercilessly slaughtered, but I've never been able to reproduce it...Fill this flask with a sample from each of the three cauldrons in the northwest region of the gate and bring it to Chief Engineer Copperclaw."
3348,"Relief for the Fallen : The refuge's defenders fight bravely, but they cannot keep up with the iron onslaught.With the earth you collected, I can make bandages to help heal the wounds of some of the fallen. The more defenders we can patch up, the longer we'll last out there.Take these poultices and use them to heal the wounds of the fallen defenders outside the refuge. Get as many back into the battle as possible, <name>. Every casualty is one too many."
3349,"Lightning Infused Relics : Your construct is ready to go. All abilities have been given a once over and I've programmed the machine to both comprehend and speak the language of the titans.Take the construct to Baelgun's Excavation Site, due south of here, and collect data from the lightning infused relics that litter the site. Remember to bluff any iron dwarves that suspect your construct to be a fake. And don't forget about rocket jumping from rune to rune to get around in there!Get on the table when you're ready!"
3350,"Friends in Dalaran : Welcome to Northrend. I have been asked to arrange travel for you to Dalaran so that you can meet our friends in the city.Speak with me and accept a ride to Dalaran. Once you land, make your way to The Filthy Animal.Make contact with Uda the Beast immediately.She can help you bind your hearthstone to the city so you can use the portal in Sunreaver's Sanctuary to travel back to Orgrimmar quickly."
3351,"Malas the Corrupter : <name>, head back down there!You'll find the leader of Kolramas, Malas the Corrupter, gloating from atop the crashed necropolis.Kill him and bring me his head!"
3352,"Buying Some Time : Now that we have this phylactery, I shouldn't have any problems getting the information I need.  It won't take long for the Scourge in the Temple City to notice something's up, however.I won't be able to fend off a full scale attack here.  Or maybe I would... but I'd rather not find out.I want you to head down there and inflict some casualties.  Hopefully they'll be distracted long enough for these two to spill their guts... figuratively, of course.  Take Lurid with you, he might be of aid."
3353,"The Iron Thane and His Anvil : Now that you've charged up your war golem, we're going to put all that energy to good use. Activate the golem inside Dun Argol to take control of it.Our  information about Dun Argol's leader, Iron Thane Furyhammer, suggests his bodyguard protects him from all harm.That bodyguard is the construct he travels with, called The Anvil. Disable the construct, and his protection will disappear.The thane stays in the building at the top of Dun Argol and supervises production from the bottom level."
3354,"We Call Him Steelfeather : We see one brave hippogryph circling over the fort, then swooping down and taking prey. Jethan over there has taken a couple of shots at the creature, but his arrows bounced right off!We've taken to calling this remarkable creature Steelfeather, but we can't see why he prefers the area around Fort Wildervar. Most hippogryphs are wary of people.Researcher Aderan has helped us fashion a charm from one of the creature's feathers. He claims it will allow the user to see through Steelfeather's eyes."
3355,"An Offering for Soo-rahm : We not know you, stranger, but we know you want something.We will talk to Bones of Nozronn for you, but you must bring us offerings. We need powerful emperor cobra fangs to complete our oracle's necklace.Go to the Wildgrowth Mangal, northeast of our hut, find cobras and bring back best fangs. Then we make bones speak to you."
3356,"The Ancient Armor of the Kvaldir : I was on the vessel that was bringing in the armor. We'd just boarded the ship and were headin' back here when we were attacked by a Forsaken destroyer.They boarded our ship, took all the booty for themselves, and then sunk her.That was the last I'd seen of that armor. If you want, you can take my bomber from Scalawag to the dreaded isle that the destroyer be docked. Talk to my woman, Alanya, outside. She'll get you on the bomber.If you manage to find the stuff, don't you dare bring it back!"
3357,"Kartak's Rampage : You the great Lich Hunter, eh? Good to have such strong Frenzyheart ally for battle. Maybe you strong enough to call Kartak even.Big battle at Kartak's Hold to southwest.  Go kill spark big-tongues until you get good bit of Oracle Blood. Bring blood to altar in Kartak's Hold to call Kartak for delicious feast of big-tongue.Kartak take your body if you worthy... with Kartak's powers, you slaughter more big-tongues than even best dreams.Go kill lots, hunter!"
3358,"The Horn of Elemental Fury : I can fashion the likeness of an elemental from these pieces of inanimate stone, but breathing life into it is different. For that, we'll need help and a bit of luck.Legend tells of an ancient artifact called the Horn of Elemental Fury, sought after by a great hero. I'll lend you a scroll with a copy of the tale. I don't know if the legend is true, but it's our best bet. If the legend is right, the parts of the horn may be in the Flood Plains surrounding the village to the north and southwest."
3359,"Clipping Their Wings : Ever since Finklestein's arrival, I've been relegated to collecting various ingredients for his experiments and recipes.I'll follow my orders as I've vowed to do, but I'm a seasoned veteran. I've taken part in dozens of conflicts. I'd much rather be on the front lines, having a more direct impact on the Crusade's outcome here.Help me, <race>. Collect some bat wings for me so that I might get back to the real action sooner."
3360,"Guide Our Sights : We should be able to kill our way back to our guns.  Unfortunately, visibility is less than desirable so you will have to mark our targets from the ground.Take these smoke flares with you and use them to mark the locations of the cannons along the northern wall in the Derelict Strand, west of here, where the Alliance are holding out.Let Lyana know as soon as the way is clear for the ground troops.  We can take care of ourselves over here."
3361,"Your Attention, Please : Chief Engineer Boltwrench has proven invaluable in his service aboard the Stormbreaker. Were it not for his ingenuity, we'd be sprinkled across half of the glacier several times over by now.The thing is, he feels he must share his every miniscule invention or discovery - most of which I don't even understand.My focus must be squarely on our enemies right now. I cannot afford any distractions.Please visit him in my stead, <name>. And if you can, assist him. You'll find him belowdecks."
3362,"The Sub-Chieftains : It is known that Gearmaster Mechazod has four sub-chieftains that manage the robots in the pools.We must put an end to them!Our longrunners and snow trackers say that if you were to turn the valves at the west point, north point, mid point and south point stations, each of his sub-chieftains would come quickly to prevent you from fouling their operations.The stations are centered on the spinning lights in the pools surrounding the pumping station.Hurry, <name>!"
3363,"Nuts for Berries : Oh! What a relief it is to see a fresh face. I was beginning to feel we had been forsaken.Our supply lines were cut off days ago, and things have been looking - well, bleak. To be honest, this was a suicide mission to begin with if you ask me.Maybe I'm simply not cut out for all of this violence - to say nothing of the bitter cold! I'd much rather be back in Dalaran studying ancient texts.To the point, our food supply is nearly spent. Please, gather what you can and bring it to me."
3364,"The One That Got Away : The barbfish you brought should work well as bait for most fish, but I fear it'll attract a monster!When I first arrived, I put some of Nat Pagle's favorite bait on my hook and cast it into the water. A huge monster latched on, with giant teeth and icicles hanging from its fins!Would've pulled me into those icy waters if I hadn't cut the line! I can't use the new bait until ol' Frostfin's been dealt with. Use this bait near the sunken boat in the middle of the lake. He won't be able to resist!"
3365,"Fire Upon the Waters : I have another mission for you.I was able to repurpose some of the blight to concoct my world-famous burning water. I want you to take it and set the sails of the Sinner's Folly ablaze!Use it from the dock. Once the sails are on fire, the deckhands will be busy putting them out, and you'll slip belowdecks to 'retrieve' the captain's rutters.You'll find the ship on Crusader's Landing, below and south of New Hearthglen. Look for the captain's quarters on the first lower deck, behind the stairs."
3366,"A New Beginning : It remains uncertain whether or not our people can ever rekindle the affection we once held for Thorim.May this armor, if nothing else, remind him of the days when we stood together in honor, invincible."
3367,"A Minor Substitution : Krenna, she be wantin' worg hides for all the outfits.  There's not gonna be enough worg hides for her army, though.  Not now, not ever.Those worgs -- they be skinny, mon!  Here's what we're gonna do... if you can keep a secret that is.East of Voldrune there be grizzly bears as fat as an ogre.  Those large hides -- those we can use!Hurry, <brother/sister>.  Krenna's not known for her patience."
3368,"Tools of War : Zepik tell me that you maybe the best gorloc hunter he met... other than Zepik. Still big battle to southwest - you go help.Zepik keeps some of biggest, baddest traps in his stash at Kartak's Hold... told Vekgar to use them for battle, so you use them too. Go pick out any traps you want and kill lots of big-tongues.Lots and lots!"
3369,"Cutting Off the Source : Aerial reconnaissance of the quarry reports that the Nerubians are storing their eggs on the scaffolding surrounding the base. Smart beasts these are... They're keeping the eggs high and dry, away from the epicenter of conflict.You're going to have to go back out there and track down their eggs. Find 'em, smash 'em, and trash 'em.Each egg destroyed means twenty less Nerubians feeding on our corpses."
3370,"Keep Them at Bay! : We cannot permit the Horde to control Venture Bay. The port is essential to our operations in Grizzly Hills and beyond.Captain Stoutmantle has taken the rest of the Westfall Brigade east in search of a passage through the mountains, so we'll have no reinforcements.Go into the field, <name>, and kill the Conquest Hold berserkers the Horde has sent against us. Cut them down until none remain standing. The Alliance must have this port!"
3371,"By Fire Be Purged : The Scourge uses our own fallen against us, by raising them as ghouls or skeletons, or by dismembering their corpses and using the parts to make abominations. This must stop!The dead are heroes who fell in defense of all the living, and they cannot be confined to so grisly a fate. Moreover, we cannot afford to face them again on the field, used as weapons against us. Take this torch with you to the Fleshwerks, and burn any of the corpses you find in the Sanctum of Reanimation or the abomination lab."
3372,"Back So Soon? : <High-Oracle Soo-say stares at your forehead for a while before speaking.>Soo-gan ask for help. We think they might have been attacked by puppy-men again.We sending you and Jaloot to help... follow west river up to Mistwhisper Refuge. Do what Soo-gan says... hit the puppy-men on the nose if they being mean, they don't like that.<High-Oracle Soo-say goes back to staring at your forehead as you leave.>"
3373,"The Armor's Secrets : The presence of that armor plate is disorienting, but we need to find out all we can from it. It could be part of one of Valduran's schemes.He's dedicated an extraordinary amount of effort to mining, refining, smithing, and testing this metal.To the east, along the northern mountain face, is a building called Mimir's Workshop. It hasn't been used in quite some time, but if we're lucky, some of its attendants are still functional. Take your armor plate there and learn what you can from it."
3374,"Imbeciles Abound! : The shipment from New Agamand was to arrive at Venomspite last week and then be delivered to me after some simple field tests. It is a Horde imperative - the last piece of the ""victory puzzle.""<Sintar sighs.>It is quite disheartening to know that you are surrounded by imbeciles and incompetent boobs!You must travel to Venomspite, near the eastern border of Dragonblight. Find that buffoon, Middleton, and let him know that I am waiting on the package."
3375,"At The Enemy's Gates : Even as we ready for the tournament, Argent Crusade forces prepare the way for an assault on the enemy's stronghold of Icecrown Citadel.In the Court of Bones in southwestern Icecrown, a few brave crusaders have set up a forward camp on the southern side of Corp'rethar. Equip your lance and mount the stabled campaign charger at the camp, then destroy the Lich King's minions.Do not fear the masses of boneguard footmen, <name>, for they can easily be trampled under your horse's hooves."
3376,"A Visit to the Doctor : So they've been embedding these ghouls with broken shards of saronite down in the Sanctum of Reanimation? We must put a stop to this, before these ghouls can be deployed against our troops.Find the entrance to the Sanctum of Reanimation in the flesh giant lab area of the Fleshwerks. There, the ghoul mastermind, Doctor Sabnok, keeps the most fearsome of his creations, Patches. Free Patches from his chains and help him take his revenge on the doctor. Let his own creation be his undoing."
3377,"War is Hell : We're slowly finishing off the remnants of Stormwind's North Fleet stationed on this coast.  The bodies to the west are a testament to how brutal this confrontation has been.This does not happen to bother my refined aesthetics, but it does present a danger to our lives.In the lands of the Lich King, the dead are a weapon that can rise against us at any point in time.  Take this torch - you're going to make sure that doesn't happen."
3378,"Attack by Air! : They have seen the might of the Horde by land, now they must feel it from the air! I want you to report to Valnok Windrager at once! You will find him here, in Agmar's Hammer.Valnok has already been briefed on your mission and is expecting you."
3379,"Demolishing Megalith : Binder Murdis created Megalith to be a kind of keystone for the runed giants and to lead them in their mission. Defeating Megalith will leave them lost and without direction. I will ask Chieftain Ashtotem to divert some of our men as we move north and dedicate them to eliminating the last of the runed giants. Without their giants, the Iron Dwarves cannot stand against us.Search the foothills of Frostblade Peak, north of Giants' Run for Megalith and defeat him!"
3380,"A Certain Prisoner : You are without mercy.  You will do well around these parts.I have another task to ask of you.  There is a female vrykul prisoner that's become more of a liability than I had anticipated.She had the gall to claim the right to take part in the Hyldsmeet, our sacred competition of strength and fighting prowess.Here's the key to her shackles.  Make it as painless as possible.  She's a female after all, even if not one of us."
3381,"Into the Breach : If we can't overcome the defenders inside Thor Modan, the iron dwarves can hold out forever. The Earthen are bravely taking on the constructs built by the sons of iron, but they cannot break into the city.The tunnels narrow too quickly for my fellow giants to be of use, so our options are few. Would you be willing to venture into the city and kill the dwarf commanding the resistance?"
3382,"My Old Enemy : My old enemy, High General Abbendis, has come to Northrend.Somehow she survived the attacks upon Tyr's Hand and brought a small force north. They've established New Hearthglen to the south.While they could prove useful in fighting the Scourge, Abbendis herself is far too shrewd an opponent to let live. Trust me, if we let them stand, she will be at our throats before the dust settles.So, we'll deprive them of their leadership and go about our business. Bring me her head as proof."
3383,"Ears of Our Enemies : Whether they be treasure seekers or bloodthirsty hunters of the wastes, any being that supports Nesingwary and dares to strike at our beloved wildlife shall be considered an enemy of D.E.H.T.A.Should you slay these filthy Nesingwary sympathizers, bring me proof of their demise and you shall be rewarded with a blessing from the druids of D.E.H.T.A."
3384,"Borrowed Technology : I get it, I get it. Cappy's too busy to see this for himself. His loss!See, I've managed to 'acquire' a certain shipment of solution from the enemy. And as much as I hate tinkerin' with inferior goblin technology, I'm inclined to make an exception here.Take this sample. I'll need you to run a few field tests, just to prove its usefulness, while I try to do a little reverse engineering to duplicate the creation process.Go to the front and gather the materials to make a decoy, then use the oil."
3385,"Emergency Extraction : Now, back to the matter at hand...I am convinced that the vision in the Nexus is one of Deathwing's illusions designed to bring conflict into our flight at a very fragile time.The Worldbreaker would only be strengthened were we to fall to infighting.Still, a gnawing sense of unease tempts me to take a path of caution.It would be wise for me to take Tarecgosa and withdraw until the time of choosing."
3386,"Everfrost : This piece of ice has been submitted to immense pressures and exposed to natural magics from deep beneath the world's surface. In combination, these effects have yielded an ice that will never melt.Knowing little of these things, you resolve to bring the sample back to Dun Niffelem. Someone there is bound to be familiar with its properties."
3387,"The Scourgestone : A Scourgestone is an item given to all Scourge upon birth or creation. It provides certain benefits to the holder, but more importantly it allows Scourge leaders visibility into the location and movement of all of their units.With enough Scourgestones, I might be able to track the movement of other Scourge units across Icecrown.As you slaughter Scourge in Scourgeholme, gather all of the Scourgestones that you find. Return to me when your bags are full."
3388,"Dark Horizon : Ahh, another supplicant answerin' da Lich King's call.<Drakuru sniffs you.>Freshly scourged, eh? Ya still be reekin' of da living!Long be da line of dem who seek da Lich King's blessings. Ya must rise above da masses and prove yerself worthy of wieldin' true power.Lookin' down over Zul'Drak, I sensed potential in ya. I ordered your - invitation.Da rest be up ta you....Go an' speak ta Gorebag for a tour of Zul'Drak. Dere be much ta do if you're to be of any worth to me."
3389,"Field Repairs : The Scourge is still reeling from our attack, <name>.  Now is the time to capitalize on our momentum.The strategically important valley below us is wide open.  We've located a disassembled demolisher vehicle in what we believe is working condition in the southeastern corner of the Valley of Lost Hope area.If you can get the remaining parts from the Scourge scavengers, you should be able to get it running again.  A single working demolisher can wreak havoc on the enemy's ground units."
3390,"Basic Training : This is war, mortal, and we are the tip of the spear.Your little spats over land or currency pale in comparison to this conflict. We face the aspect Malygos and his entire blue dragonflight. All you need to know is that if he is victorious, this world shall be no more.We are but few here, and we fly against many. Our deaths are all but a certainty, and our ultimate success lies in merely delaying our enemy.Go now. Busy yourself while I decide what to do with you."
3391,"Grezzix Spindlesnap : The pirate thieves have set up port at Scalawag Point, far to the south. Unfortunately, they have fortified their camp with many deadly defenses.There is someone that might be able to assist us in infiltrating Scalawag.A pirate mercenary by the name of Grezzix Spindlesnap recently came to our village in search of food and shelter. In exchange he gives us information about our enemies and feeds them misinformation about our attack plans. Seek him out at his ship just off the coast here - southwest."
3392,"Territorial Trespass : Veranus is proud like no other beast I've known.  She still keeps her old nest and makes sure none of the younger proto-drakes takes it over.Take the eggs you've collected and place them on her nest.  You'll find it atop a small peak, directly southeast of here.I should be able to get control of her before she kills you in a fit of rage.  Hopefully."
3393,"Vereth the Cunning : I've already heard some rumors regarding Malykriss and Arthas's new death knight order, but I assumed it nothing more than filling the void. These numbers suggest he's trying to take it up a notch though.We dispatched one of our best to Malykriss not long ago - Vereth the Cunning. You should be able to find him on the Rise of Suffering, just west of Malykriss, and inside the Court of Bones.Try not to draw too much attention on your way in."
3394,"Stocking the Shelves : Listen, <class>. I realize that it's a lot to ask....Fresh spider ichor is somewhat hard to come by, even in these heavily infested regions. But Finklestein said he'd settle for no less than a vat of it, and that he needs it soon.I'll keep my men out in the field collecting reagents, but if the alchemist's order is going to be filled in time, they'll require some assistance.As you roam the fields of Zul'Drak, keep your eyes peeled for trapdoor crawlers and bring me all of the ichor you can find."
3395,"Burn Skorn, Burn! : Chieftain Ashtotem ordered me to destroy many buildings here.However, you are in charge, so it falls to your hands, <name>.I suggest that we burn down the two longhouses and the barracks that are in the lower area of Skorn. All we have to do is get inside each and set them ablaze with this torch."
3396,"Warning: Some Assembly Required : Well, here you are!  Our friend's going to be somewhat... unstable.  So I suggest not putting him together until reaching Halgrind.Once you're there, use the abomination to round up as many vrykul as you can before self-destructing.Come back with whatever's left once you're done.  I can always use more body parts!"
3397,"Powering the Waygate - The Makers' Perch : It is time then.  Let us activate the waygate.You will find the first switch inside the Makers' Perch in the western edge of the basin.Beware, <name>.  The titans used the perch to watch over their creations.  Many of their stone servants still guard the place."
3398,"Prepare for Glory : This is it then.  I'll take care of your bear now, you won't be needing her.  The great Drakkensryd will be your next challenge.Say goodbye to your friends and leave your affairs in order, for you will return victorious... or you won't return at all."
3399,"Seeds of the Lashers : We need more weapons in the fight against the Scourge. The natural properties of the Emerald Dragonshrine to the southeast may be the answer.Any unliving creature, save those that Sylvanas has redeemed, that steps foot in the dragonshrine falls to dust.I want to test a theory, and I want you to be my instrument in doing so, young <race>. Go to the Emerald Dragonshrine and take the seeds from the emerald lashers therein."
3400,"Local Support : We've reached a deadlock with the Horde in Grizzly Hills.  Our forces are just about evenly matched and all signs so far have pointed to a stalemate.Until this morning, that is.  The local trappers have requested our help.  Apparently the Horde took something that belongs to them... a relic of some sort.We get this back for them and they'll give us the edge we need.  Head to the Evergreen Trading Post, west of Conquest Hold and look for a cedar chest."
3401,"Time Yet Remains : I feel refreshed... renewed... but the plague still grips me. Not to worry, I am still eternally grateful that you went to such lengths for me, a complete stranger. If nothing else, you've bought me a few more precious hours not plaguing the world as a hideous undead.Thank you, <class>. Please extend my thanks to Tirion as well, and let him know that it has been an honor to serve beside him."
3402,"The Grand Melee : The grand melee is the most important of the tournament's competitions. The people of the Exodar are looking forward to seeing us win the melee. To that end, they've been honing their skills against the valiants representing the other Alliance capitals.I suggest you do the same.Go to the stables outside the pavilion, equip your lance, mount the stabled Azuremyst elekk, and challenge the valiants. They wait in the Alliance Valiants' Ring just outside our tent."
3403,"The Spire of Blood : As you inspect the captured blood vial, you realize its contents are still warm. The victim must have just been bled and may still be alive.What use would the Scourge have for blood? They've never shown an interest in live prisoners in the past. Perhaps if you can locate the source of the blood, you'll be able to discover what the Scourge is planning."
3404,"Enlistment Day : You've come to enlist, right?  Normally you'd have to stand in line like the other recruits.  Normally you'd be out of luck because the recruitment ledger's gone missing and I can't process anyone until the new books get here.Fortunately for you, <name>, I've heard about you and what you did in Outland.  To be honest, you're a cut above these poor saps.  Lines aren't for you.Go to the barracks and speak to General Arlos.  He'll be more than happy to meet with someone of your caliber."
3405,"Blackriver Brawl : The Venture Company abandoned operations shortly after we showed up.  Clearly they were afraid of what we were going to do to their greedy little hides.With them gone, their logging camps are up for grabs.  Our war machine is a hungry beast... without renewing our supplies we won't make it to Icecrown.Unfortunately the Alliance seems to have the same idea and we must make sure we're the ones that prevail.  Head into the logging camp and help us fight the Alliance scum."
3406,The Doctor and the Lich-Lord : There are two... that must... be killed.The doctor and... the lich-lord... are above. Find them... destroy them... before.......it is too... late....
3407,The Wasp Hunter's Apprentice : Rakjak not dumb. Maybe you good at killing things. Maybe Frenzyheart can make you into real hunter.Dajik hunts giant wasp things better than all wolvar. Go with Dajik to Sapphire Hive to southeast or to river in south and learn the hunt.
3408,"Meet Number Two : All the good work you've done for us hasn't gone unnoticed, <name>.  Our second in command, the delightful Annie Bonn, is incredibly impressed with what you've done so far and wants to meet you."
3409,"The Runic Prophecies : Brann's journal also contained a guide to iron dwarf symbols. I've inscribed these on a keystone which will help you to understand the words inscribed on the rune plates.From the journal entries, it seems Brann may be chasing after clues to the origins of his people. Keep your eyes open for any clues as to his destination.Return to Thor Modan, northeast of here, stand before each of the plates, and use the stone to determine the contents of each. We can't allow the Alliance to find him first."
3410,"The Plume of Alystros : I can feel that the shrine is not completely back in balance. The verdant keeper has been angered by our actions, and I sense that he will not listen to reason.Alystros is an immense skytalon who perches at the south end of the Emerald Dragonshrine. It is he who is in charge of the dragonshrine's aerial defenses. I fear that we will have to deal with him.Take these skytalon molts and place them on the ground where he can see them. He will come. Bring me his plume."
3411,"The Boon of Alexstrasza : You must understand, young <race>, that cleansing the body in favor of life anew is something well within my grasp... removing the plague of undeath without affecting the body, however, is beyond the scope of the powers that I control.If this Bridenbrad is the beacon of light that you profess him to be, perhaps he will endure such a cleansing and thrive, but I cannot state with confidence that this is the salvation that you seek. Take it and go with all of my blessings."
3412,"Necro Overlord Mezhen : The Scourge are at Gjalerbron and they have necromancers with them! They must be working to bring the vrykul into Arthas' fold.I want the leader of these necrolords eliminated!Do whatever it takes, <name>, but see to it that Necro Overlord Mezhen, and whatever he's attempting to accomplish, is neutralized.I will not see the vrykul successfully allied with the Scourge!Look for Mezhen on the platform in the rear right section of Gjalerbron."
3413,"Death From Above : We're doing a good job of holding the front lines against these bugs.  Some of these cheeky fiends, however, can fly over the aforementioned front lines and are really beating down on our inner defenses.I've requisitioned reinforced fishing nets from our civilian ships.  If you've got a good enough throwing arm, they'll help you knock the enemy out of the sky.  Thin their numbers so that our defenses can hold the keep."
3414,"The Walking Dead : Your assistance to us has been tremendous, <name>, but there is something that is troubling me: these so-called Scourge.The spirits of the land and air, the waters and the fire below the world, would not abide their presence, but seem to do nothing about them. We will see to it that they are dealt with!Perhaps it is asking too much, but I would have you return west to Gjalerbron and destroy the unnatural Scourge in that vile lair. Be sure to check in the Waking Halls below Gjalerbron as well!"
3415,"Mimicking Nature's Call : The horn has been roughed out, but before I make the traditional carvings, I want to be certain that it will work. Ahota tells me that he tests his horns at the foot of the frozen waterfall to the northeast of the post. Ahota tells me that our hunters have used the acoustics of frozen water in this way for generations. I can't wait to learn more!Will you help me test out the horn? If I've done everything right, you may even attract a yeti, so be prepared! Bring the horn back once you've tested it."
3416,The Activation Rune : This colossal being appears to be inactive.  You notice an empty rune-shaped slot on its chest.Perhaps you might be able to find the missing rune inside the nearby overlook.
3417,"Dead Man's Debt : You might've heard of Black Conrad, he's a famous pirate around these parts.Well, he had a thing for gambling on my fights.  He had a thing for not paying, too.I'd love to collect, but trouble is... he's dead.I was about ready to write the whole thing off, when I came across this...<Taruk unfolds a map of the Isle of Spears with an X on a northeastern plateau.>He hid his treasure on tuskarr land.  I want you to get it.  I'll be damned if I let that bilge sucker get away without paying."
3418,"Securing the Bait : We're not likely to get Broodmother Slivina's attention waving our arms around like fools, but if we're smart, we can bait her into fighting us. We'll also secure more, uh, fodder for my little project.<Dorian glances over at Zootfizzle.>But don't worry about that for now. Just look for the primordial drake eggs in the area east and northeast of the camp. Burst them open and scoop up the hatchlings that come out. When the broodmother realizes what we've done, she'll have no choice but to face us."
3419,"Boiling Point : Ah, it is information that you crave: the whereabouts and condition of your 'farseer'. He did not see so far as to avoid the trouble which befell him.Nevertheless, I will give you the means to acquire the knowledge. But first, you will do some things for me.No doubt you have seen the war between fire and water to the south. Simmer keeps boiling Churn's pool, and the two have been battling for ages.Go to the Charred Rise and Blistering Pool, and convince each of them to stop their bickering."
3420,"Rescuing Evanor : At last, we attack!Once we've cleared the platform I'll use the key.You are to ensure that Lady Evanor remains safe after her release.Hurry now, let us be off!"
3421,"Not-So-Honorable Combat : Atop the tallest peak to the southwest overlooking Jotunheim is Battlescar Spire. It is a place of reverence for the vrykul, second only to Valhalas in terms of where they prefer to do honorable combat.We shall visit not-so-honorable combat upon it.Gather your companions and fly to the spire. When you are ready, light the signal fire and I will appear within the body of Iskalder.We will fight, you will win, and Vardmadra is sure to come to witness the battle!"
3422,"A Time for Heroes : It's good to have you among us, <name>.  We've all heard of your past deeds.As you know, King Wrynn is moving great armies into Northrend to meet those of Arthas.  But armies are nothing without true heroes to inspire and lead them.I want you to be that hero for my men.  Fight alongside them against the Scourge that lays siege to our stronghold.Report to Sergeant Hammerhill outside the inner hold.  Valiance Keep cannot fall.  The future of our campaign depends on it."
3423,"Traversing the Rift : I've been mindful of your efforts, mortal. Do not feign surprise. Surely you've felt my eye upon you.The time has come to peel back a layer of darkness from your mind. There are stark truths that you have grown ready to accept.Before hearing the tale, you shall be shown firsthand what we face.Put your affairs in order, <class>...."
3424,"Kaw the Mammoth Destroyer : You cannot defeat the being responsible for the slaughter of my kind by yourself. The mammoths of the tundra will help you!Venture forth to the plains and find a mammoth bull. He will allow you to mount him and control his movements and actions. Ride upon his back and find Kaw, north of here at Kaw's Roost. Together, you will be the instrument of Kaw's demise.Destroy Kaw's armies and take from Kaw his coveted war halberd. Return to Lathorius at the D.E.H.T.A. Encampment should you succeed."

You help me get out of these chains and I'll help you find your little green friend.The Hyldnir who runs this mine is known as Mildred the Cruel -- and with good reason.Tell her you've been sent to lend a hand with the mines.  Do whatever she asks until she trusts you with the keys to my shackles."
3426,
3427,"Karuk's Oath : They call themselves the Kvaldir.  My people have legends about them; we call them the tuk-hariq - walkers of the fog.My village was destroyed by these giant mist-men.  Everyone I knew was slain, including my father Ariut.By tuskarr law I must seek retribution against those who shed my kin's blood.I am but a fisherman and I've not yet passed the test of manhood... I cannot stand toe-to-toe with the vile Kvaldir.If you were to carry out my blood duty for me, I will be in great debt to you."
3428,"The Fate Of The Fallen : The Argent Crusade is hardly the first force to challenge the Lich King. Our enemy turns spirits of the fallen against us.Their spirits wander the Valley of Fallen Heroes, southwest of the grounds and between Aldur'thar and the Ironwall Rampart. The area is littered with discarded soul crystals, used by the Scourge to control the spirits. Gather those soul crystals and use them with this Light-blessed relic to bestow the blessing of peace upon the spirits. They have more than earned their rest."
3429,"Khu'nok Will Know : Although you have acted valiantly in freeing the trapped calves, many of them will still die. You see, without a caretaker, these calves must fend for themselves in the wild.But there is a way! Hope yet remains!North of here in the mammoth fields, bordering the Scalding Pools, you will find Khu'nok the Behemoth: a mammoth as wise as he is ancient. Take this mammoth orphan and present it to Khu'nok. He will know what to do."
3430,Bitter Departure : Oi - thank you! I thought for sure I'd just be a spider snack. Perhaps I'm speaking a bit soon though - let's get the heck out of here!Let me know as soon as you're ready to go... make it quick.
3431,"The Hyldsmeet : Whether you've noticed or not, by defeating your first Hyldnir in hand-to-hand combat, you've entered the Hyldsmeet -- the great competition of Hyldnir against Hyldnir to determine who will rule by Thorim's side.The Hyldsmeet is the reason why I was imprisoned, for I sought to partake in the competition but was far too old and frail to be a match for the Hyldnir.If you're willing to listen, I've a proposal for you."
3432,"The Liquid Fire of Elune : <race> will you assist me?The Scourge have moved into Icemist to the north. Wherever they go, they spread their taint, and the creatures of the land suffer.Take this vial, which is filled with the liquid fire of Elune from the moonwell. Please, use the liquid to cleanse the corpses of the blighted wildlife that you find."
3433,"Valduran the Stormborn : We have no choice, <name>. What you learned in Mimir's Workshop means that we must act before Valduran can complete and unleash his new weapon.Even now, the refuge's defenders fight to buy us time to deal with Valduran the Stormborn.You must go to Nidavelir, across the Snowdrift Plains to the southwest, and then find and face Valduran. But you will not be alone. Bring this war horn with you and sound it as you prepare to face the leader of our enemies. Bruor and I will aid you in this battle."
3434,"The Stories Dead Men Tell : The crystal will reveal the truth about how three of the tournament's combatants died. Take it with you to the graveyard east of the Tournament Grounds and use it before the graves of Sir Wendell Balfour, Lorien Sunblaze, and Conall Irongrip.If indeed these men were murdered, then we must find a way to tie it to the Black Knight before he strikes again. Look closely at what the crystal tells you, <name>, for we must be certain these deaths were not accidental."
3435,"Winterfin Commerce : Now that you can speak with the Winterfin, it is time for you to let them get to know you. One of the best ways to do that is to conduct business with them.The murlocs prize clams over any other object and their only surviving merchant is Ahlurglgr. If I were you, I'd collect a handful of Winterfin clams and give them to him as a gift.The clams can be found all over down in the trench, as well as across it in the Winterfin village and their caverns."
3436,"Mikhail's Journal : From what you can gather, this journal was written by a denizen of Silverbrook named Mikhail.It is written in some variant of the common human tongue.  Perhaps you should bring this back to Conqueror Krenna."
3437,"A Voice in the Dark : The object is not a crystal at all, but some form of organ, encased in ice.As you touch it, your hand reels in horrible pain.  You feel as if your hand has been cut, yet there is no visible wound.As you collect your thoughts, you hear a young boy's voice nearby.""You really shouldn't have done that."""
3438,"You Reap What You Sow : This is what it has come down to... revenge.<Har'koa sighs.>Take this ritual kit and enact it near Quetz'lun's corpse upon her altar. If everything works properly, her spirit should be drawn into the material world where she will be able to reclaim her power from the prophet.The rest will be up to you, <name>. You must slay the prophet in his drained state."
3439,"Poke and Prod : While your commander has his focus diluted by his loathing of your Alliance rivals, you can depend on me to direct my attention squarely on the real enemy here - the Lich King and his minions.In order to hold any hope of conquering him at the citadel, your people must take and hold each gate.For now, let us focus on the first. Return to the front and prod their defenses. Look for any sign of weakness that we might exploit.I'll await your report, <class>."
3440,"The Missing Bronzebeard : Before we left, I received the file Scout Vor'takh compiled on this Brann Bronzebeard. There can be no doubt that Brann was headed for the Storm Peaks from his journal entries and findings in Grizzly Hills. Before we crashed, I caught sight of a campsite south of here, across the Foot Steppes, and overlooking the frozen Bor's Breath River.If Brann isn't there, search the camp and its environs for any clues as to where that blasted dwarf might've gone. Bring back anything you find."
3441,"Containing the Rot : With Scourge comes death and disease. We often overlook that the wildlife of a Scourge infested area is ravaged and ultimately destroyed by rot and contagion.For most of the indigenous beasts of the Dragonblight it is too late. The festering disease that the Scourge brings has already infected the beasts and they are now rabid and rotting.You must venture west, towards the Pit of Narjun, and cull the infected wildlife. Check their corpses for a preserved organ as we need one to devise a vaccine."
3442,"Softening the Blow : Our best bet for moving our forces quickly to Icecrown Glacier lies with the network of tunnels beneath the ancient iron dwarf city of Thor Modan.Brugar Stoneshear and his Explorers' League boys aren't going to be happy, but orders are orders.The news might go over better if you brought him a cask of that moonshine sold by that trapper, Hugh Glass, down at Redwood Trading Post, southeast of here along the tree line.Man's not right in the head, but you won't find better moonshine out here."
3443,"Thassarian, My Brother : I recently received word from William Allerton, a family friend, that my brother enlisted here in Valiance Keep on the same day he did.  Thing is... my brother's been dead for years.I sold everything I owned to come looking for Thassarian, only to be stonewalled by the local bureaucracy.  I've even been threatened with arrest if I keep snooping around.I need someone in the good graces of the higher-ups... someone like you.  If you can help me, I heard that William's stationed at the Farshire mine."
3444,"Shadow Vault Decree : Thane Ufrang the Mighty sits within his hall overlooking the Savage Ledge. I've studied him. The thane is a patient vrykul, with a head for strategy and warfare. He's also shown a penchant for biding his time and not wanting to overplay his hand in the ongoing battle.I need him dead!I've written a decree. Stand before the thane and read it aloud.<The duke arches his eyebrow in amusement.>It should... unnerve him at the least."
3445,"Lefty Loosey, Righty Tighty : Okay, I think we're ready for the penultimate assault... before you can bring down Mechazod, you're going to have to dismantle his lieutenants first!You'll find Twonky, ED-210, Max Blasto, and The Grinder at the West Point, North Point, Mid Point and South Point stations, respectively.To get them to show up, just turn the valves at the stations to mess up whatever they're trying to do out there. You can't miss the places, they all have spinning lights."
3446,Flown the Coop! : Dumb Goregek stumble into chicken house and let all the chickens go!They all around hill - go get chickens back!<Elder Harkek shoos you away.>
3447,"Give it a Name : My, my, how long has it been? How long have we been working on this damned plague? Finally, after an eternity of failure, we are blessed with perfection. This... It doesn't even have a proper name yet! This blight... That's it, BLIGHT! This blight will tear down the very fabric of life!<Harris hands you a vial.>Now, find the bat handler, Tobias, and show him the specimen. He'll get you on your way to Venomspite."
3448,"Mage-Lieutenant Malister : THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS! Those proto-drakes are attacking the keep!Beasts such as that should have been scared off when you took care of their clutches and whelps.You did take care of them, right?<name>, this calls for more direct action. Speak with my advisor, Mage-Lieutenant Malister. He'll provide you with the means to get at those infernal creatures."
3449,"Plug the Sinkholes : The Scourge are showing no sign of letting up, <name>.  It's those blasted sinkholes; they connect to tunnels all the way to Icecrown for all we know.  Giant undead worms burrow under the ground to create them.If there's something years of mining has taught me it's that without support beams, tunnels will cave in easily after an explosion.Take these explosives and place them at the entrance to the sinkholes up on the ridge beyond the beach to the west.  Come back after you've collapsed them."
3450,"End Arcanimus : There is one last thing that I would have you do, <name> the <race>. I would have you destroy Arcanimus!The sorcerers to the west used that giant device in the sky to bore a massive pit into our resting place. When they did that, they unleashed a monstrosity!I would not care if it were only a concern for mortals, but Arcanimus feeds upon the spirits of the dead.You will put an end to it now!"
3451,"Power of the Great Ones : We need to do something to stop puppy-men attacking Sparktouched Haven. Jaloot brought me very special crystal that he found in River's Heart... we seen only one like it before.The crystal not have power now, but the opened up lifeblood pillar should have energy to recharge it if you just bring it close. Once the crystal is charged, go to Sparktouched Haven in far southwest and let the crystal's energy make you big and strong.Then it time to kick some puppy-men butt."
3452,Picking Up the Pieces : Much was lost when Korthia was pulled into the Maw.  Priceless relics were torn asunder. I have seen creatures carrying the remnants of these items.   They must be recovered.  Confront the Jailer's forces and search what remains of Korthia for these fragments of our once glorious vault.
3453,"The Cleansing Of Jintha'kalar : We wrested this ancient Drakkari temple from a swarm of invading Scourge. Not more than one-hundred paces from where we stand is the ruined city of Jintha'kalar. Scourge necromancers run amok, turning the living Drakkari trolls that remain into servants of the Lich King.All are now lost to the Light. All must be purged.<Valus looks upon you sternly.>All."
3454,"The Collapse : I have created and bound Alluvius using the Horn of Elemental Fury. He will respond to the horn's call when you stand near the southernmost sinkhole in the Geyser Fields.The quake Alluvius will unleash should collapse the Nerubian tunnels and put an end to their flanking attack. I wouldn't be surprised if the Nerubian commander showed himself after the quake. If the collapse of the tunnels doesn't break the back of their assault, the defeat of their leader surely will."
3455,"Weakness to Lightning : You now have the power of the storm within you. I will give you the means to focus that power and weaken the robots in the pools.Take this lightning rod. Use it against the robotic creations of the mechagnomes you find within the greater pools area to the west. Do not worry about using it against the mechagnomes themselves; Greatmother Taiga has other plans for them.Once the robots are weakened by the power of the storm, dismantle them utterly!"
3456,"Reading the Meters : I had hoped that the Nexus' impact was limited to this region. Recently though, reports have flooded in from all over Azeroth suggesting that geologic instability is growing exponentially!I need the Nexus monitored regularly as I work to develop a solution.I've placed sensitive instruments around Coldarra, disguised as Malygos' scrying orbs. One lies in the trench near the Nexus, and three are hidden in the structures around the valley's perimeter. Visit each and return to me with their readings."
3457,"Destroy the Forges! : In my folly, I'd thought Valduran's project at Narvir's Cradle, a large construction area to the south, no more than a grotesque monument to ""Keeper"" Loken's cruelty.Now we know the truth, that it was meant to be used as a weapon against us and our allies. We must not allow this iron colossus to reach completion, <name>, for it will mean the end of the refuge.Go to Narvir's Cradle, find the lightning forges the stormforged artisans use, and sabotage them."
3458,"Rejek: First Blood : Rejek just became youngest warrior in all of Frenzyheart tribe. Father gave Rejek a mighty sword to defeat Frenzyheart enemies, but old tradition say sword need to be blooded first. Older warrior usually do that. You do this honor for Rejek?Take blade, put in corpses of all Frenzyheart foes: wasps and hardknuckles to southwest, and the big-tongues. Maybe blood blade on Mistwhispers, far to northwest near Bittertide Lake."
3459,
3460,"Deathspeaker Kharos : The Cult of the Damned has redoubled its efforts to see us destroyed. They have grown bold and are massing their strength at Deathspeaker's Watch on the ridge west of the tournament grounds.The ruthless Deathspeaker Kharos has his men fortifying their positions, preparing to unleash all of the cult's weapons.My men are preparing themselves and the valiants to defend the grounds, but I want champions like you, <name>, to lead our efforts to blunt the attack. Find Deathspeaker Kharos and slay him."
3461,"Rivenwood Captives : Something, most likely the walking dead known as the Scourge, has agitated the creatures hereabouts.While escorting the sage here, we lost most of our hunting force to the riven widows -- huge and deadly spiders, which inhabit the Rivenwood to the north.I must stay here to protect the small force we have left, but you... you could see if my longrunners are still alive, trapped within the riven widow's cocoons.Would you do this, stranger?"
3462,"Pest Control : Oi, mon! One of dose little snobold runts trashed our camp during da last dragon attack. Dey've been houndin us wheneva we turn our backs and I've had enough. To da east you'll find da snobolds hiding under da skirts of some of da local magnataur. Go slaughter dem. If da magnataur interfere on behalf of deir slaves, kill dem as well."
3463,"A Colossal Threat : You've done an excellent job of delaying the work on the iron colossus, but I fear we've only made the stormforged more determined to complete the weapon.Even now, they're bringing in new laborers and the overseers push them to the limit. We may not be able to keep them from bringing the colossus online, after all. Return to Narvir's Cradle, to the south and find the documents detailing the colossus' offensive and defensive abilities. They should be near the tents and forges on the bottom level."
3464,"Keep Them at Bay : This wretched Westfall Brigade is proving a tougher opponent than we'd thought. Though few in number, they fight well and bravely, but we cannot afford to wait them out.Conqueror Krenna's orders were to capture the port quickly. You must break the stalemate, <name>. Find the enemy's marines and slaughter them until the resistance ceases. Only then will we be able to claim ownership of the port.Go quickly. We don't want to keep Conqueror Krenna waiting."
3465,"Bring 'Em Back Alive : Take this riding snaffle, <name>. You'll notice that I've placed a tiny medicine dispenser in the mouthpiece. That thing will cure the infection as soon as a kodo bites down. Once you've cured the sick out of 'em, you'll need to ride 'em home. They'll be weak so you'll need to gently direct 'em here.Bring my babies back, <name>!One last thing, you've got ten minutes! That's how long the antidote will remain effective inside that snaffle."
3466,"Crusader Forward Camp : Crusader Dargath, Crusader MacKellar, Engineer Reed and the twins, Gerk and Burr, were sent to the Dead Fields to establish a battle front days ago. As of my last correspondence with them, they had successfully established a camp on the border of the Dead Fields, northwest of here.In light of this newfound information about Drakuru and Prince Navarius I think it would be prudent to send someone to the Crusader Forward Camp post-haste.Pack up your belongings, <name>. You must leave at once!"
3467,"Search Indu'le Village : I'm certain that you'll find the next ley line focus somewhere in the remains of Indu'le Village to the southeast. The problem is, we've had absolutely no reports of there being one there.If you would, please investigate the village for any signs of the focus or the mage hunters and their commander in the area.Don't forget to search in the lake if you have to."
3468,"Trident of the Son : <From the scratches he makes in the rock, you see several symbols: a trident, a mur'ghoul, the sun, a wrecked ship, and a rough stick-figure of yourself.><Puzzling out what the murloc is conveying takes a while. Obviously he wants you to get a trident from the Chillmere Coast, but the image of the sun is puzzling. That is until you realize he means his son.><His son was changed into a mur'ghoul! He wants you to find him to the south near the wrecked ship and return with his trident.>"
3469,"Naxxramas and the Fall of Wintergarde : Lord Fordragon has led a crushing assault against Arthas at the Wrathgate. In response to this affront, Arthas has sent Naxxramas down upon us. While Kel'Thuzad hides in the floating citadel, his ground commander, Thel'zan, lays siege to Wintergarde Keep. The lower village is already lost and any chance of extracting survivors from the ruins diminishes by the minute.We must act quickly! Report to Gryphon Commander Urik at the gryphon station at once! He'll get you up to speed.Leave me!"
3470,"Throwing Down : Clever...Just when it seemed we were getting things under control, they tunneled right underneath us and secured the shrine!Now we're caught between two Nerubian armies and our predicament is worsening by the minute.As our first course of action, we must stop them from reinforcing. Their tunnels must be sealed.Take these grenades and throw them down their craters to the northwest."
3471,"Informing the Queen : <The dragon steward pulls your letter of introduction out of his sleeve.>Yes... yes, I think that you are ready to see the queen now.When you are ready, speak to me again and I will see to it that one of these drakes delivers you safely to the top of the temple. You will need to present your letter in person to Queen Alexstrasza."
3472,"High Commander Halford Wyrmbane : <Palena hands the missive back to you.>Snowstorm will take you to Wintergarde, <name>. I guarantee you that it will be the fastest flight you've ever taken. Go now!"
3473,"Uncovering the Tunnels : The first place we'll search for entrances to the Thor Modan tunnel system will be the outlying buildings.As I left the site with my men, it looked like the iron dwarf defenders were taking refuge inside the buildings. Be careful as you explore them.Any tunnel entrances are likely to be toward the back of the buildings. I'm not sure what Stoutmantle thinks we're going to find down there, but I doubt the iron dwarves will make the search easy."
3474,"A Disturbance In The West : Another force threatens to destroy all that we have worked for, <name>. You must head westward to Stars' Rest. Archmage Modera has sensed a great disturbance in the magical ley lines of our world that must be dealt with immediately!Go now, <name>! Speak to Rodney Wells at the gryphon station here in Wintergarde and let him know the nature of your mission. He will place you on his fastest gryphon to deliver you to Stars' Rest. Speak with Archmage Modera when you arrive."
3475,"A Diplomatic Mission : I see that you are very eager to help, <name>.  You didn't come all the way to Northrend to stay holed up in a city!  I've just the task for you... something that'll take you far away from here.We've long sought to gain the favor of the tuskarr native to Northrend.  Recently a young tuskarr came to us seeking help, something we couldn't offer at the time.Now that you're around, maybe you can lend him a hand.  Look for Karuk near the Riplash Strand, southwest of here, and see what you can do to help."
3476,"Drop It then Rock It! : I'm not about to put the fate of this mission into the hands of some untested scrub.Now, if you want to prove to me that you've got what it takes to carry out this mission, you'll need to do what I tell you.Take this battle standard and head over to Baleheim, directly north of here. Once you're at Baleheim, find the center of town and drop our flag. Fight off any vrykul dirt bags that attempt to take down our beloved flag and return to me once you've established Alliance dominance!"
3477,"Avenge Iskaal : The totem of Issliruk is ready, <name>, and for that I thank you.  We must cast our peaceful ways for the time being and strike at those who've attacked our land and our kin.The pirate slavers that raided Iskaal have lost their minds and slaughtered all their captives.  Go to Iskaal, to the east of here and do what must must be done.  Take this horn and call on my brethren should you need assistance."
3478,"A Traitor Among Us : Our second in command, Annie Bonn, has been acting rather paranoid as of late.  She seems sure we have an infiltrator in our ranks, can ye believe it?Anyhow, we have a foolproof way of uncovering rats around these parts.  See, good ole' Zeh'gehn over here happens to be an authentic witch doctor.  His family hails all the way from Zul... something or other.Go let him know that we're in need of his divination skills.  I must warn ye, <name>, only one or two of us can understand anything Zeh'gehn says."
3479,"Lakeside Landing : When the trouble with the Venture Company started, I asked Marvin Wobblesprocket and his wife, Tamara, to take their flying machines east to River's Heart. I asked them to setup a small camp there so that we could use them as a relay to fly in supplies and survey the area.They should have arrived by now and started setting up. River's Heart is near the center of the basin where the rivers converge. Search for Lakeshore Landing on the northeast shore. Marvin mentioned it would be the best spot."
3480,"The Chain Gun And You : We've set up chain guns and barricades directly to the east and to the west. Our injured soldiers are hiding in both rooms - trying their best to not alert the mindless ghouls to their presence.Now that we have ammo, I need you to man one of the chain guns and use it to blast a path clear for our soldiers! Once you're on board, call a soldier out from hiding and then lay down heavy fire to keep the Scourge off him!Get a move on!"
3481,"Blackwatch : The Scourge has a large facility called the Fleshwerks, dedicated to producing abominations and flesh giants. If we can shut it down, we can deprive the Lich King of a large component of his armies.I've sent Darkrider Arly to the area. She has a small base, Blackwatch, on a ridge overlooking the Fleshwerks and to the west of Corp'rethar. I'm told the Argent Crusade is sending someone to coordinate their efforts there, but the darkrider will know what to do. Find and assist her."
3482,"Trolls Is Gone Crazy! : Drakuru... You know who this troll is? I think bad troll are controlled by the Drakuru troll. They call themself Drakuru trolls - that how I know. Now you see why I am chief of Rageclaw. Smartest of all wolvar!But that not why I talk to you now. Bad troll come and kick Rageclaw out of den. Rageclaw that no run away held as prisoner in village. You go to Rageclaw Den, southeast, and free captured Rageclaw. Kill troll for lock opener. You maybe kill many troll for many lock opener."

Once he is freed, assist him in destroying the Anub'ar leader, Under-king Anub'et'kan. When the Under-king is defeated, take from his chitinous carapace a fragment as a trophy to present to the Horde at Agmar's Hammer. Let Agmar see the might of the High Chief!"

Zeh'gehn has... many different special ways of talking... all mixed together.From what I can tell he wants a frog and a knife.""Silvermoon"" Harry might have a knife on the cheap.  There's frogs all over town, just grab one and bring it to him along with the knife.I'd hate to be in the poor critter's shoes, if you know what I mean."
3486,"The Forgotten Tale : The toxins in the murkweed elixir will render you unconscious. So powerful is the effect of the murkweed that even your spirit will be fooled, allowing you to temporarily enter the world of the dead.Once a spirit, you must speak to the ghostly denizens of the Forgotten Shore. Seek out the cause of their anguish and return to me.Remember, <name>, these spirits were once Alliance soldiers. Treat them with respect, honor and dignity.Now, with elixir in hand, venture south to the Forgotten Shore."
3487,"A Righteous Sermon : Godfrey Goodard, once a righteous man and mayor of Wintergarde, is now an agent of the Scourge. His transformation from man to undying ghoul has taken place slowly, over time. He hears the call of the Lich King now and lives only to serve his master.But as with all Scourge, Godfrey knows the language of death and with proper motivation, will tell us what we need to know about the tome.Once you hear what you need to hear, return to the High Commander at the front lines. I'll clean up here as needed."
3488,"No Fly Zone : Now that you got your bone gryphon, I wantcha to take it back down there everyday and make a no fly zone over Onslaught Harbor.I gotta admit, mon, I don't really care if you use the bone gryphon to kill them gryphon riders or not. But I'm guessin' that if you do, you'll find it much easier to get to 'em.Besides, it's got lots of neat tricks you can use."
3489,"Chasing Icestorm: Thel'zan's Phylactery : Your frostwyrm is out there.<Tyralion points west.>And it's a big one!When you're ready to fight, go speak with ""Wyrmbait."" He'll ""fetch"" her. Once Icestorm is close enough we'll chain her to the ground and finish her off! Hopefully, with your help, we'll be able to take her down and get you that phylactery.Once you've got the phylactery, return to Wintergarde Keep and report to High Commander Halford Wyrmbane. He's been making preparations for the final showdown with Thel'zan."
3490,"Emergency Protocol: Section 8.2, Paragraph D : There's only one more thing left to do before I can finally return to the airstrip and make my report. Section 8.2, paragraph D of the emergency protocol requires me to scuttle as much of the wreckage as possible, in order to prevent our technology from falling into enemy hands.I'll give you my torch if you agree to help me complete this last duty. I don't want to think about what the Horde's goblin allies will do if these machines fall into their hands."
3491,"Foundation for Revenge : I have something special planned for my favorite high priests. But first you get to prove yourself in laying the foundation for my revenge.You do still want to live, yes?As you have seen, my devotees are enjoying their stay here, but now it's time for them to make final restitution.Do me the smallest of favors if you would, <name>. Lure them near my soul fonts and then put an end to their existences.They taste so delicious, and their sacrifice will not go in vain, I can assure you."
3492,"Wooly Justice : Ahunae hear about your trip to Mam'toth Crater, mon. The children of Mam'toth are enraged and cry out for justice!Follow the avenue northeast up the steps to the next tier of Zul'Drak. On your right you will find what's left of the Altar of Mam'toth.When you get there, flash this Medallion of Mam'toth in front of the eyes of one of the enraged mammoths. It'll calm down for a little while, letting you hop on its back.Ride it around, trampling all of the Mam'toth disciples that you can find!"
3493,"Suppressing the Elements : If you are to survive here, as we have, you must learn to face the environment's challenges head on. The elements will claim your life if you're not vigilant, as the proliferation of elementals in these northern hills shows.We must cull the elementals one last time before we can leave this place. Are you willing to aid us while we continue to make preparations?You must kill any iceshard elementals or howling cyclones you encounter in the snowy hills surrounding the outpost."
3494,"Expression of Gratitude : I know just the job for an eager newcomer! We've got a gnoll problem. You might even call it a gnoll infestation! Pesky things. They keep creeping up more and more, and now they're on our doorstep, stealing our parts! Inconceivable.It all begins and ends with their uppity leader, Gnarlhide. I want you to see to that ""ends"" part. Go pay him a visit at his camp all the way to the west, in Snowblind Hills.And when I say ""pay him a visit,"" that's a euphemism for ""kill him painfully."" Kay? Kay!"
3495,"Strength of Icemist : <Greatmother Icemist bows.>It is an honor to meet you, hero. It is because of your actions that many of us are here now, alive and ready for battle against the Scourge.You have done so much for us that it shames me to ask you for your assistance once more. Despite my pleas, my only son, Banthok, left here to go in search of his father, High Chief Icemist. He was last seen heading west, towards Icemist Village. Please find Banthok. I do not know what I would do if I lost my son."
3496,"Eyes of the Eagle : Garwal hides himself behind an unnatural magic. None can see him unless he wants you to. There may be one chance we can take, though.My enemy, the great eagle, Talonshrike, is said to have eyes that can see anything. If you were to take her eyes, then you would surely be able to see Garwal.Talonshrike keeps her nest at the base of a waterfall just to the southwest of the vrykul place called Skorn. If you touch the eggs in her nest, she will come down from the sky to kill you.Get her eyes."
3497,"Make the Bad Snake Go Away : We were here long before the puppy-men came. This is very sacred place - we will not leave.You seem like maybe you good, but we have Lafoo stay with you just in case. You understand we think.There snakes thing that keeps trying to eat our hatchlings. Go with Lafoo and make them stop, okay? Especially big one near waterfall to northeast."
3498,"... Or Maybe We Don't : The golem's cells have just enough power to run it at the lowest levels, but it can't power any of its combat systems.The good news is that the perimeter of Dun Argol is patrolled by lightning sentries. We should be able to use their power to charge up the golem's weapon systems.Bring the golem with you, take it close to them, it will absorb the power as the sentries die."
3499,"Honor Challenge : The first step we're going to take is at a place in Jotunheim called the Savage Ledge. It's just over the mountains to the west.On the ledge the vrykul warriors are always sparring, being instructed in the finer arts of battle by their thane's men.I want you to take this flag and issue a challenge to a number of them. Let's demoralize them with the 'mere' skills of a <race>, shall we?<The duke grins, his rotting teeth flashing in the dim light of the vault.>"
3500,"Leave Our Mark : We must attack the vrykul of Jotunheim on many levels. Brute force, of course, is good, but I prefer a more cerebral approach.I want you to demoralize them.My men here have forged a number of banners for you. I would like for you to take and plant them near the corpses of fallen vrykul.Let the banners serve as a constant reminder to them that they face a more immediate threat than the wrath of the Lich King."
3501,"The Culler Cometh : Near the southern end of this bluff is where you will find the treacherous leader of the caribou trappers. She is a savage like no other, making a mockery out of the carcasses of the slain animals: drinking from their blood and howling to the moons!Find this murderer, Karen, and end her worthless existence.Prepare yourself properly, <name>. Karen the Culler has indulged in the riches that Nesingwary has lavished upon her!"
3502,"The Nefarious Clam Master... : It's despicable, really, to anoint one's self as the ""Clam Master,"" as if they hold mastery over the creatures of the sea. None may make such claims!This ""Clam Master"" must be found and slain. He was last seen at the wreckage just off the coast of the Abandoned Reach. Find him and kill him.Once this is done, return to Hierophant Cenius at the D.E.H.T.A. Encampment, north of here, and let her know that the mission was a success."
3503,"On Brann's Trail : After the discovery of Brann's journal in Grizzly Hills, we've only had one other communication from Brann. A mysterious note found its way to Explorers' League headquarters in Ironforge, with no indication of where it came from. All it said was that we're to meet Brann at his camp and help him with his search.From what I can tell, the camp should be located northeast of here, across the Bor's Breath River and at the foot of some ruins from the Path of the Titans."
3504,"Rhino Mastery: The Chase : Well, that's settled then. We'll seek out this native sage and have a word with him. He's not likely to volunteer his services, though.I'm told he keeps a small lean-to near the Bones of Nozronn, just across the river to the south. Seek him out, introduce yourself, and ask what he requires to help us track down this patriarch of the rhinos."
3505,"A Monument to the Fallen : Bring these fragments to Njormeld. He will use the pieces of that sacred relic in the construction of a mighty monument.May it soothe the pains and heal the scars my people have borne these many years.May its presence help to bring about a new age that sees us once again in glorious battle at Thorim's side.Go now, <class>. Njormeld awaits you."
3506,"The Gearmaster : Gearmaster Mechazod is insane! He says that he offers us immortality by removing this so-called 'Curse of the Flesh', but what he's really making are robotic slaves!<name>, we're pretty certain that he's still at the pumping station out in the middle of the pools to the east.The last we saw of him, he was in the command hut up top. Go up there and research his stuff.You must confront Mechazod if gnomes everywhere,... no, everyone everywhere, are to stay alive!"
3507,"Setting the Stage : I will give you a chance at continued existence.There are fragments of the power that fueled my curse scattered about the altar grounds. It is my desire that you collect some of them for me. Not so many that the curse will be lifted, but enough that I will be able to eventually make use of them to exact revenge upon my prophet.Go, insect. Run and do my bidding before I change my mind about letting you live."
3508,"Rampage : <name>, there is no time left. You must take the key and use it to unlock Akali.He is being held in the courtyard in front of Gundrak, the capital of Zul'Drak. Akali's chains are secured by four anchor points. You must unlock each of them to set the rhino god free.Gundrak is teeming with ice trolls.

Archmage Aethas Sunreaver himself will be expecting you!"
3511,"Knowledge is a Terrible Burden : Now you know what you're up against, <name>.  An opponent who no longer knows pain... remorse... or humanity.  An opponent who will do anything to get what he wants.The heart was his weakness and now he knows you've found it.If you're going to go back for it, you'd best bring help.  He will not leave it unguarded again."
3512,"In Service of the Unholy : The power of the unholy is coveted among my kind. It makes up the very fiber of our existence, granting death to those that dare make a mockery of it! Thankfully there is a font from which I may draw from in my time of need.Take this unholy gem and make your way to the Ruby Dragonshrine, east of here. It is there that you will find Duke Vallenhal, death knight of Arthas. Weaken his resolve in battle and unleash the power of the gem upon him. It will finish him off and steal his unholy energy!"
3513,"Spread the Good Word : Before I can ship you off to Doctor Malefious with the good news, you will have to run a simple field test of the blight with the modifications I have made.The hungering dead stream out from what remains of Old Wintergarde. Commandeer a vehicle from the east gate and drive it northeast through Vengeance Pass until you reach the twin towers at the southeastern edge of Wintergarde. Drop the blight bomb on the undead that cover the area. Report back to me with the results!"
3514,"Iron Rune Constructs and You: The Bluff : You always gotta have a contingency plan in case your main plan backfires! That's why I've built in some anti-intelligence systems into the construct.Your shiny new ride might rouse some suspicion while you're at Baelgun's excavation site. That's what your bluff ability is for! Just use that any time you're confronted and you'll be safe from harm.Test it out on Lebronski by walking on his rug. Once he starts huffin' and puffin', use the bluff!Get on the work bench when you're ready to begin."
3515,"The Spy in New Hearthglen : I have a spy within the ranks of the Scarlet Onslaught. I need you to deliver these daily orders to her so that she can plan the next phase of our assault.She goes by the name of Agent Skully and she's under a magical guise to appear as the Onslaught's cemetery caretaker.Here, take these orders to her, and then do as she asks. You'll find the graveyard on the side of the abbey."
3516,"Contributin' To The Cause : The bestest of the champions come to the chapel to hear the argent confessor speak every day.You should see how much she inspires them, <name>. Not only do they fight for the Argent Crusade, but they put a lot of money into the collection basket when I take it around.Maybe you'd like to contribute too?"
3517,"Gjalerbron Attack Plans : These plans detail an imminent attack upon Westguard Keep. It would appear that the frost wyrm, Glacion, who circles overhead is to be used for the offensive.Surely Mage-Lieutenant Malister would be of some assistance in this matter. Deliver the plans to him at the keep to the south."
3518,Return to Valgarde : 'Tis a shame we lost two of our best dwarves while uncovering these relics. They sacrificed their lives to keep this information safe.<Glorenfeld wraps the cipher and tablets in a tattered cloth.>Take these back to Valgarde. McSorf will know what to do with the find.As for me? I'll be alright on my own. I've gotten this far in one piece!

You have both air and ground targets on this mission, so keep your eyes open and your shields at full!Good luck!"
3520,"Arming Kamagua : Issliruk, the spirit of war, is depicted as a silver eagle by my people.  Our stories tell of how Issliruk fought against a hundred worgs to save his young.It is time for us, too, to fight against our foes to save our brethren.  We will need to craft new weapons.  The horns of the frostwing chimaera that make their home in the snowy parts of the island are sharp and are easily crafted into spear tips.  Bring me the best of these horns that you can find."
3521,"No One to Save You : We will spare no one. Outside, lowly necrolytes and their skeletal servants shame my land with their presence. Slaughter them all."
3522,"Force of Nature : I'm not sure about what I saw while flying to the northeast, but to me it looked like a gigantic woman kicking some Scourge butt.I'd heard the professor talk about a certain ""lifewarden""  appointed by the titans to look over Sholazar.  I might not be a titan historian, but it sounds like she fits the bill.I also know that if the Scourge cross the border between the Lost Lands and the rest of Sholazar, our expedition's as good as dead.  What do you say you go look for her and lend a hand?"
3523,"Plunderbeard Must Be Found! : There's been talk of a tunnel dug by Scourge that connects the embalming chambers of the mausoleum with the large crypts, now unearthed by Thel'zan and his minions. I recently sent my best rogue, Plunderbeard, in search of answers, but have yet to hear back from him. If I were a betting man I'd wager that he's a goner.I want you to go down those steps and head straight through the embalming chamber and look for Plunderbeard. Dead or alive, he'll have answers."
3524,"New Orders for Sergeant Stackhammer : <class>, you're here to help, right? I've got new orders for our forces that are currently deployed at the Drakkari altar to the north.You can't miss it. Just head straight up the avenue. Sergeant Stackhammer shouldn't be hard to find."
3525,"The Rider of Blood : Baelok is one of the few vrykul that I've ever seen rise through the ranks, and that was mostly accomplished through sheer brutality. If your competition ends up dead, there's far less to compete against.When you join battle with him, spread out from your companions and keep your distance as much as you reasonably can. He will not hesitate to steal your life force for himself, so you will need to hinder his ability to do so as much as possible.You have my confidence. See to it that he dies."
3526,"Coprous the Defiled : Reports of a powerful zombie at the death gate have reached my ears, <class>.We cannot allow a potential threat such as this to go unchallenged. Any information you are able to glean from engaging it will be better than what we know now.Go to the western chamber of the gate and find this creature. Fight him, and find a weakness we might exploit."
3527,"Mind Tricks : <The creature speaks directly into your mind, its thoughts painful and strange.><race>-thing, I am in need of your assistance. Like your enslaved friends, I am a victim of the Lich King's ymirjar and their avarice. When I rose from below to investigate the noises coming from this cavern they captured and chained me.Will you please help me? The foreman of these mines holds the key to my chains. Kill him!<You can feel a pushing against your mind as if the creature is trying to coerce you.>"
3528,"Guided by Honor : <Ares smiles.>Glory to the Light. You have done it!<Ares coughs.>Take the artifact and return it to Valgarde. Lord Irulon Trueblade awaits its return.Fight with honor, friend. Always. Honor.<Ares dies.>"
3529,"Drag and Drop : The Cult of the Damned hold the gate of desolation, eh? No surprise there.Time to have a little fun. At the southern end of the gate, you mentioned there were new cultists being trained. They're almost certain to be holding a special item given to all initiates - an Orb of Illusion.These artifacts are used to disguise a cult member, allowing them to gain safe passage, infiltrate, or simply blend in with an enemy.Kill the fools until you find one, <class>, then use it on a subjugator."
3530,"The Guardians of Corp'rethar : Corp'rethar, called the Horror Gate. It is the last barrier between us and the Icecrown Citadel. It waits to the south of the Ironwall Rampart, beyond the glacier and the Conflagration. By the time our troops reach it, they will be exhausted and worse.We must weaken its defenses, or our army's strength will break upon its walls.Its battlements are manned by some of the Lich King's fiercest and most zealous servants. Do all you can to destroy these guardians and hope it is enough."
3531,"Absholutely... Thish Will Work! : Voila, inshtant plague vacshine!But I sure as heck am not going to try thish on myself. And I know you don't want to be my tesht shubject!Oh, I've got... I've got an idea!We've got a vrykul prishoner being held down in the cells under the keep. Why don't you take thish mix I whipped up down there, and get that giant to drink it ...hic?!"
3532,"The Lodestone : We must find what's luring the giants northwest, so we can stop them before they reach their destination.While the rune samples gave us some clues, the unknown runes worry me.When I visited Giants' Run, I noticed a large broken tablet jutting from the ground where the northeastern part of the area met the snow at the foot of Frostblade Peak. Take this sample, compare the runes with the tablet, and see what you can learn about the identity of this lodestone."
3533,"Where the Wild Things Roam : Inside this pack are several vials containing the vaccine that Sintar created. I now want you to search the nearby woods for Snowfall elk and arctic grizzlies. When you locate the animals, find a safe distance and throw a vial in their general direction. The vial will shatter and release a fine gas that will act as the inoculating agent. The beasts merely have to step inside the gas and they will be vaccinated - ultimately saved.Inoculate as many of the beasts as you can and return to me."
3534,"Loken's Lackeys : The attack on the Terrace of the Makers was not a half-hearted move on my brother's behalf.  He sent a legion of iron dwarves and some of his most powerful lieutenants.Use the Horn of the Peaks to call the earthen to your side and defeat Loken's servants.You'll find the giant, Eisenfaust, inside the Hall of the Shaper to the north.  You'll find the others deeper inside the Terrace of the Makers, beyond the stairs to the northwest."
3535,"To Stars' Rest! : When you are ready I will place you on my fastest gryphon to Stars' Rest. Once you get there, find and speak with Archmage Modera.Good luck, ally!"
3536,"Leading the Ancestors Home : With your help, the ancestor spirits can now be guided to their rightful homes, the statues lovingly prepared by Kaskala's craftsmen and shaman.The ceremonies for these ancestors were interrupted during the attack on the quarry, and you will need to complete them. Take with you the objects that you recovered from the quarry, stand in front of the statues with the name markers, and recite this chant.<Words in a strange language flood your head, but you have no difficulty recalling them.>"
3537,"You Can Run, But You Can't Hide : Once the Scourge have a target in their sights, they'll stop at nothing to acquire it.You're doomed to a mindless existence as a walking corpse....<Stefan's face twists into a cruel grin.>... unless we can use their desires against them.I'll explain later. I have complex magic to prepare which requires certain material components.Travel due east of here to the Reliquary of Agony. Slay abominations and gather the ghoul drool you'll find there then return to me with their remnants."
3538,"Mission: Eternal Flame : The Forsaken are up to no good and from what I can tell, those plague tanks of sludge are a big part of it.If I may suggest, <sir/ma'am>, we should probably destroy them before they can get any more use out of the things. I took the liberty of preparing a bundle of torches from the Ember Clutch. These things have been burning for days!Here, I'm sure you can put them to better use than I in destroying those tanks."
3539,
3540,"A Short Fuse : As you light the fuse, you notice that it is consumed by fire far quicker than you would expect.The bombs are about to go off and your best chance at surviving is to lean towards the pit and hope the fall doesn't kill you."
3541,"The Amphitheater of Anguish: From Beyond! : I'm not gonna lie to you, pal. You might be overmatched here. This next one is a being from the elemental planes! I don't even know what's gonna show up in that arena!If you think you're up to it, get in there and give 'em hell!"
3542,Warchief's Command: Zul'Drak! : All able-bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Crusader Lord Lantinga in Zul'Drak.  The Scourge is massacring the local population in Zul'Drak and converting them over to be part of the Scourge army.  Assist the Argent Crusade and the Ebon Blade in stopping this threat.  For the Horde!
3543,"A Delicate Touch : I've been waiting an eternity for these mines! Well, a few days at least. What took him so long?Here's the low down, compadre... there's this nasty bunch of magnataur--you know, big, hairy, and extremely ugly--and they seem pretty keen on taking K3 for themselves.Not going to happen.We've got some defenses set up in their path, northeast of here. Sadly, our laser turrets have pretty limited power supplies... that's where these mines come in! Get over there and blow them up good!"
3544,Maintaining Discipline : You've succeeded where others have failed.  Yet you cannot rest on your laurels.You must show others what strength and commitment really mean.The male insubordinates inside the Forlorn Mine need to be disciplined once again.  Show them sister... show them what it means to disobey us.
3545,"Salvaging Life's Strength : The Lifeblood Pillar was toppled over with great force, sending the very earth into an upheaval.The elementals that wander the sundered shard carry with them the very life essence that gave the pillar its strength.  I cannot allow this energy to be wasted, for only four pillars remain.Head to the sundered shard, to the southeast, and seek the lifeblood elementals.Use this gem on their remains to recover their rampant energy.  We'll need the energy to heal the land when all this is over."
3546,"Destroy the Sapling : The furbolgs' work must be undone, <name>.  The best of intentions do not count for much when the result is tainted by such strong a corruption.The sapling must be destroyed, for it is the source of this dark influence.  Take this torch and use it to set fire to the corrupted sapling and bring me its ashes.Once cleansed, by fire, I will use what power I can to remove the taint from them.  You will need the ashes to purify Ursoc from the evil power that holds sway over him."
3547,"Spy Hunter : The rapport you've developed with the inhabitants of Dun Niffelem has yielded some unexpected discoveries.For example, you somehow find yourself able to understand the denmother's guttural growls and sharp quips--at least you think you do.It would seem that she senses danger outside the stronghold and wants you to do something about it.With her forepaw, she removes the chain from around her neck and lets it drop at your feet. As you pick it up you notice an aged fang attached to it..."
3548,"A Deserter : Unit S... Unit S.... hmmmpph.... don't make any sense... it oughta be named after a town...Darkshire was sent to Dragonblight.  The Goldshire boys were sent to the Fjord.   Where did I hear...Oh, yes... the deserter!  There's a turn-tail in the barracks prison.  Got thrown in not too long ago.  Kept saying that ""S"" stood for suicide.Look for the deserter.  He might have some information for you."
3549,"Revenge for the Vargul : I've been praying to The Lady of the Sword for one to come and strike down my enemy. Thane Illskar must pay for what he did to me!I was the champion of Thane Ufrang the Mighty. During my fight for ascendance in Valhalas, Illskar sabotaged me with dark magic, causing me to lose and be reduced to this.The thane and his champions can be found below in The Circle of Suffering. Challenge him on my behalf. Defeat him.Make him know the suffering that I know!"
3550,"Master the Storm : From what you describe, the creatures of metal should be easy to deal with. But first, you must master the storm.Behind me in the lodge is a totem. When you are ready, focus your will upon it and the storm will come. You must defeat the storm and in so doing take its essence into yourself.If others are there, it is enough that you all work together to defeat it. Return to me after, <class>."
3551,"Chain of Command : Based on your report, and my knowledge of the Cult, they have an overseer managing the operation of each encampment on the gate.While taking their leaders down will only be a temporary setback, it will at least slow them down and keep them off-balance. And that, <race>, is a worthy enough goal for now.Seek out these overseers and return to me when they have been dispatched."
3552,"Tua'kea's Crab Traps : With all of the troubles, I've lost my assistants. I was wondering if maybe you could help me?I have many crab traps under the waves of the harbor. Will you retrieve them for me? I'm too old for that sort of thing and the waters can be very dangerous.Please, take this bladder. It will help you to breathe while you're down there."
3553,"Black Blood of Yogg-Saron : Angrathar, the Wrathgate... I watched as the metal holding the gate together pulsed and undulated as if it were alive! In 50 years I've never seen metal ""breathe.""Only ones who knew anything about it were the tuskarr. They called it the ""Black Blood of Yogg-Saron"" and told me to keep my distance.There's a sinkhole outside Icemist Village to the west called the Pit of Narjun. I've heard of these sinkholes being rich with this strange ore. If you head that way, could you try and get me some samples?"
3554,"The Translated Tome : Here it is, <name>. I have translated everything printed upon the pages of the tome.

The red wyrms that fell in the shrine's defense now beset us in the form of twisted skeletal emberwyrms. The situation is dire, <race>.Captain Drayzen leads a group of your kind in stemming the flow of the Scourge out of the shrine.Go to his aid... but please stay behind his men. The flow of Scourge is endless and I don't want to lose you in one of those scarred canyons."
3556,"In Wine, Truth : The military was all that old man Colburn had.  After he retired, he still clung to it like a lifeline.He knows the name of every general, unit, brigade, detachment... you name it.  He's the man you need.Problem is, his mind is scarred.  He won't talk to anyone unless he gets his Kul Tiras wine.  Takes him back to the times he was a marine.I haven't received a shipment in months.  The last merchant ship out of Kul Tiras sunk northeast of here.  See if you can salvage a bottle to bring Colburn."
3557,"An End And A Beginning : Every good story has a beginning and an ending, <name>. While your story is far from over, I'll be damned if it's not already turning out to be the stuff of legend! No matter what happens to us when this is all over, what you've done at Wintergarde will be a tale told for years to come.Now, ally, when you are ready I will use the phylactery to coax Thel'zan out of hiding.Should we somehow succeed, report the victory to High Commander Halford Wyrmbane at Wintergarde Keep."
3558,"Burn in Effigy : Tuskarr magic is similar to what your people call shamanism. While we serve the elements differently than you, the power that we are able to call forth is formidable.<Waltor waves a torch-like baton in front of you.>With this tuskarr torch I want you to return to the mist and strike at the Kvaldir vessels. You will find three of their vessels docked behind the mist at Garrosh's Landing, north of here, and one docked off the shores of Pal'ea, to the south. Burn their ships in effigy! For all to see!"
3559,"Spill Their Blood : The Scourge cannot create their flesh monsters without blood and embalming fluid to preserve the parts and keep them functioning. If we can deny them these materials, their army will fall apart and we can easily destroy their creations.Throughout the labs where the flesh giants and abominations are cobbled together, you will find vats of embalming fluid and large orbs filled with blood. Destroy these, and bring death to any who would stop you!"
3560,Identifying the Remains : A whole tooth from a dead Kraken is a rare find indeed.  Crusader Silverdawn will want to see this.
3561,"The Amphitheater of Anguish: Tuskarrmageddon! : This next one's fightin' from a dark place, kid. The kind of dark that can only happen when you've been on the flip-side. He's hungry and willing to do whatever it takes to win. Watch yourself! I've heard he wrestles yetis for exercise!We'll start when you're ready."
3562,Something That Doesn't Melt : No no no! Those ice shards didn't work at all! They'll melt before they even do any damage. That's the last time I'll trust Narf's word on materials. This means we need something else entirely for the shrapnel.I know! I'm brilliant. Bone splinters.There are some bones all around here that the jormungar have been gnawing on pretty thoroughly. Go check them out and see if you can find me some splintered bone that I can use.
3563,"Mastering the Runes : I've got a set of picks, hammers, and chisels with me, but they won't work for carving these runes. The tools used by the Iron Dwarves are imbued with magic during their forging.When they're used to carve runes, the symbols form much more than mere words. These runes have the power to bind, compel, and twist.I believe I know how it works, but without a set of those tools, I can't be certain. Look for kits resembling mine near the Iron Dwarf pavilions at Giants' Run and bring them to me."
3564,"Strengthen the Ancients : The ancients of the Lothalor Woods to the south are being corrupted by arcane wyrms... wyrms which have risen out of the ground!Those that are already corrupted are deadly and of no use to us, but most can still be saved. Luckily, the treants of the woods seem to be immune to everything happening up there.Ask the treants for their bark and when you get some, feed it to the ancients. This should strengthen them.Now leave me to my business! I have to keep an eye on these apothecaries."
3565,"Lifeblood of the Mosswalker Shrine : I've always suspected that the pillars have been the main reason for our weather and seclusion from the undead... this confirms it a bit.Not terribly long ago, there was a sound of a great explosion when the Lifeblood Pillar fell. The weather changed for the mosswalkers almost immediately... it began to snow, something we never see.They were able to stop the snow by bringing more lifeblood crystals to the Great Moss Stone. Perhaps if we can do the same, it will help ward off the undead as well."
3566,"Deciphering the Journal : Vor'takh is right -- we cannot allow this opportunity to slip through our fingers.Fortunately, I think I know of a way to translate the journal of this Brann.The shamans of the Redfang furbolgs, who congregate at the Heart's Blood Shrine south of the camp, grow an herb known as spiritsbreath. An experienced mystic can use incense made from it to seek wisdom from the spirits of the ancestors.Seek out the shaman known as Grumbald One-Eye. He should carry the herb for his devotions to Ursoc."
3567,"Hit Them Where it Hurts : Bouldercrag's got a good plan to stymie the efforts of the iron dwarves at Narvir's Cradle, and I've got an idea of my own. Work on the iron colossus will come to a halt without any artisans.Narvir's Cradle is on the south side of the hill sheltering Bouldercrag's Refuge. Go there and slay any stormforged artificers in your path. They may be no different from what we once were, but they build a weapon that threatens us all."
3568,"Training In The Field : The tournament is a time for testing your skills against your peers, but we must not forget that the real enemy, the Scourge, will not wait. As you learn to master mounted combat, do not forget to practice the skills that have served you well all these years. Show us that you can face the Scourge with honor and bravery, and you will earn your right to compete in this tournament.Travel to Icecrown and slay any Scourge you see there, but stay clear of the Bombardment, where you would be overwhelmed."
3569,"The Demo-gnome : Quarterflash recently requisitioned my group for a specialist that he could send on a reconnaissance mission to the Wintergarde Mine. To that end, I sent him Slinkin, my demolitionist. I foolishly thought that he could close off that pit of damnation after his mission for Quarterflash was complete, securing another victory for us against the Scourge.An entire day has now passed and Slinkin has not returned. I want answers! Speak with Siege Engineer Quarterflash and track down my missing agent!"
3570,"Monitoring the Rift: Sundered Chasm : Did you feel that?! That was just an aftershock... you should've been here a few minutes ago!I'm afraid I must call upon your services again. My instruments indicate that there is an immense disruption just west of here, far beneath the water's surface.Just as before, I need you to take the arcanometer and capture the anomaly's data.I'll cast a spell that will enable you to breathe underwater. If it wears off before you find it, come let me know and I'll renew its effects."
3571,"To the Rise with all Due Haste! : Some would say that our most critical mission lies not with the Lich King, but with the utter destruction of the Scarlet Onslaught. I would say that is foolish, but who am I to judge?Death's Rise is far to the southwest, overlooking the sea along the cliff wall. There you will find Lord-Commander Arete personally overseeing the Onslaught's destruction himself.<The baron clears his throat.>Do see to it that you report to him with all due haste. He asked for you personally."
3572,"What Do You Feed a Yeti, Anyway? : The crusaders have captured a yeti that they're calling Icehowl. He's to be a participant in the coliseum battles and we've been asked to help with his training and upkeep.The crusaders weren't fond of my suggestion that we feed some Silver Covenant members to the beast. The creature prefers shark meat, so I want you to fly down to the Crimson Dawn, floating in the strait to the north. Get some fresh chum from one of the buckets on the boat, then spread it in the water to attract sharks."
3573,"Establishing Superiority : We've one shot at dealing some damage to this place -- let's make sure we get it right.We've acquired potent, Scourge-made, saronite bombs.  But we must secure this area before we can set them off.We're going to need to get the Scourge defenses under control quickly, before reinforcements arrive.Help my men out and come back when you're ready for some fireworks."
3574,"Our Only Hope : What I'm about to give you is called seaforium. It is a highly volatile explosive with some unique properties. Due to its malleable nature, you will be able to fill in the hinges and cracks of the cage for maximum damage.Return to your friend and use the jumbo seaforium charge to set him free.Let's hope he honors the bargain. He's our only hope."
3575,"Cruelty of the Kvaldir : I thank you for saving me, <name>.  The kvaldir are animals!They made us fight the other prisoners.  It would've been more merciful to just kill us all.The youngling Karuk is still alive -- I noticed him arrive here.  Tell him his father fought until the end."
3576,"Sharpening Your Talons : The primordial drakes occupy most of the area to the north and east, and I can feel the heat of their breath even at this distance. Before we can challenge the mightiest among the drakes, we must test our skills against the lesser creatures.Still, don't let your guard down; any one of these beasts can devour a man whole. Once you've familiarized yourself with the combat tactics of these drakes, return and I will tell you our next step."
3577,"From Their Corpses, Rise! : How kind... how generous our lord-commander is. Where he is flowers and sunshine, I am filled only with hatred.It is not enough to end their miserable lives... I want them humiliated... debased!What could be more unspeakable than to be turned into that which you hate? To dedicate your existence to eradicating a thing, and then in the end to become it?How sad.Take this tincture northwest to Onslaught Harbor. Apply it to their still corpses and watch what happens, but avoid the cathedral."
3578,"A Visit to the Curator : The leader of the mage hunter forces is a fearsome creature called Curator Insivius. My people have hunted the beasts of the seas and land for countless generations, but I've never seen anything like this curator before.He's landed one of those flying disks on the upper rim of the quarry and oversees the operation from there. <name>, I can only believe the ancestors themselves sent you to my rescue and I hope you will help me drive the mage hunters from this quarry once and for all."
3579,Crush Dem Vrykuls! : Dem vrykuls at the Jotunheim needs to be crushed!<name> crush dems good!
3580,Tank Ain't Gonna Fix Itself : We need to get these tanks back up and runnin'! They ain't gonna fix themselves. Mobu's gonna be the one to handle that stuff. Talk to him and see what he needs. Maybe you can shut him up before he finally drives me into a berserker frenzy and I cleave him in two!
3581,"Seeking Solvent : Gah! Not again. Another blown gasket....Every time one of these goes, lubricant gums up all of the gears. Without solvent, it takes hours to clean.Tell ya what, <race>. There's some fancy rocket fuel on the Venture Company barge in the dock there - element 115 I think they call it. That stuff makes for a great solvent.Get me one of those and I'll make it worth your trouble."
3582,"Might As Well Wipe Out the Scourge : If the cultists up in those caves survived the crash, then that fallen necropolis to the west can only be assumed to still be filled with Scourge. There're probably lots of them out in front of it in the pools, too!While you're at Talramas, <class>, do you think you could dispatch all of the Lich King's flunkies that you find there?"
3583,"Shaved Ice : I've never seen you before... are you new to the Vice?  Glad to have you.  I could always use some more hands.You get the materials, I'll finish my machine, then we can sell it to those commander types and all go home rich.I actually have most of the primary components, so I just need some of the materials for the weapon itself.  Narf said that jagged ice shards from those elementals to the north would make perfect shrapnel for my bombs - go nab some, will ya?"
3584,"Delivery to Krenna : This is it, mon.  Let's take these hides to Krenna and see if they pass the test.Let's hope for both our sakes Krenna doesn't notice anything."
3585,"Return to the Spirit Talker : You have done what was asked, and now I give you that which you desire.Deliver this primal to the spirit talker back at your Bor'gorok Outpost. If she is wise, she will know a ritual to gain you the information which you seek."
3586,"Attack on Silverbrook : A few hours ago, the trappers were nothing but peasants threatening to add their number to the Alliance's.Now they've become something else... an uncertainty.  I do not like uncertainties.  Go to the hills outside their main town in northern Grizzly Hills, Silverbrook, and help my men crush them."
3587,"Dressing Down : There... I've created a disguise that should make you indistinguishable from the Scourge.You'll be free to walk among them as long as the disguise holds. Only the blightguards will be able to see through my illusion. Watch out for them!Another thing you must know is that the disguise is unstable and may drop unexpectedly, so stay alert.Let's test it out. Use the choker and visit the Scourge merchant just east of here. Return to me with a bottle of bitter plasma."
3588,"Fury of the Frostborn King : <As you retrieve the core from the chest, you hear the thumping of heavy footsteps rushing towards you from the corridor. There is the faint sound of battle in the distance.>"
3589,"The Explorers' League Outpost : It's all a bunch of cryptic nonsense! Even with this cipher I can't make heads or tails of these tablets. Admittedly, cryptography is not my strong point.You'll need to take the cipher and tablets to our cryptographer, Stanwad. Unfortunately, I haven't heard from Stanwad in two weeks. He took a team of twenty scientists to the dig sites on the southeastern bluffs of the fjord and hasn't been heard from since. The best I can do is have McGoyver over there give you a lift with his flying machine."
3590,"Freya's Pact : The cultists have been taken care of, but the Scourge's invasion has not slowed down.  The situation is becoming desperate, <name>.There exists a last resort.  Before I reveal any more, however, I must be sure I have your absolute trust."
3591,"The Lost Spirits : In the attack on the quarry, the shaman and craftsmen working here were slain. The violence threw the spirit world into utter chaos and we'll be unable to guide the ancestors home unless we find a way to soothe the spirits of the murdered.The aggressors themselves pay no heed to the spirits, but their companions, the beryl hounds, sense the spirits and hold them in thrall.Kill the beryl hounds, and using the raw energy left behind, break the imprisonment of the spirits of the innocent."
3592,"Audience With The Dragon Queen : Our assault against Angrathar has staggered the Scourge, but they remain unrelenting. From overhead they send their frost wyrms to strafe the field of battle, making an advance upon the gate itself impossible. The frost wyrm attacks must be stopped, but before we defile the bones of ancient dragons, we must gain permission from their queen.Travel southeast to Wyrmrest Temple and seek out Queen Alexstrasza. Tell her what we must do and ask her for guidance.Go now, <name>!"
3593,"Speak with your Ambassador : <The dragon in elf form takes your letter of introduction, perusing it for a moment and then stashing it away within his sleeve.>Everything seems to be in order. However, if you don't mind, I would ask that you speak with your ambassador here at the temple.He has something of great import for you that needs taking care of before we send you up to the queen.<He pats at the letter under his sleeve.>I'll keep this safe for you until your return."
3594,"Honor is for the Weak : Ghouls are fragile things when it comes down to it, and the lookouts at the saronite quarry down the path to the southwest are no exception. Using one of the shades, I have no doubt that you can sneak up and put down their lookouts without making a sound.Clear out as many lookouts as you can reach in a reasonable amount of time... we'll want their ranks thinned for our assault to come."
3595,"Feedin' Da Goolz : Git o'er heer, gool! Yeh, I talkin' to yoo.It feedin' time now. Gotta git da grub ta all da gools!Speshal grub dis time! Bowels an' brainz bowl... num, num, num.Jus drop da bowl nexta da gool. Gud way ta make frenz.Yoo got goolfrenz? Ha, ha, hah!"
3596,"Happy as a Clam : To the west of us you will find Lake Kum'uya. It is, as far as we know, the only freshwater giant clam habitat in the world.Of course Nesingwary's lackeys are now using the lake as a giant pearl farm. They must be stopped! A lesson must be taught to those that would think to endanger an entire species.Go to Lake Kum'uya and locate the loot crazed divers. Slay them until the water runs red! Return to me when a proper example has been made!"
3597,"Blood of the Chosen : Those vrykul that have gained the favor of the Lich King call themselves the Ymirjar. They inhabit a city in the center of Icecrown. We have a lot of preparations to make before we assault Icecrown Citadel, and the one that stands before us now is routing these so-called ""Chosen"" of the Lich King.Go to their city, Ymirheim, and slaughter them in their home. Let there be no questions as to who the stronger combatants are here."
3598,"Nozzlerust Defense : You, <class>!  These undead south of us are being a constant nuisance to our work.  Go clear them out, will ya?"
3599,"The Flesh-Bound Tome : The tome is bound in flesh and appears to be bleeding. Upon examination you discover page after page filled with strange symbols that appear to be written in blood.Whatever knowledge is held within the pages of this tome could be important. Return it to Captain Gort at Agmar's Hammer, east of Icemist Village."
3600,"Mr. Floppy's Perilous Adventure : Excuse me, <Mister/Ma'am>, do you know the way back to the soldiers' camp?Mr. Floppy and I decided to go for a walk in the woods, and my brother Walter was gonna come with us, but then he had squire things to do.So Mr. Floppy and I went by ourselves, but we got lost, and there were a whole bunch of hungry wolves, but we found this tower.The wolves went away, but we're still lost.I asked Mr. Floppy, and he doesn't know the way back. Would you help us? Please?"
3601,"Let Them Not Rise! : I don't understand it. The blight should have worked!No sense worrying about it now.<The apothecary seems relieved for some reason.>Though it doesn't work on the Onslaught for some strange reason, we still need to keep their priests from raising them.I have another idea, one that their corpses shouldn't have any protection from.<name>, take a container of my rats and unleash them upon any Onslaught corpses you come across at New Hearthglen. I starve the vermin, so they should be voracious!"
3602,"The Spare Suit : Very well, your king's secret is safe with me as long as he continues to help us against our enemies.Here, take this to him. I cleaned it up nicely, though I have no idea why he needs a second disguise.Maybe he has something in mind for you?"
3603,"Song of Reflection : Of course you not as smart as gorloc!  You just simple <race>.You not without hope, though!  You show you can learn.  Maybe crystals make you smart like crystals make us smart!I teach you to play song to clear your mind.  You play song by crystals then crystals make your mind better... not as good as gorloc's but better than you have now.  Lifeblood Pillar is broken, but other pillars still good!"
3604,"The Murkweed Elixir : The spirits of the damned haunt the coast. In life they were brave and noble soldiers of the Alliance, but in death they are cursed - bound to this world until the end of days. We must discover the source of their anguish if we are to free them!To the southeast, on the Eldritch Heights, you will find a rare herb known as murkweed. It is murkweed that I will use to concoct an elixir that will allow you temporary entry into the world of the forgotten. Go now and gather the weed."
3605,"Bringing Down the Iron Thane : Now that the golem is fully charged, it can be used against the leader at Dun Argol.When I observed Iron Thane Furyhammer, he was always guarded by a personal golem that shielded him from all harm.That construct, called The Anvil, can be disrupted, causing him to drop the shield. Use your golem's EMP ability to do just that. You'll be able to activate and take control of your golem inside Dun Argol.The thane is in the main plant at the top and supervises production from the bottom level."
3606,"A Sister's Pledge : Please, <name>.  I know it is Arugal you're after.  I swear on my father's memory I will help you take him down.But I must beg you... Anya is completely innocent, we cannot leave her with these savages.Help me rescue my sister and you'll have me at your side when you face Arugal.I know the den Anatoly spoke of.  We'll find it on the other side of this hill.  Let's go, my sister's in danger."
3607,"Battle at Valhalas: Khit'rix the Dark Master : A variety of beings travel the world to prove themselves within Valhalas. Some even come from under the world.Khit'rix the Dark Master is one such.Hailing from deep within the ground where insanity reigns, Khit'rix has asked for someone exotic to face in the ring. You will do.Dare you face this Nerubian nightmare, <race>?"
3608,"Reclusive Runemaster : Dregmar Runebrand is a magnataur runemaster... a rare breed. He's generally solitary, but has been known to associate with the more powerful and influential magnataur in Dragonblight for quite some time. He will know who this new leader is. It is unlikely we will gain any aid with the increasing concerns with the Scourge and the blue flight, so I need you to procure the information from Dregmar by any means necessary.I was told he can be found amongst the cliffs overlooking the Mirror of the Dawn."
3609,"Forging a Head : Greetings, <race>.I have a task that King Jokkum felt you would be suited for, assuming you still strive to gain favor with our people.I have developed plans for another artifact, one that will grant Hodir's blessing of protection to our stronghold. I have nearly all that I require for its construction. All that remains to collect are the very eyes of our fallen enemies.Take this tool, and gather the eyes from the iron giant corpses that litter our fields."
3610,"Descent into Darkness : The journal was written by a denizen of Silverbrook named Mikhail.  It details the arrival of a shadow-worshipping group called the ""wolfcult.""The villagers were reluctant to embrace the cult at first, but sympathizers sprung up gradually among town residents.Unsettled by this, Mikhail sent his daughter Sasha away from Silverbrook while he attempted to reason with the other villagers.Mikhail's last entry mentions a meeting of local town leaders to discuss unspecified events in Hollowstone Mine."
3611,"Going After the Core : With Norgannon's Shell in hand, only half of the archive key remains to be found. Luckily, I've had the Explorers' League hard at work chasing down leads about the whereabouts of Norgannon's Core.Far to the southeast of the Inventor's Library, on the slopes to the north of Dun Niffelem, is a camp bearing my name. The Explorers' League representatives seeking the second half of the key are based there. Bring me the maps and the notes they've made and we should be able to track down the other key half."
3612,"Loken's Orders : I've created everything else you'll need for your overseer disguise kit. Try not to retch when you put it on. I took pains to make it as true to reality as possible.Take the kit with you southeast to Dun Argol, use it to disguise yourself, then go to the easternmost building on the broad middle tier of the city.There, you should see a pedestal where the thane and overseers receive their orders from this Loken. Activate it while disguised and learn all you can from the communication."
3613,"A Bot in Mammoth's Clothing : I've reconfigured the skeleton of an old bot to create an earthquake large enough to collapse the tunnels, but the machinery is delicate and sensitive to Northrend's biting cold.I've devised a means of insulating it using the thickest hides of the native mammoths. They roam the plains south of the airstrip and adjacent to the Geyser Fields. Bring back enough of the hides for me to finish the machine and then we'll be able to unleash it on the Nerubians!"
3614,"Close Call : It was either wisdom or luck that prevented you from wearing this choker, <race>.Either way, your acquiring it was no random occurence. You've been targeted by someone, or something....Take your choker to Bloodrose, here. Let her demonstrate the fate that nearly befell you."
3615,"Trophies of Gammoth : We cannot take all of the credit for this Horde victory, <name>. It was you who risked your life to test the bloodspore and it was you who ultimately put an end to Gammothra.Honor us by returning to Warsong Hold and presenting the head of Gammothra to Lord Hellscream."
3616,"Slay Loguhn : Already it goes from bad to worse. There is only one course to take... regrettably, Loguhn must die!He's the alpha male of the Snowfall Glade tribe and one mean wolvar. But it's the only way to get a short break from their attacks and stealing forays.You will find the ""Render of Flesh"" in front of his hovel upon the northern rise of the glade. It's larger than the others and hard to miss. Kill him and smear his blood upon yourself, both to show your dominance and respect."
3617,"Sneak Preview : Progress is being made. We have a promising array of tactics that should gain us control of the death gate. There will doubtlessly be many casualties, but in the end,  we should be able to prevail - barring any interference from those Horde you insist on contending with...At any rate, our next focus will be the gate of desolation. Fly down and become familiar with it and with the enemies posted there.When you return, I will have your missions prepared."
3618,"At One : I was charged with her protection, yet it was she who sacrificed herself for my sake.I cannot bear to lose her, <name>. I must make a solemn request of you.Never has a mortal borne the essence of a true dragon, but with your permission I would make an exception.Please, while there is life in her, will you allow me to bind Tarecgosa to you?"
3619,"Making Peace : We have great idea. You were friends with puppy-men, they maybe listen to you.We want you to go give offering to Shaman Vekjik. He southwest where river turns into waterfall.  Tell puppy-man we no want fight. Tell him we play nice.You good <race>. We trust you do this right."
3620,"The Denouncement : It's time for us to utterly demoralize the Onslaught forces!I want you to take the rod and use it on four of their leaders: Commander Jordan upstairs at the barracks, Lead Cannoneer Zierhut down the southeast ramp overlooking the beach, Blacksmith Goodman at the smithy, and Stable Master Mercer at the stables.Place them under the rod's compulsion, concentrate on making them denounce the Onslaught, and then kill them!"
3621,"Put on Your Best Face for Loken : Using the images you've captured, I've created everything you need for your overseer disguise kit. You'll make a fine iron dwarf, if I do say so myself.Take the kit with you to Dun Argol, use it to disguise yourself, then go to the easternmost building on the broad middle tier of the city.There, you should see a pedestal where the thane and overseers receive their orders from this Loken. Activate it while disguised and learn all you can from the communication."
3622,"Through Fields of Flame : I have one final task for you, <race>... one that should turn the tide of this fight.Return to the shrine and kill the necromancers that are fueling this onslaught. With them dead, we should be able to beat these forces back and eventually retake the shrine.I also need you to find the source of the corruption under the shrine and put an end to it.I know I have asked a lot of you, but if you do this for me, we will win this battle."
3623,"The Heroic Key to the Focusing Iris : A potent thrumming of magical nature can be heard and felt emanating from the eye-shaped jewel dropped from Sapphiron's clutches. To mortal ears it is nearly painful to be in the presence of the stone.Surely such a powerful item of import can only be taken to the queen of the dragons, Alexstrasza the Life-Binder. Seek her counsel atop Wyrmrest Temple in the Dragonblight."
3624,"The Abandoned Reach : We have just gotten word from Liandra that mercenaries hired by Nesingwary are moving goods off the beach and onto the main Nesingwary shipping vessel. No doubt they plan on making a fortune from their murderous trade!She has asked that we send assistance to the Abandoned Reach, directly south of here on the beachfront of the Borean Tundra.Make haste, Liandra awaits you there!"
3625,"Weapons for Farshire : Farshire is overrun and all that Gerald can think of is to get me my ore shipment?  I swear that man has as much heart as any of our soldiers on the frontlines.We cannot let the civilians lose their lands if they're willing to fight for them.  We might not have the troops to spare, but we can send them weapons.These were earmarked for new recruits, but I'll be able to cover those with the ore you've brought me.  Send word to Gerald that weapons are on the way."
3626,"Retest Now : Those twisted cultists are looking for souls to put in their crazy-juice? Then let's help 'em out a bit!Take a swig of this - don't worry, I've diluted it plenty... I'm almost positive that its only effect will be to detect any cultist's essence.Once you've collected a bunch of 'em, throw the writhing mass of twisted souls in one of their cauldrons.Let's see how they like a taste of their own medicine!"
3627,Weapons of Destruction : The Lich King's lackeys have dared to bring weapons of destruction into my domain.  I will not stand for this.Go to their outpost to the north and destroy the weapons they would use against the land.  We cannot let the Scourge taint another inch of these sacred lands.
3628,"The Darkness Beneath : Something... dark... happened to the tree Vordrassil.  After the druids decided to destroy it, its hollow remains grew roots deep into the ground.I want you to go to the three locations to the northeast where the tree's trunk shattered and go as far beneath the ground as you can.Use this orb once you get there to get an imprint of the energy surrounding the area.  This might shed some light on what happened to Vordrassil and why it failed to become a world tree."
3629,"Vordrassil's Sapling : The druids of old seem to have had good reasons for destroying Vordrassil.  We cannot let the furbolgs regrow it.On the other hand, saving Ursoc's spirit hinges on the magic contained by the sapling.Take this torch and use it to burn the tree.  You will find it in the middle of Grizzlemaw, inside Vordrassil's old trunk.Bring me Vordrassil's ashes.  It is my hope that once purified by fire, we may use its magic to cleanse Ursoc's spirit of its dark taint."
3630,"What the Cold Wind Brings... : You hold the carapace fragment of Ith'rix the Harvester and realize that this is only the beginning. Even now you sense that victory is fleeting. Surely the Lich King has a thousand more beasts like Ith'rix, waiting to be unleashed upon the Horde.Take your trophy and present it to High Overlord Saurfang, inside Warsong Hold. He should be notified of your victory over a powerful Scourge agent."
3631,"Bloodspattered Banners : In the Valley of Fallen Heroes and Icecrown Glacier, to the west of Aldur'thar, the Scourge seeks to use the fallen against us. Scourge lieutenants have woken the valley's dead and imbued them with fearsome strength and fervor. The banners carried by the Scourge leaders in the glacier area are the source of these powers. Kill the banner-bearers, and you will weaken the converted heroes they lead.It falls to you to rid us of this obstacle, and test the resistance before the main body can advance."
3632,"Securing the Perimeter : The saronite bombs are in place, <name>.  We're only going to get one shot at this, however.  Let's make it count.We need temporary control of the area for a safe detonation.  Let's try to put a dent in the Scourge's numbers."
3633,"Crocolisk Mastery: The Trial : I warn you, stranger -- do not make any comments about crashing the ship. I already get enough of it from the rest of the expedition.If you're looking to try your hand at hunting, though, you should test your skills against the wily mangal crocolisks. They live all along the river to the south, and in the Wildgrowth Mangal to the east. Prove you can hold your own against them and we'll talk again, hunter."
3634,"Wanton Warlord : There's no reason to suspect Dregmar's words are anything but true. Whether Grom'thar defeats you or is defeated by you, he can wash his hands of this.Follow his instructions... take the horn that you brought me earlier, travel to the ring of torches south of the Azure Dragonshrine, and blow it to announce your challenge.When Grom'thar the Thunderbringer arrives, kill him and bring me his head."
3635,"A Valiant's Field Training : The tournament is a time for testing your skills against your peers, but we must not forget that the real enemy, the Scourge, will not wait. As you hone your skills against others, so should you maintain your edge in combat against the enemy.Travel to the area southwest of the Valley of Fallen Heroes and north of Corp'rethar. There, the Scourge raises dead heroes and turns them against us. Defeat these minions of the Scourge, do honor to our allies, and keep yourself prepared for combat."
3636,"Runes of Compulsion : Even as Kurun attacks Thor Modan, the iron dwarves work their magics against our brothers. Summoning our brothers from the earth, then binding them with runes, the sons of iron force them to war against the children of stone.Along the Eastwind Shore, they use runes of compulsion to send enslaved giants to the battlefields of the north.Find the four runes of compulsion and force their overseers to appear by defeating the rune-weavers who man each rune. Without the overseers, the runes are useless."
3637,"Why Fabricate When You Can Appropriate? : We've got the blueprints, but we can't do anything with them without parts! We don't have access to a foundry, much less materials, but there's a whole load of parts up in Dun Argol.Your job?Give them a new home.They're likely to be scattered around any of the buildings where the iron rune-smiths are working, and I wouldn't blame the irons for being cranky when you try to filch their handiwork. The more parts you can bring, the better we can make this golem."
3638,"Understanding the Language of Death : Take the book and follow the path leading up to the barracks. Once inside the barracks take the staircase down to the prison. At the prison you will find Inquisitor Hallard and our mayor, Godfrey. I believe Godfrey might be the missing piece of this puzzle and Hallard the man to put it all together.Go now!"
3639,"In Strict Confidence : If anyone knows where the admiral is, then surely it must be his captains on the ships in Onslaught Harbor.<The lord-commander rubs his hands together.>Welsington and Hartford are their names if memory serves. Go beat the information out of them and then end their miserable lives.I want to know where the grand admiral is hidden!"
3640,"Untold Truths : We are here by order of Varimathras! The mission of the Shadowstalkers is a simple one: spy. Well, spy with a little assassination on the side.One of my best field agents has gone missing. I haven't heard from him in days, which has left me fearing the worst. No, not death! Death would be ideal. I fear he may have gone rogue... turned traitor even.His last known location was northern Mightstone Quarry. He was gathering intelligence on the Nerubians. Find him.He better be dead..."
3641,"Let the Baron Know : The most important thing that you can do right now is to return to The Shadow Vault and let Baron Sliver know that I've failed.You see, I wasn't the only one captured by these vrykul devils. My entire contingent of death knights was also taken.I should have seen the trap before it was sprung, but there's no use crying over spilled milk now is there?Go on before you get captured, too! I'll see you back at the vault."
3642,"The Rider of Frost : Sapph... Sapph's a death knight like no other. She'll shower you with sweet words and you'll swear that she has no evil within her heart, and then she'll run you through without even breaking her smile.I have no fear that you'll be able to best Sapph, but do not grow overconfident. Her strength lies in lulling her victims into a false ease, shortly before shattering them with a fierce barrage of frost attacks.Do not let your guard down, and do not underestimate her."
3643,"Emergency Protocol: Section 8.2, Paragraph C : Injured or not, as squadron commander, I'm responsible for locating and returning the insignia of all fallen pilots under my command. In all the years I've flown with Fizzcrank, we've never failed to return the signet of a pilot.My injuries make it dangerous for me to stray far from the safety of the wreckage, but perhaps you would be willing to help me recover the insignia? In the meantime, I'll make preparations to carry out my final duty as squadron commander."
3644,"The Ironwall Rampart : The Ironwall Rampart overlooks the Valley of Fallen Heroes, west of Aldur'thar. The rampart dominates the fields below on all sides. We will not be able to advance if the rampart cannot be taken, but it is held by Grimkor the Wicked and his Cult of the Damned disciples.If you can weaken Grimkor, our forces will know what to expect as we advance. Take this rune of distortion. Unleashing its power near Grimkor's orb at the end of the rampart should be enough to get the necromancer's attention."
3645,"In Search of the Ruby Lilac : How fortuitous it is that the Ruby Dragonshrine lays just to the east. It is there that you will find a flower called the ruby lilac. This lifegiving plant is all that I need to concoct a vaccine for the untainted beasts of this region.Travel east and search the Ruby Dragonshrine for the lilac.Just one thing: The dragonshrine, like all the dragonshrines in this blasted wasteland, is beset by the Scourge. Watch your step. We wouldn't want you to be devoured by an emberwyrm.<Sintar laughs.>"
3646,"In Service of Frost : The biting cold protects the death knight while repelling his enemies. He that commands the power of frost can incite chaos and destruction!Take this frost gem and travel far across the open tundra of the Dragonblight until you come upon the Mirror of Dawn, east of Wyrmrest Temple. It is there that you are to battle the legions of ice revenants that dwell upon the lakes surface and take from them the essence of frost. Utilize the power of the gem when they are weak, <name>!"
3647,"Can't Get Ear-nough... : Whether they be treasure seekers or bloodthirsty hunters of the wastes, any being that supports Nesingwary and does dare strike at our beloved wildlife shall be considered an enemy of D.E.H.T.A. Should you slay these filthy Nesingwary sympathizers, bring me proof of their demise and you shall be rewarded with a blessing from the druids of D.E.H.T.A."
3648,Baleheim Bodycount : Them vrykuls just keeps coming and coming out from town west of here.  No end in sight!Gorth has an idea.  You go INSIDE town and kill them Winterskorn there.  THEN they stop coming here!
3649,"Shatter the Shards : Atop the battlements of Corp'rethar, the Lich King's minions have erected three crystals, the shards of horror, despair, and suffering. Should our men reach the walls of Corp'rethar, he will unleash these weapons on our army.In full effect, the crystals will afflict the minds of our men with paralyzing pain and fear. Then, the Scourge will be able to slaughter them at will.Find these shards, destroy them, and bring me their broken remains. We cannot allow the Lich King to deploy these weapons!"
3650,"Of Traitors and Treason : The list I hold must be delivered to High Commander Halford Wyrmbane. He commands the 7th Legion, stationed at Wintergarde Keep on the eastern borders of Dragonblight.If any of the traitors on this list are stationed at Wintergarde... it could be catastrophic.Hurry, <name>. Show the document to Palena Silvercloud here at Stars' Rest and explain the nature of your mission. She will put you on her fastest hippogryph to Wintergarde!"
3651,"Out of My Element? : Keep it down, <race>. These iron dwarves are quick on the trigger. Now don't let the activities down in the dig fool you. Those steel-skinned abominations aren't digging anything up! No sir - on the contrary - they're burying the site! For whatever whacked out reason, they don't want anyone finding this place.What kind of dwarf buries ancient relics and dig sites? I'll tell you what kind: the kind you kill with reckless abandon! Get in there and take 'em out!"
3652,"The Best of Intentions : The Cult of the Damned has not come just to extract power from dead dragons. I suspect I know what they are up to, but I need you to prove me correct.I will grant you the guise of this dead necrolyte. Proceed to the back of the cave and confirm their intentions for being in this sacred place. I will watch through your eyes. Be cautious <name>, any damage done to you is likely to break the fragile illusion."
3653,"The Hero's Arms : Not all of the camp's records have yet been corrupted. My staff has helped me to find those records which reflect the true timeline.They agree that Stormhoof was given a burial of honor among the village elders on the bottom level of the Howling Hollow, to the north.Most of the graves there have already been destroyed, their contents taken as trophies by the North Wind's subjects. Go to the hollow and see if you can recover Stormhoof's spear and armor from the scions of storm who have claimed them."
3654,"Keymaster Urmgrgl : I have to get out of these caverns! There's magic stuff seeping in from Coldarra, above, and affecting everyone's minds.I don't intend to be controlled like these others!Keymaster Urmgrgl is in the cave below and to the south. He holds the key to my cage. Get it from him and bring it back so that I can unlock my cage and get out of here.Hurry!"
3655,"We Have the Power : Well, we've got the shell of a golem, but that's not good enough for Tormak. He doesn't realize that these things don't just come together and miraculously start working! We're going to need power cells to animate it.When I was in Dun Argol, I noticed that Rune-Smith Durar and Rune-Smith Kathorn were the ones who manufactured the cells. We'll need one from each to power our golem.You should be able to find each rune-smith in his workshop on the central level of Dun Argol."
3656,"Reforging the Key : Delays, delays... the one thing we cannot afford right now!As much as I hate to disturb Lord Surristrasz, he's our only hope of saving our beloved Evanor.Bring him the key fragments and hope that his mood is favorable.Hurry, <class>, our assault team is waiting."
3657,"Gruesome, But Necessary : We've had reports that these vrykul can rise from the dead; not unlike the Scourge, but a different kind of undeath.Let's not take any chances.Here, take my machete. As we move through this place, you'll need to carve up the remains of the vrykul that we take down. I'd do it, but I have a sensitive stomach.<The sergeant smirks.>I spent all morning sharpening it, so it should do the job."
3658,"Zedd's Probably Dead : To whomever finds this journal:These bloodthirsty monsters have taken up residence in the ruins of Wyrmskull. What they want or why they're here is a mystery. In any case, the artifacts are not safe with those beast-men around.Zedd and I made a new discovery while hiding out: a cipher to decode the tablets! Unfortunately Zedd and I were separated late last night. He had the cipher. Tablets were with Glorenfeld and Daegarn. Location unknown...Find Zedd.-Pulroy"
3659,"Your Presence is Required at Stars' Rest : <class>, I know these tuskarr will ask you to do many favors for them, but you must get to Stars' Rest with all due haste!The upheaval in the land this morning is sure to have broader repercussions than just inconveniencing the natives.Stars' Rest is westward past the intersection of the road leading north out of the harbor. There is an archmage there named Modera. She will be expecting you."
3660,"Stunning Defeat at the Ring : Oluf will come out if you defeat the other gladiators. That's 'bout the only way we're getting' that cipher back. Put on your whompin' boots and get busy in the Ring of Judgment. If you do manage to get the cipher back, return it to Glorenfeld o'er near the entrance to these catacombs.Me? Don't worry about me! We're on the brink of discovering the missing link to human-kind!"
3661,"Stocking Up : Hello hello!  The Scourge to the south are digging up some ancient dragon thing.  I could care less why they're doing it, but they're pulling cartloads of composite ore in the process.Go lift me a bunch of that ore.  That stuff should yield a pretty penny for all the weapons the Horde are crafting."
3662,"Memories of Stormhoof : When the bronze dragonflight gifted me with immortality and set me on the path of the witness, Nozdormu entrusted me with the Lorehammer.The hammer's reaction to your findings means that time has gone awry here and it is our duty to restore the true timeline.We must find it. To the northwest is Frostfloe Deep, ancient burial cave of the warriors of Tunka'lo. Seek out the spirit of Chieftain Swiftspear, Stormhoof's brother. Ask him what he remembers of his brother's battle against the North Wind."
3663,"The Search for Slinkin : While I have not heard from Slinkin or know what fate has befallen him, perhaps I can assist in finding him.<Quarterflash holds up a tiny mechanical toy.>This is not a toy, newfound compatriot. It is, in fact, my latest mechanical creation. The machine was created with the sole purpose of finding that which has been lost. These are unfortunate circumstances, but the machine is your best chance at finding Slinkin.When you are ready to begin your search, place the bot on the ground next to me."

My heart swells with pride to see that such a distinguished hero of the Horde has answered the call of duty!This impregnable fortress is a testament to the tenacity of the Horde.

3665,"WANTED: High Shaman Bloodpaw : Posted by: DrolfyWhile out in the Eldritch Heights with my cousins, Skrotee and Brote, a vicious band of wolvar from the Bloodpaw tribe attacked us. We attempted to flee, but I fear they got Skrotee and Brote.I demand retribution! Is there someone brave enough to venture to the southeastern reaches of Dragonblight, to the Eldritch Heights, and kill High Shaman Bloodpaw and his cronies?I have given a hefty sum of gold to Highlord Leoric Von Zeldig to disperse to anyone that claims this bounty!"
3666,"The Black Knight's Curse : I wanted to remove the Black Knight's remains from the tournament grounds after your victory, but Confessor Paletress insisted that he receive a decent burial. Ever since, a dark presence has lingered in the cemetery and people are afraid to go there to visit the fallen.Would you visit the cemetery just past the eastern end of the tournament grounds and see if you can discover what's happening?"
3667,"Battle at Valhalas: The Return of Sigrid Iceborn : An old foe of yours has returned: Sigrid Iceborn. Perhaps you remember besting her in a duel upon the Savage Ledge?No matter, she certainly remembers you. She's insisting upon a chance to prove herself once more.Personally, I think it's more a chance for revenge, but that too can be useful in this place.I leave it up to you, <name>. Will you face Sigrid Iceborn once more?"
3668,"Field Test : Now that we have a strain of the plague that has adapted to vrykul carriers, we really ought to test it on our specimens in Halgrind.  If all goes according to plan, they will disintegrate immediately as the plague devours their innards!You will find Halgrind north of here.  Our plaguebringers are deploying the previous strain there - shouldn't be hard to spot."
3669,Gunship Down : The Archstone was being transported inside a flying Horde gunship called the Storm's Fury.The airship crashed south of here and our scrying has revealed the Archstone's no longer on it.Search the ship for clues related to what might've happened.

I have faith in him.In the meantime, we need to hold this perimeter. Stand by, and make sure no harm befalls my fellow arch druid."
3671,"Lost In The Deeps : Pebble has gotten himself lost again, somewhere deep in the Crumbling Depths.He's fortunate that his size makes him unworthy of the effort for those gyreworms, but it's only a matter of time before he stumbles too close to one and gets eaten. Whatever he's so intent on down there is certainly not worth it.He seems to like you. Please, go and find him and bring him out of those tunnels to safer playing grounds."
3672,"Planting Season : The acorn seems to be unharmed.<Avrilla shrugs.>No point in beating around the bush. Let's plant it and see what comes out.Luckily for you, we brought some leftover soil with us to help establish our base.You'll find the soil at the graveyard directly east."
3673,Quicksilver Submersion : The troggs in Deepholm have proven to be every bit as hostile as the ones in Azeroth.  Yet perhaps their presence will prove useful to our efforts.The crates they use for trawling through the mercury will conceal you perfectly if you submerge yourself beneath the marsh.Use it to approach the Twilight's Hammer camp in the eastern end of the Upper Silvermarsh undetected.
3674,"Guardians of Hyjal: Call of the Ancients : The Guardians of Hyjal, led by Arch Druid Malfurion Stormrage, seek brave heroes to assist in defending Mount Hyjal from elemental invaders. These invaders must be repelled before forces can mobilize for a direct assault on the Firelands.Willing and able-bodied heroes should report immediately to Mount Hyjal and assist the ancient defenders: Goldrinn, Tortolla, Aviana, and Aessina.New travelers to Mount Hyjal may look for a Hero's Call to Hyjal on any Alliance board."
3675,"Druids of the Talon : Skylord Omnuron and his Druids of the Talon have been a fearsome force for us back in Hyjal. I know that they prefer the familiar skies of that battlefield, but the time may come when we need them here nonetheless.If you get your hands on enough marks, you should appeal to Omnuron that his druids should be on the main front. Omnuron watches out for his own, but he also understands the importance of this effort."
3676,"Guardians of Hyjal: Firelands Invasion! : Your work has given us the advantage we need to mobilize against the denizens of the Firelands. We are gathering our invasion force just south of our position.We could use your strength again, <race>. Speak with Matoclaw at the Sanctuary of Malorne. She is coordinating the invasion effort."
3677,"Question the Slaves : According to the orders you found, there is a key inside the tent in the southeastern end of Deathwing's Fall.Obtain it and free the slaves in the quarry to the south."

Please, <name>, work with Matoclaw to obtain enough resources to afford reinforcements. Then, we take our second and final stab at the Firelands."
3679,"Filling the Moonwell : We've constructed this moonwell, but it serves little purpose until it is filled with the sacred waters of the Well of Eternity.With an active moonwell, we would be able to bless our food stores, and we may also be able to use the blessing to offer you some protection from fire as well.When you've obtained enough marks, speak to Matoclaw at the Sanctuary of Malorne. She'll be able to secure transport of the sacred waters."
3680,"Without a Captain or Crew : Not sure who you're with, but you don't look like one of... them.I'm not sure what happened.

His insides are not where they should be.>I can keep steering the ship for a while longer.  You don't die from a gut wound immediately.  Just bring me some rope and some rum... no, whiskey."
3681,"Into Slashing Winds : <class>, I refuse to believe my Go'el is lost forever. His spirit has been scattered across the elemental planes. If even a part of him still exists, we can find him, but I will need your help.We will start with the plane of air.Speak to me and we will travel to the Vortex Pinnacle together. We must speak with an elemental, Cyclonas. He's capricious, but he sees everything in the realm of air. If my love is there, Cyclonas will know what's become of him."

3683,"The Maelstrom : Thank the spirits you're here, <name>.We're not sure how much longer we can maintain the rift in the Maelstrom.Our most powerful members, led by Thrall, are barely preventing the tear.Last I heard, our only hope was to go through the breach and attempt to stabilize it from the other side.I will conjure a portal.  Take it and report to Thrall as soon as you can."
3684,"Calling the Ancients : The ancients await in Hyjal. The Firelands will prove a dangerous place for them considering their... composition, but their strength will be of great use to us if we are to face any of Ragnaros' lieutenants.Gather your marks, and seek out Elderlimb at the Sanctuary of Malorne. If they are to march with us, he would be the one leading them through the portal."
3685,The Protectors of Hyjal : We need to place pressure on the assault camp at Sethria's Roost. Ragnaros' minions are using this area as a point to push their battlefront beyond the bounds of Hyjal. I'm putting you in charge of a small squad to deal with them.I have selected an elite group of fighters to assist you. Travel to Sethria's Roost. Your compatriots have been instructed to meet you once you arrive. Then put an end to the elementals' assault.
3686,"Glop, Son of Glop : Glop had a son. In his grave hubris, he named it Glop. And so the line of fungalmancers continues.I require you to slay this new fungalmancer. Your shaman ally has already returned, and awaits you at his cave in the southwest of Verlok Stand."

3690,"Imposing Confrontation : Have ya seen the looming giant in the distance to the northeast? Dat is Boden the Imposing, one of Therazane the Stonemother's Stone Lords.We be knowin' little of da Stone Lords, but Boden is not known ta be very level-headed. Sadly, he seems to be da one leadin' dis assault, so he's the one we must be confrontin'.Take dis proclamation to him and read it aloud on behalf of da Earthen Ring. I know it be a bit of a stretch to think words will settle dis, but we have to try. Be cautious."
3691,"A Smoke-Stained Locket : This locket has a few small leaf-shaped carvings etched into its face, but any other details have been rubbed away with time, or burned away with fire. It appears to be druidic in nature.Most druids pass through Moonglade during their training. If anybody can help you decipher where this locket came from, it would be Rabine Saturna of Nighthaven."
3692,"Additional Armaments : These druids be lackin' the tools ta properly handle the job out 'ere. I got meself a buddy back at day ol' stag shrine through the portal though. If we were ta be gettin' reunited, we'd sure have some real toys ta use against ol' Ragboy and 'is cronies.Take some of dem mark things an' go find Matoclaw. Ask her fer Ricket. We need'r here so we can be causin' some real trouble."
3693,"The Rest is History : In her memories, Leyara spoke of Malfurion. The tragedies of her past - at least, in her opinion - are largely due to his actions.Malfurion must remember Leyara from before she became a Druid of the Flame. You resolve to bring the locket to him in the Firelands. Hopefully he can answer any remaining questions."
3694,"The Shadow Wardens : The Shadow Wardens are back in the Regrowth. I know that they take the loss of Fandral from their custody very seriously, so it wouldn't take much prodding to bring them to the Firelands to hunt the Druids of the Flame, and perhaps aid us otherwise in the process.Should you come upon enough marks, you should seek out Captain Saynna Stormrunner at the Sanctuary of Malorne and secure her aid."
3695,"Some Spraining to Do : Hop on, <name>.  Let's see what Mr. Ogreface has to say for himself.Don't be shy, Stormbeak's only ever dropped a passenger a couple of times before."

3697,"The Call of the World-Shaman : The Earthen Ring calls to you once more, <name>.Thrall has cast aside his mantle as warchief of the Horde, but in his new role he needs the support of his people more than ever. He has requested one of the Horde's finest to accompany him in his next endeavor, a ritual of healing that will profoundly impact our world.You will find him under the boughs of Nordrassil in Mount Hyjal, on the southern side of the tree. Heed the call!"
3698,"Those Bears Up There : Oh, raspberries! Just when we had saved the last bear cub from the treetops, the fires returned and scared them again!I don't know if you know this, but baby bears are precious and soft.Go to the Whistling Grove, far to the northwest. Climb the trees, grab the bear cubs, and chuck them - gently! - to the soft target in the center of the grove.<Without warning, Mylune suddenly smashes you against her bosom and begins sobbing.>Lil' b-b-b-baby bears! Save them, <name>!"
3699,"The Forlorn Spire : Captain Saynna Stormrunner is launching an attack against the Forlorn Spire. If you head to the northeast, you'll find her at the bottom of the ramp leading up towards that rise.Go there and escort one of her druids to the tower with any forces that she can spare. You'll have quite a fight ahead of you - make sure the druid lives to see the end of it or they'll not be able to seize the tower."
3700,"None Left Behind : Your friend has been doing everything she can to save my crew. I'm deeply appreciative.We're still dealing with more than we can handle here: quenching the fires on the wreckage, getting my people out, fighting off these evil sea creatures, and trying to prevent the prisoners from escaping. We're simply in over our heads.I still have men on the ship that we need to get clear before the wreckage collapses on them. I know this is asking a lot, but can you help?"
3701,"The Dawning Light : It was a miracle that you were able to survive, <name>. It is with great sorrow that I have to say that Grand Master Hight was not so lucky. His spirit now rests with the ancestors.Now we must look to a new leader for our order, our broken temple. I have spoken with the other masters and we are all of one mind on this.We all agree that new leader should be you, <name>. You have shown strength, wisdom, courage, and kindness beyond measure.Walk with us to the temple and we will announce our decision."

Return to the western edge of the Pale Roost and strike the resonating crystal.I will meet you there and lend what aid I can. Put her back in her place, <class>."
3704,"The Very Earth Beneath Our Feet : Only one piece of the World Pillar remains, and it is in the hands of the Stonemother herself. Worse, the temple has come under siege by elementals and giants. It's not a terrible leap of logic to assume they're acting by her will.Go out and meet the elementals in battle to the northwest. Work with Torunscar and Norsala to find a way to communicate with their leaders and seek out the World Pillar. We would prefer such be done peacefully, but we will do whatever we must to seal the rift."
3705,"Through the Gates of Hell : There will be time to mourn for Hamuul later. His is the first of many inevitable casualties in this war.... but our attack cannot wait, nor should the momentum we have gained over the last several days be wasted.The portal atop Nordune Ridge is now open. Our reinforcements are prepared, and they await only my order to pass through the portal.We will meet again on the other side of the portal. Once there, we shall ensure that our foothold is secure."
3706,"Elemental Bonds: Doubt : I do know the one you seek... but I do not know if it is wise for you to follow him. He has cast himself into the cyclone. The winds now tear at his body and mind, leaving nothing but shreds of flesh and doubt.Chasing after him would only expose you to the same fate. The wind's edge leaves nothing uncut.You have been warned. Now what will you do?"
3707,"Return to the Temple of Earth : You must get word back to the others at the temple.  Chances are, the fragment is already getting moved to a more secure location.Tell Maruut what you know.  I'm going to do a little investigating about this Twilight Council in the meantime."
3708,"Rocket Boot Boost : You need to get those boots down into the caldera to Hobart Grapplehammer.Now that they're infused with the leftover rockin' powder, they should have enough thrust to get you all the way there on one shot.When you're ready, activate the boots. Don't worry, they're automatically set to land you safely.I think."
3709,"The Nordrassil Summit : Hello, <class>! My brothers and sisters of the Earthen Ring have spoken well of your deeds in the wake of the Cataclysm. But much remains to be done if we are to heal this broken world.Walk with me, friend. Preparations for a ceremony are underway, a ritual that I hope will be a turning point in our battle against the Twilight's Hammer.When all is done, you will be able to spread the word about our triumph here."
3710,"Into the Fire : Skylord Omnuron and his druids are seeking to push through the Furnace to our northwest. They've been able to fly over the dangers, but they really need someone on the ground to help them secure the territory past the fire... someone like you.If you want to aid the Druids of the Talon, wait for one of Omnuron's Windcallers to start pushing through the fire, stay close to him, and keep him safe from any attackers within the flames."
3711,"The World Pillar Fragment : It is time, <name>.  We have spotted Abyssion making his way to the lair.The Twilight's Hammer might've thought the fragment would be safe if a dragon guarded it, but I've met enough dragons to know their one weakness.  Pride.Abyssion's not going to run from a fight with us puny mortals.Place the banner of the Earthen Ring in the middle of his lair.  Once we defeat him, bring the fragment to Maruut.  We need to repair the World Pillar as soon as possible."
3712,"Where's Goldmine? : My goblin initiate has been gone for quite some time. His name is Goldmine.I sent him out to observe the local rock flayers southwest at the Quartzite Basin. Perhaps you would be willing to find him? When you do, please ask him to come back to the temple."
3713,"Pebble : If you hadn't noticed, there's a very small elemental that has taken a liking to you. If you stay on the ground for even a few moments, I'm sure you'll spot him.You seem to be quite adept at making friends down here. A good talent to have."
3714,"Elemental Bonds: The Vow : Before he passed through the portal to Mount Hyjal, Thrall asked you to follow him. There is something he would like you to witness."
3715,"To the Sanctuary! : We should not worry about this ""Druid of the Flame"" for the time being. We must be concerned with the continuance of our operation.Return to Matoclaw at the Sanctuary of Malorne. If Ragnaros was prepared for our arrival, then I anticipate that his forces will launch a counterattack soon."
3716,"Fire in the Skies : Look at that! It's incredible! Born less than two days ago and already full grown. Sadly, I suspect their life cycle is similarly short, so we'll have to take advantage of any time we have.His training went remarkably well. I want you to be the one to take him out and unleash him on the bulk of the enemy forces gathered near Ragnaros' keep.Show no mercy, <race>."
3717,"Take Him to the Earthcaller : He still looks a little loopy to me. His head must still be ringing.Best get him inside the temple and see what the Earthcaller wants to do with him.I think I'm going to stay out here a little while longer and ""observe"" these rock flayers."
3718,"Rallying the Earthen Ring : We must be rallyin' da Earthen Ring for dis fight. What we be lackin' in numbers, we make up for in strength.Go to tha temple and gather da restin' shaman from tha rear rooms. Norsala, Lorvarius, and I will be meetin' them at Lorthuna's Gate."
3719,"Hero's Call: Deepholm! : By order of his royal highness, King Anduin Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Naraat the Earthspeaker at the Eastern Earthshrine in Stormwind City.The Earthen Ring requires our aid! They report that the elemental plane of Deepholm threatens to overtake our world and destroy all life on Azeroth!The Eastern Earthshrine can be found directly northwest of Stormwind Keep.For the glory and honor of the Alliance! Fight on, <brother/sister>!"
3720,"One With the Ground : The leader of the Stone Mother's forces here is the great earth elemental lord, Avalanchion. Luckily for us, the Twilight's Hammer cultists have decided to invade his lair. They're seeking to bind his elementals to their will.We will take advantage of the chaos. The earth ritual that I invoke will make you one with the ground. It will take you near to Avalanchion without alerting him to your presence.It's up to you to finish him."
3721,"A Ritual of Flame : We appear to have everything under control. Our invasion portal to the Firelands will be opened momentarily, and the elementals have not put up much fight.Assist our druids by dispatching the last few of these elementals. Then, once the gate has been opened, we can make our move."
3722,"Leyara : Before we depart, <name>, I have another matter to which you should attend.A Druid of the Flame has been spotted in the ruins to the northwest. I suspect it is the same one that attacked us at the portal several days ago. Now would be an ideal time to see what it is that she truly wants... and if necessary, dispose of her.See to this flame druid, then we can continue on our planned course."
3723,"Fight Fire and Water and Air with... : Did you hear the man going on with his incessant yelling while you were up there? That's Haethen Kaul, their leader.It's a well known fact that he's gone insane from the power he's drawing from their bound elementals. Unfortunately, it makes him nigh invincible.If you're to fight him, you'll first have to kill each of the elementals, gaining their wards in the process. That should protect you from Haethen's magic.Well, most of it anyway."
3724,"Deepholm, Realm of Earth : I knew you'd heed our call, <name>.  When Deathwing was first defeated by the other dragon aspects, he retreated to Deepholm, the realm of earth.Deathwing's return to our world left a rift open between Azeroth and Deepholm.If we don't mend the breach, this land will be torn asunder.We're doing our best to contain the damage on this side of the rift.  Aggra will take you through the rift so you can help repair the damage from the other side.Get on her wyvern when you're ready."
3725,"The Explorers : We have a contingent of the Explorers' League in the chamber just to the northwest inside the temple.They've been making increasing noises about something that the Twilight's Hammer is up to.<name>, would you be a dear and see what they need?"
3726,"The Way of the Tushui : It's a pleasure to meet you, <class>. I am Aysa, of the Tushui.I've spent much time in thought since Master Shang told me we would be searching for Huo, the spirit of fire. I know where he resides, but not how to reach him. The answers are close, however.Come with me to the Cave of Meditation nearby. It is a place of great wisdom. I will meditate there, open my mind, and the path shall find us."
3727,Undying Twilight : The Twilight Cultists are here! They're trying to stop the ritual! Get to the back chambers and help fight them off!
3728,"Elemental Bonds: Fury : The totems, <name>! We need to activate them, or Go'el is lost!Kill the elementals next to each of my totems, located around the edges of this plateau. Once all four totems are activated, we should be able to free the last piece of Go'el's soul!"
3729,Wrath of the Fungalmancer : Their leader hides within his hole ahead. He is the one that has brought the plague upon the crimson expanse.He must be killed.One of your Earthen Ring companions is already inside. You should speak with her.
3730,"Sealing the Way : The stone troggs have found a way to burrow up from underneath our homes!I've sent our geomancers to seal all of the buildings, but they need these reagents and enough time out of battle to properly cast their rockslide rituals.When you're done, report to, Gravel Longslab, just to the north on the Fractured Front."
3731,"Underground Economy : Hey! I need some help gatherin' crystals. The elementals trade top dollar for these things... if you help me gather all the different kinds, I'll cut you in on the profits.Use these bombs to blow out chunks from the bigger formations.I've got a nasty habit of packin' the explosives a bit thick. Mind the kick."
3732,"Stonefather's Boon : With the Stonefather taken prisoner, our forces are demoralized. Normally any one of mine could take five times his number of stone troggs. But now....I want you to head out into the field surrounding the town. Plant Stonefather Oremantle's banner near my defenders. Grant them his boon and remind them of that for which they fight."
3733,"Strike at the Heart : One of Ragnaros' Lieutenants has shown himself at Ragnaros' Reach, the walled area to our northeast.I hoped to send you as soon as you returned, but I suspect Witherbranch and some of our forces have already joined the fight by now. You should hurry.You should be able to drop down the cliff wall right here and reach them quickly."
3734,"Crumbling Defenses : When da attack started, we pushed out to take da field as quickly as we could. Dere forces were deep and endless... we underestimated dem. Now some of our best shaman be stranded out dere, exhausted, far from our defenses.Make your way out and take da pressure off of our stranded brothas. Even a small break in battle be a chance to get much needed room ta breathe.Be swift, <class>."
3735,"Between the Trees : Spirit fragments of Malorne - seen to us mortals as ghostly white deer - still frolic through these forests. While Malorne is no longer with us, these pieces of his spirit may be of use to us.Travel east and walk among the trees. If you are able to get close enough to one of the spirit fragments, it will bestow its power to you.Oh, and take this staff. You may need it later."
3736,"Call the Flock : Today, we have an opportunity to make another assault against one of Ragnaros' greater minions: Millagazor. However, we first need to get some assistance.<Matoclaw holds up a large, silky feather.>Use this artifact to invoke the power of Aviana. Once you have done so, travel northwest and gather some of her flock by calling out to them.Once you have done so, we may proceed against Millagazor."
3737,"Well Armed : Ricket should be at Malfurion's Breach with Damek, as you requested. I'm not sure you fully know what you're getting into with those two though.Speaking of which, you should probably go check on them... make sure they haven't managed to blow up the Sentinel Tree itself. As long as you keep them busy with the elementals, the chances of ""accidents"" at the breach should lessen dramatically."
3738,"Perfecting Your Howl : The wolf ancient, Lo'gosh - or, if you prefer, Goldrinn - has many weapons available to him, but always the most underestimated is his howl. Today, we will use this weapon to summon and defeat Lylagar, one of the lieutenants of flame that lurk within the Firelands.Defeat any of the creatures of flame within the Regrowth, and then use the Fang of the Wolf while standing atop their corpse. Soon, your howl will echo across all of Kalimdor."
3739,"The Disciple's Challenge : <name>, I see great strength and great courage in you, and an unsurpassed purity of soul.The hour is young, but I think you may be ready to face a greater challenge.Go to the bottom of the stairs, and cross the bridge. There, you will find Jaomin Ro, one of our eldest students. Challenge and defeat him in honorable combat, and this first phase of your training will be complete."
3740,"To Stonehearth's Aid : The earthen and the stone troggs somehow found their way to Deepholm through Uldum more than fifteen thousand years ago. They've been warring ever since.If we're to recover the middle fragment of the World Pillar, the Stonefather must be rescued.Please go to Stonehearth and do everything that you can to aid the Earthen in their war against the stone troggs.You're our best hope, <name>."
3741,"The Reliquary : We have a contingent of the Reliquary in the chamber just to the northeast inside the temple.They've been making increasing noises about something that the Twilight's Hammer is up to.<name>, would you be a dear and see what they need?"
3742,"The Lesson of the Burning Scroll : Every wisdom has a time and place, and times are changing for those of us living here on Shen-zin Su. For this lesson, I would ask two things of you.For the first, I hold a flame in my hand. Gather your wits, and when you think you are ready, attempt to snatch the flame.Should you succeed, I want you to then climb to the top of this temple and burn the Edict of Temperance that you find there."
3743,"Victory! : We just can't thank you enough for all that you've done. Now we can all get off of this island before it kills us!Thrall is going to want to speak with you first, <name>. I'll rocket you over there.See you on the ship!"
3744,"Something that Burns : Alright, we need something that's going to make the compound go, ""Boom""!I'm all out of gun powder, but I think I know what we can use instead... the heart of my fire elemental!Here, take my fire totem east to the Blood Trail. Just flip the switch on it near any of the lava pools over there and Magmatooth should be summoned. Bring back his heart and we'll be in business."
3745,"Depth of the Depths : <The ground trembles slightly, and the low, familiar voice of Diamant speaks as if from the stone itself.>Well done, <race>.Within the tunnels below, you will find the stone which you seek. Painite.The dangers ahead are many...Dangers that the Stone Lords themselves fear.Remain steady.Remain strong.The strength of the rock itself is beneath your feet."
3746,"The Warden : We have almost finished clearing out the revolting prisoners in the hole, but one last problem remains.  The warden.Warden Silva is their master and they will do anything for him.  If we take him out, we take them all out.  Finish him off and bring me back his keys.  We can use those keys to explore deeper into the cellblock and possibly gain access to the water supply here on the island."
3747,"Diplomacy First : The Earthen Ring is a neutral organization, <name>.  We cannot pick sides in the war between the Horde and the Alliance.Look around you -- our members come from all backgrounds.  Our mission would be compromised should racial tensions be put above our goal.  Let's try to keep this under wraps until we have more information.We must not jump to conclusions just yet.  I'll send you and one of our new members to look for the Alliance gunship.Find out what you can without dragging us into the conflict."
3748,"The Stone Throne : I am returning to my throne. I've no desire to see any more of these Earthen Ring, but you remain welcome here, <race>. If you wish to help us rebuild our realm, perhaps we can help you in return.All things in time."
3749,"Throw It On the Ground! : This nightmare will never be over while Blastshadow the Brutemaster still breathes. There are a couple of problems though.One, being a warlock, he's got a succubus named Delicia Whipsnaps. If you kill Blastshadow quickly, the demon will go back to where it was summoned from.The second problem, since Blastshadow is a warlock, he has a soulstone that allows him to resurrect. You have to get his soulstone and destroy it so that he'll be dead forever!"
3750,"Nature's Blessing : <Mylune's voice rings in your head, like the sound of birds chirping.>I love all creatures of the forest, even spiders, despite the fact that they are icky. But the spiders from the Firelands are worse than icky. They're burny, and don't belong here.Find the fire portal in the western Regrowth, and use the gem I gave you earlier to force it open. When a fire spider emerges, step on it! Unless it's big. Then, do something <class>y to it.Oh, and use the gem if spider venom makes you woozy!"
3751,"Beneath the Surface : Among the other precious gemstones hidden deep out of our reach in the Crumbling Depths, there are enormous ruby crystal clusters. They are infused with terrible energy.It will not be easy to obtain such a thing, for they are well guarded. But you, you are stubborn and brave. I think this is something you can do.Within the Crumbling Depths, look to where the tunnels end abruptly in stone. The clusters are found in those passages when they are to be found at all. Should you find one, return to me."
3752,The Binding : A noise in the main chamber of the temple draws your attention. You hear a familiar laugh... Lorthuna. She's returned to interrupt the ritual - you must stop her!
3753,"An Ancient Evil : <name>, I was looking for you!One of the escaping sailors just spotted Aysa in the wreckage of the ship, facing some enormous beast. She might need your help - you should go to her, quickly!"
3754,"The Pride of Kezan : This is ridiculous! Those gnomes just don't know when to stop!Goblin pride is on the line here! <name>, you gotta jump into the Pride of Kezan and show them what's what!Let me know when you're ready!"
3755,"Thunder Stones : To the north lies the Fractured Front. That is where most of the heavy fighting is happening.Go into Stonehearth proper and grab all of the thunder stones that you can. Our engineers need them for the catapults.When you have enough, take them to Clay Mudaxle. Don't mind his tongue. He's old and cranky, and should have gone back into the earth thousands of years ago."
3756,"Shu, the Spirit of Water : Shu, the spirit of water, is sulking in the deep pool to the north. Cross the rocks and then drop the sun pearl in the center of the pool. He will know what this means."
3757,"Surrender or Else! : <name>, you and Ace need to march those naga hatchlings down there and use them as leverage to convince the leader of the naga to surrender to us.Ace knows where to go on the south side of the ruins... just follow him."
3758,"Wings Aflame : <Matoclaw's voice continues to echo within your head.>Millagazor is a creature of flame, but in many ways, he is not unlike the birds of this land. As such, Aviana's artifacts may still have the power to summon him.The fiery portal to the west is where you will find him. Use the quill near the portal's entrance, then prepare for a fierce battle."
3759,Deathwing's Fall : The Twilight's Hammer involvement in the disappearance of the World Pillar fragment makes complete sense.  Let us hope that we can act swiftly enough to recover it.<Maruut places his hand on your shoulder.>I've established a spiritual bond with you.  We should be able to communicate while you remain in Deepholm.Go to Deathwing's Fall to the southeast and investigate the Twilight's Hammer operation there.
3760,"Corruption Destruction : If this disgusting growth is truly brought on by the Verlok, then their supplies will be in their village to the north. Bring them to me so that I can verify your claims."
3761,"The Wardens are Watching : We must tread carefully, <class>. Fandral's Druids of the Flame practice their fiery magic beyond the pillars to the north.I need you to capture one of those druids alive for questioning. We must seize every opportunity to learn of their plans.One of my wardens will accompany you. Follow her instructions if you wish to survive."
3762,"The Biggest Egg Ever : Bamm Megabomb? Who does he think he is? His spiny raptor eggs are no match for what we are about to recover!As you well know, each Town-In-A-Box is equipped with a micro mechachicken for just such a dietary emergency. Luckily for us, my keen intellect was able to deduce the location that our prodigious, pre-programmed poultry ran off to.Head north to the Scorched Gully. But beware, its circuit boards are fried and I imagine it's not so micro any longer!"
3763,"Caught Unawares : Our invasion plan looks to have backfired. Several of our birds have already reported in, speaking of fires breaking out across the vales of central Hyjal.Now, many of our druids are stranded out in the field, unprepared for such a large-scale attack. Thisalee was near Ashen Lake, and several others were out in the Regrowth, to the northeast.Go, <name>! Find them, and make sure that they do not succumb to this backdraft!"
3764,"A Goblin in Shark's Clothing : Combining the remains of the Mechachicken with these shark parts, we've assembled the greatest fighting submersible of all time: the Mechashark X-Steam!Hobart and I want you to pilot it, <name>. Go west to the water and activate the Mechashark X-Steam Controller.You must kill The Hammer if we're to have any hope of exploiting the natural resources of the Dire Strait to their fullest extent. It's for the good of the cartel!"
3765,Clingy : <A miniscule elemental seems to have taken a liking to you.>Caris... carstr... crystal? <Pebble looks up at you expectantly.><You did notice a very large crystal formation towards the middle of the Shuddering Spires. Perhaps you should take him there?>
3766,"A New Fate : These new allies have shed light on a great and important truth: it is not just Shen-zin Su that is ailing, but all of the land beyond the clouds. The world needs healing, and I think that you should be the ones to heal it.I would like you, Ji, and Aysa to leave and bring your strength and wisdom to the world. These Alliance and Horde have different ideals, but at the core of both lies noble intent.I will leave the choice of who you wish to accompany to you."
3767,"A Bitter Pill : As far as I'm concerned, there's no problem that can't be solved with bombs. And if a bomb doesn't solve your problem on the first try... use a bigger bomb.So there's this big worm that's been eating people near the lava pools up north. Search for breath bubbles to find it. Attack it until it prepares to bite, then place this bomb down in front of it. Then sit back and watch the fireworks.Hmm... there was one other thing I wanted to say... oh yeah! Don't get eaten."
3768,A New Friend : He wants you to play with him. Go for it!
3769,"At the Stonemother's Call : It is time. The Stonemother will speak with you. You can find her throne in northern Deepholm, above the Scoured Reach."
3770,Morale Boost : You've got to get all the Kaja'Cola Zero-One that you can and make the goblins drink it to boost their morale and free them!
3771,"All Our Friends Are Dead : Something's wrong here, <name>.The ship's crew has been slain.  Yet there is no bloodshed or damage to the ship's structure.This was not the Horde's doing.We will find the answers we seek by speaking to the spirits of the dead.  They have not yet left this world.Take this totem and place it near the corpses of the fallen.  You will have a few seconds to listen to their last few thoughts.Beware, however!  There is no telling how the spirits of the dead will react to our prodding."
3772,"The Harder They Fall : Molten Behemoths have joined the elementals upon the battlefield. They are crushing our front lines. I need you to halt their momentum.You'll find the beasts slow and clumsy. They can easily be outmaneuvered, but they will pack a devastating punch if they hit you. Be nimble, <class>."
3773,"On Second Thought, Take One Prisoner : It's not too late, <name>.  The cultists are probably still here.Go below decks, find out who's in charge and subdue them.We will obtain answers to our questions, one way or another."
3774,"A Slight Problem : While you were out there, Pyrium Lodestone contacted me. He said that there is a matter of great urgency and that your assistance is needed immediately. Return to him at the entrance to Needlerock Slag to the southwest.I wish you luck with the rescue of the Stonefather and the recovery of the middle fragment."
3775,"Victory in Tol Barad : Maintaining control of Tol Barad is the key to our strategic plans here in the Eastern Kingdoms, <race>.  We must do whatever it takes to keep the Alliance off this island and that means we need your help.  Fight with everything you have to win control of Tol Barad and bring me word of victory."
3776,"Stronger Than Stone : Gather me stone blocks from the Ridge of Laughing Winds to the south.You have seen my strength twice, yet I still spy doubt within your eyes. It will not last."
3777,"The Lesson of the Iron Bough : First, you will need weapons suited to your talents. Retrieve a spellblade and a hand fan from one of the weapon racks below, bring it to me, and show me that you know how to hold it properly."
3778,"A Shady Character : Your followers tell of a smuggler of wit and guile, who was able to charm them with stories of lands far and wide.  Though it cost a fair sum to retrieve, they managed to obtain a token which when displayed to the smuggler, will allow the bearer to purchase his wares."
3779,"Unwelcome Nature : You faced forest sprites in the Dawning Valley, but the forest sprites in this grove are a different breed. Crueler and more dangerous.If you would clear some of these sprites out, the spirits would thank you."
3780,"Some Like It Hot : I've been making progress in my research, <name>. Based on what we've witnessed in the local flora, it's quite possible that your Lasher also accepts superheated liquids as a principal source of nutrition.I'd like you to help me with a little experiment. The Emberspit Scorpions that inhabit the Magma Springs to the north spew out burning pools of fire during combat.Take the Lasher and observe his reaction to the scorpions' Ember Pools."
3781,"What Kind of Name is Candy, Anyway? : Can you believe that Candy Cane! You know up until you ""dealt"" with Chip, she was dating him. Now she's going out with the Trade Prince!I just can't get over the fact that she betrayed you like that with your ex. Maybe you should head down into the Slave Pits and take care of her once and for all?"
3782,"Fungal Fury : Something upon the Crimson Expanse continues to spur disgusting growths upon the rock. New fungi are rising, and they need to be crushed before they can spread."
3783,"Supplies for the Other Side : One of the biggest dangers that our druids face when fighting within the Firelands is simple dehydration. Our proveditors spend a significant amount of time preparing canteens for the troops on the other side. We do have other methods, however.In the greener thickets to the east, you should still find some blueroot vines which have not yet burned. These plants hold a tremendous amount of water in their roots - and also provide some energy for the weary soldier."
3784,"Core of Our Troubles : Elementals are chaotic by nature, but dis kind of organized aggression is out of character. More so down here where dere deaths be a bit more permanent. I suspect dis is Therazane the Stonemother's doin', but I have to be sure.Destroy da Irestone Rumblers and bring me their cores. We'll be settlin' here and now if dis is da Stonemother's hatred brought down on us."
3785,"Abyssion's Minions : If it's the dragon that's got the fragment, we're going to need to draw his attention back to his den.Go to Abyssion's Lair just east of here and defeat his underlings.  That should get him to show up with the World Pillar fragment sooner or later."
3786,"What Kind of Name is Chip, Anyway? : Dude! You're never going to guess who's out on the oil platform to the north.<Ace shakes head in disbelief.>Chip's out there, and he's working for the Trade Prince. That traitor's now working for the other team. But worse, I heard he's going out with your ex-girlfriend, Candy Cane!I don't know about you, but if he was going out with my ex, I'd do something about it."
3787,"Fungal Monstrosities : Grab yourself a war guardian, and destroy those fungal monstrosities while you're out there."
3788,"Still Good! : The virmen to the south have been running off with all of our crops, but they're taking more than they can eat. They must be stockpiling them somewhere - the ones they like anyway.Will you go out and recover any of the uprooted crops you can find? I've got an island's worth of people to feed, and every single vegetable makes a difference."
3789,"The Spirit and Body of Shen-zin Su : Well, that wraps it up here, doesn't it <name>?  Now that we've got these two roused and all friendly towards you, we just need to get them back to the Temple of Five Dawns.You go ahead. I'm going to say my goodbyes, then I'll follow you up shortly."
3790,"Only the Worthy Shall Pass : It is time for you to face me. With these three fires illuminating your potential, we will see with certainty whether your resolved soul is truly worthy of passing."
3791,"A Head Full of Wind : I'm no druid, but some of these mushrooms do not look to be naturally occurring. I know that our Stone Lord friend over there is eager to blame this on exposure to Azeroth, but I suspect more domestic causes.I saw some clouds of red mist to the northeast, near the water's edge. They seemed to be spurring new growth in their wake. Take one of my wind-devils with you and get me a sample from those clouds. You may have to stay close to the ground to spot them."
3792,"Rescue the Stonefather... and Flint : We found out where the Stonefather is being held and young Flint ran off on his own to rescue him!I don't have to tell you that this is bad. Flint is going to get himself captured as well, or worse!The stone trogg chieftain, Bouldergut, is at the end of the ledges above Needlerock Chasm to the north.Please, <name>, you must go after Flint and free the Stonefather before we lose them both!"
3793,"Walk A Mile In Their Shoes : We have sent at least 3 different recon groups to investigate Farson Hold in the last few weeks.  Sadly, not one of them has returned back with any info.At this point, all we can hope is that they are being held alive as prisoners.  I need you to infiltrate the keep and help get our soldiers back.  This won't be easy <name>, but if anyone can help us, it's you."
3794,"Naga Hide : It's oft whispered in dark corners of a material so fine, so exquisite to the touch, that goblins of sophisticated taste will spend any amount of moolah to get their hands on some.Of course, I'm speaking of naga hide!<Brett looks around to make sure no one else is listening in.>I know that you're going to head down there and that it's inevitable that you're going to have to fight those snakes. Hey, they're not going to have a use for their hides anyway. They'll be dead!"
3795,"Steady Hand : Nearby to the north, you will find Terrath the Steady. He has taken upon the task of pulling the stone dragons back into the fold. We find ourselves repeating this trial every few hundred years... the stone dragons are fickle, and bend only to strength.Terrath is balanced and reasonable, but his goals may not be easily accomplished. Go to him. Appeal to the more balanced side of the Stonemother."
3796,"Three Little Pygmies : Look, I think it's great that we're destroying all of these zombies, even though they're our friends and family. But don't you think we should be taking care of the pygmies that are creating them as well?At the three Oostan villages, Nord, Sor, and Ost, there are witch doctors: Gaahl, Malmo, and Teloch.Maybe you could take care of them? I don't want to be turned into a zombie!"
3797,"Down Into the Chasm : Down below in Needlerock Chasm is where the mystics are sprouting all of these fungal monstrosities. I sent Slate Quicksand and a small force to deal with it, but they've run into a snag.You remember the Arch Geomancer? Would you fly down there to the northeast and lend him a hand?"
3798,"Block the Gates : If we're to have a shot against Abyssion, we must make sure he receives no aid from reinforcements.You will find two gateways in his lair to the east.  Use this stormstone to disrupt their operation.If everything goes as planned, we'll be able to tackle Abyssion without him being able to receive much assistance."
3799,"The Twilight Plot : We came here to investigate rumors of a Titan artifact up at the Masters' Gate to the southwest.One of those Twilight's Hammer cultists must have the plans for what they're doing up there. You're going to have to get them for us, <name>.Keep searching the cultists until you find them."
3800,"The Call of the Pack : <Matoclaw continues:>The easternmost portal of flame is the domain of Lylagar. Stand before the portal, deliver a challenging howl, and then force the fiery beast to submit."
3801,"Dafeng, the Spirit of Air : If you listen long enough, the wind will carry the answer to you.Dafeng, the spirit of air, has been scared from the skies by Zhao-Ren, the Onyx Serpent. He hides within the Chamber of Whispers, at the south side of the plateau.Go to him. Ji and I will join you there."
3802,"Rush Delivery : Peak Grindstone's team broke down somewhere out there to the west.Think you can make yourself useful for a change and rush some parts out to them, <race>?"
3803,"Starting Young : Our scouts are bringing back reports of fire hawk hatchlings all over the peak... their eggs must have hatched very recently. Better yet, it seems that they're extremely docile.I know it may sound a strange and perhaps unsavory request, but if you were able to bring some of those hatchlings back to me, I might be able to train them to aid us in our war efforts.Are you willing?"
3804,"Huo, the Spirit of Fire : You are worthy of passing, <class>.Huo, the spirit of fire rests in the chamber beyond. Let him feast upon the kindling you've gathered, and use the wind to fan his flames. Doing so should endear you to him. Once he is ignited, if he is willing, lead him to the Temple of Five Dawns, the building standing high in the center of the island."
3805,"Decryption Made Easy : We don't have the tools to decipher these encrypted plans. The Twilight's Hammer do, though.Would you take the plans back up there and run them through their one-time decryption engines?"
3806,"Passing Wisdom : This journey shall soon be yours to undertake without me. Stay for a few moments and listen to an old man's words. Let my knowledge serve as a foundation for yours, that you might be greater than I ever was."
3807,"She Loves Me, She Loves Me NOT! : Oh, sweetie! You're never going to guess who's down in the slave pits to the north.<Sassy shakes her head sadly at you.>Candy's down there, and she's working for the Trade Prince. She dropped you like a bad habit and now she's working for the other team. but it gets worse. Since you ""dealt"" with Chip, she's dating the Trade Prince!I don't know about you, but if she were my ex, I'd rip her fickle heart right out of her chest."
3808,Testing the Trap : You must set the trap for the matriarch now.Go to the western end of the Alabaster Shelf and place the trapped basilisk meat in the center of the feeding grounds.
3809,Elemental Energy : It's taking every ounce of our power to keep this realm stable in the absence of the World Pillar.As shaman we can tap directly into the energies of the elementals that inhabit Deepholm and use them to heal the damage that the rift is causing.Take this totem and place it on the ground outside.  Any energized geodes or lodestone elementals destroyed in its proximity will fill it with the energy we require.
3810,"Into Constant Earth : Time is short! My love lies in Deepholm. I will take us there when you are ready, and we will speak with Therazane the Stonemother."
3811,"Morning Breeze Village : The fourth and final spirit is Dafeng, the spirit of air. When he is not in the skies, he can be found on the Ridge of Laughing Winds to the west. I've sent both Aysa and Ji to help you find him.When you are ready, I will summon winds to carry you to the top of the temple. From there, cross the bridges to the west and find Ji in Morning Breeze Village."
3812,"Resonating Blow : On the western edge of the Pale Roost, you will find a resonating crystal. Strike it with the mallet and the broodmother will come.Be ready for battle. I will be there to aid you, but she will not be easily overcome."
3813,"The Bigger They Are : You're not going to take on fiery behemoths wearing THAT, are you? If you aren't wearing my obsidium crafted goods, you're going to burn right up! And even if you are, you can never have enough of the good stuff.Look <brother/sister>, I can craft you the best armor that gold can buy, but I need pure, unsmelted Living Obsidium first.The Obsidium Punishers on Fireplume Peak are literally made of the stuff. Go kill them and gather their pieces."
3814,The Axe of Earthly Sundering : The emerald colossi are the greatest of the Stone Mother's creatures. They must be the first to be removed from the field.I brought Stonefather Oremantle's axe for just this task. Use it to sunder the giants.That should bring them down to a more manageable size for you to finish off.
3815,"Solar Core Destruction : The fight has taken us to Fandral's doorstep. His druids are channeling energies of the Firelands into a vessel called the Solar Core.Should this vessel detonate on Azeroth, none of us will have a home to return to.We need to strike at the Solar Core now, while it is still vulnerable. You can find the infernal device to the northeast."
3816,"Rocky Relations : <Norsala reaches to the ground in an attempt to discern Diamant's location, but jumps back in shock after a moment's contact.>My! Dat was unexpected. Diamant ain't far at all. When I reached out ta him, he spoke back wit me and told me where we could be finin' him. Head towards tha northeastern edge of the Jagged Wastes - Diamant will be expectin' ya.<name>, be careful. It may be unlike an earth bein' to lay an ambush, but it was unlike dem to siege the temple in da first place."
3817,Bring Down the Avalanche : You have to go back and slay Avalanchion to keep Therazane's forces from attacking Stonehearth!
3818,"Enduring the Heat : Shalis has gone with one of our druids to stop a Druid of the Flame that is performing a summoning ritual in the Igneous Depths, below us. They have been tasked with killing the druid, but I need you to stop the ritual.You'll find the entrance to the cavern east of the Magma Springs. Once inside, you'll see 8 blue runes spread throughout the cavern. You can use these runes to protect you from the fiery creatures, but you need to stamp all of them out to end the ritual. You will need to be swift."
3819,"Take No Prisoners : It looks like the Twilight's Hammer's still on the ship.  Go below decks and take them out.Be careful, <name>.  I've a feeling they're not here for a spiritual retreat, if you know what I mean."
3820,"Therazane's Mercy : There are two leaders among the Twilight that need to be killed.One is a human by the name of Boldrich. Small, as you are. But still dangerous, as you also are.The other is a priestess by the name of Lorthuna. She is wily and hard to corner. Strike swiftly and do not let her escape, or I promise you, you will regret it later."
3821,"Twilight Research : The book you found appears to detail some form of research carried out by a member of the Twilight's Hammer.It deals with the oozes in some way, but there are multiple pages missing.Perhaps if you found additional notes you might be able to make sense of it."
3822,"Living Obsidium : Have you seen those fireballs falling out of the sky? I saw one crash in the fields to the north, and the rock that landed was made of pure Living Obsidium!I can use the material to craft ultra-sturdy heat proof armor and weapons for our troops. Can you bring me a lode?Go to the Magma Springs and touch one of the magnetic stones. Just watch where you're standing when the rain of fire hits, and gather up the rocks before they crumble from the impact."
3823,"Miner Troubles : Smart mining monkeys!They're all over the inside of the cavern, mining... with picks! It's just not natural and I'm sure it's because of the kaja'mite!None of my miners have come back out. I don't have many left! You can see my predicament, <name>.<The foreman lowers his voice.>These guys are nowhere near as good as my old group of jungle trolls. Ah, those were the days.Maybe you can escort my last miner here through the cavern and keep those monkeys off of him? We need that kaja'mite!"
3824,"Bilgewater Cartel Represent : Looks like the naga down there in the ruins are preparing to invade our Town-In-A-Box. I have lots of dead scouts here as proof.I don't know about you, but I'm not about to let them try. Let's get the jump on them!Could you lay the foundation for our new coastal holdings by replacing their banners with our own? That's some prime real estate down there!"
3825,"The Singing Pools : It is crucial that we bring all of the three remaining spirits back safely. I am too old to do this myself, and for all their strengths, both Aysa and Ji are single-minded in their ideals.You possess all the qualities of a hero, and a balance that they do not. It is you that must do this.Shu, the spirit of water is somewhere in the singing pools to the east. Find Aysa there and work with her to locate him. We are all depending on you."
3826,"Blood of the Earthwarder : When Deathwing escaped to Deepholm, his corruption was extreme, but perhaps not yet absolute.The cultists at Deathwing's Fall harvest and shape the corrupted blood he left behind into living organisms to draw from their power.What if a trace of the Earthwarder's essence remains?  After all, Neltharion was the aspect of earth before he was the aspect of death.Gather samples from the living blood the cultists have created and we'll see if any trace of the Earthwarder remains."
3827,"The Tipping Point : On the day when Leyara attacked Hamuul, she was waiting near some ruins in Hyjal, northwest of the Regrowth. She acted strangely at the time: calm, silent, and staring off into the distance. Perhaps that location is of some importance to her.The locket might react if brought to that location."
3828,"Audience with the Stonemother : Stay where you are, champion. I have not yet decided what to do with you or your Earthen Ring."
3829,"Silvermarsh Rendezvous : Excellent work, <name>.  We know exactly where the meeting location is.The Upper Silvermarsh is a mercury swamp to the east of here.  It's normally only inhabited by elementals and occasional stone troggs, but our scouts have seen some Twilight activity in the region.Make your way there and let's find a way to eavesdrop on the Forgemaster's meeting."
3830,"Elemental Ore : You're going to have to deal with the leader of Therazane's forces here. However, to get you to him quickly and safely, I'm going to need to perform a ritual.Go out into the field and collect elemental ore from the ragers. With enough of it, I should be able to make you one with the ground to get you where you need to go."
3831,"The Mysterious Seed : A small, dried acorn has fallen out of the Flame Druid's robe.Why would a Druid of the Flame be carrying it around?Perhaps someone at Malfurion's Breach would like to see it."
3832,"Troggzor the Earthinator : You have to put an end to this now!Go back northwest onto the front and kill their battle leader, Troggzor the Earthinator. Bring me his cudgel as proof."
3833,"So Big, So Round... : <Pebble looks around, excited by something. After a few seconds of confusion, he stops and stares up at you with big, glowy gem eyes.>Hug-nery... hungry...<Try as you might, there's no resisting those eyes. Maybe Kor knows what mini-mentals like to eat?>"
3834,"Tragedy and Family : You were insightful to bring this locket to me, <name>. I am among the few who know where Valstann's body lays.You can find his resting site in a small graveyard, southeast of Astranaar, in Ashenvale. Bring this locket to the site, and it may unlock more memories.Farewell, <name>, and good luck on your journey."
3835,Wild Mine Cart Ride : All you have to do is jump in and speak with Assistant Greely when you get to the bottom.
3836,"We're Surrounded : Our war has been waged for longer than your kind counts time. Let us see if you can make a difference, <race>.The stone troggs are a mistake of the titans. On your world they have succumbed to the Curse of Flesh. But here, in Deepholm, you see them in their true form.We're surrounded. Maybe you could go out there and break a few troggs down for us. See what they're really made of?"
3837,"Final Confrontation : <name>, this is it! Thrall's down at the Gallywix Docks fighting the Trade Prince right now!You gotta jump into your Ultimate Footbomb Uniform and get over there!"
3838,"How Hot : The fire hawks of Fireplume Peak can withstand incredible temperatures. While you'll often find them circling the skies above, they're also known to swim in molten lava.Isn't that right, Anren?We'd like to know just how hot that lava can get. Fireplume Peak has three large lava pools. Use this to measure the temperature of each."
3839,"Shark Tank : I hate sharks.  All of my troops hate sharks too.  This is where you come in, <name>.I need you to head up to the Cape of Lost Hope and take out a huge shark named Tank.  Tank is not to be trifled with so I would bring a few friends if I were you."
3840,
3841,"Rewritten Wisdoms : <name>, we must help Elder Shaopai. There are few more deserving of our kindness.On the way here, you surely noticed the scrolls of wisdom hanging in the grotto to the south. The hozen have defiled many of them, and sadly, they are not recoverable. We will deal with the problem directly - burn the defiled scrolls. Wipe the hozen writings away entirely.Do not worry for Elder Shaopai. The people shall come together and help him rewrite the wisdoms in time. I shall see to that."
3842,"Invasion Imminent! : Your work here is done for now, but there's no rest for the wicked, eh?You remember Megs Dreadshredder, our old marketing rep? She's taken some others over the hills to the southeast, just past the Raptor Rise. If you follow the path east out of town and follow it south at the fork, you can't miss her.Apparently there's some trouble or other brewing with the snake-men at the ruins on the shore. Go see if you can't sort it all out, would you?"
3843,"Nourishing Waters : I have dispatched the sacred moonwell waters to Malfurion's Breach, as you requested. Ayla is well trained in tending to them. You should return to her and see the boons she weaves for you there."
3844,Unsolid Ground : The Twilight Cult are mining jade crystals near their camp.Foolish...Reckless...Gather the mined crystals. Take them to the center of their camp. Shatter them against the ground.The reverberations and the powered crystal will bring the tunnelers upon them.They will learn respect for the earth...Piece by piece...Rock by rock......with time.
3845,"Fly Over : I tried ta fly o'er the terrace an have a look fer myself, but those toastie eatin' pansies kept shootin' at me, an I couldn't get near.Ya look like ya might be handy with the reins. Why don' ya take yer flyin' beastie up there ta the southwest and see what all the fuss is about?"
3846,"Warn the Rebel Camp : Dis death ain't be in vain, <name>.  We figure out dat Kilnara be on da prowl.  Tings don't look good.We better check out da Rebel Camp to da north.  Maybe we find my contact dere."
3847,"The Heads of the SI:7 : These orcs were murdered in cold-blood by the Alliance down on the coast. We did nothing to provoke them.Their deaths should not be in vain, <name>. Will you bring them justice?<Aggra appears as if she can barely contain her rage.>There are three SI:7 leaders down there along the beach. Bring me each of their heads."
3848,"The Slave Pits : Sassy's over at the Slave Pits. She's there with the orcs getting ready to execute the final play on the Trade Prince.<name>, take the footbomb uniform up the road to the southwest and find her. I know she's going to want you to lead the charge!Ack, I'm starting to talk like the coach now!"
3849,"Life of the Party : Oh my gosh, babe! Everyone is here! Who cares about some stupid dragon?We setup the party around the pool. Sounds like they're having a great time. You are going to look so good!Why don't you head over to the pool and keep everyone entertained? I'll join you in a moment... I just have to slip into something even more amazing!"
3850,"To Catch a Dragon : Having a dragon guard the fragment was a smart move on the enemy's part.  They can keep moving its location any time we get close to it.Catching Abyssion will be extremely difficult, but I have a plan that might help.The Twilight's Hammer uses magical traps to bind stone drakes to the ground while they drain their energy.If we can get our hands on one of these, we might be able to ground the Twilight Dragon for just long enough.Go east of here, to the Alabaster Shelf, and obtain a trap."
3851,"Aggressive Growth : Our warriors are doing everything they can to hold back the elementals, but their numbers are endless. We need to do something to slow down the assault.Find some suitable patches of dirt or ash out on the Ashen Fields to our north and plant these seeds. They will grow deadly vines that may slow down our enemies a bit. It's not much, but every bit helps."
3852,
3853,"Ji of the Huojin : Another of my most talented students is awaiting you in Wu-Song Village to the northwest. He is of a different mind than Aysa, but in their differences, they bring balance to each other.Ji Firepaw will instruct you on gathering the offerings for the spirit of fire. Trust in his wisdom."
3854,"The Admiral's Cabin : It's possible we'll find further clues inside the admiral's cabin. You will find it directly below us.See if there are any survivors or information that will lead us closer to the World Pillar fragment.  Be careful, <name>.  Whoever got the crew might still be out there."
3855,The Forgemaster's Log : Go to the tower the slave spoke of.  You should find it on the northeastern end of the camp.If we can act fast enough we might be able to eavesdrop on the forgemaster's meeting.
3856,"Explosive Bonding Compound : This guy's the son of the Earthen leader! He almost made it to the temple when he got ambushed by more rock flayers than I can count!We know that the Earthen Stonefather has the middle fragment of the World Pillar. Maybe if we were to heal his son, the Stonefather would give us the fragment?My heals won't work on Flint here. But if we were to get some of the quartzite resin off of these monsters, I think I can make an explosive compound that will bond and cauterize his wounds."
3857,Violent Gale : There is a task that I can set before you.It is a dangerous task. Completing it will help impress the more stubborn Stone Lords.To the northwest is the Scoured Reach. Severe winds batter the rock and hide the true living threat underneath.Within the Scoured Reach are Gyreworms. They devour rock and move through it as if it were water. They do the same thing to our rocky skin.Find Felsen the Enduring. Have him direct you to the Crumbling Depths. I will speak to you once you get that far.
3858,"Big Game, Big Bait : We're only going to get one shot at capturing Abyssion, <name>.  Let's make it count.We'll test out the trap on the biggest of the stone dragons in the Alabaster Shelf.To lure the stone matriarch, we're going to need to gather sufficient bait.Take this knife and carve 5 sides of basilisk meat.  That ought to be enough even for her appetite."
3859,Wisp Away : The fire elementals are pouring out of portals on the far side of the Ashen Fields. We need someone to close them. Cut off some of their reinforcements.Banishing these kinds of elemental magics is something our wisps are perfectly suited for. One will come with you. Lead it to a portal and keep it alive until it finishes.
3860,"The Enemy of My Enemy : I hate to ask you to do this, but I guess it's why they pay you the big bucks. Can you deliver that dead orc's field journal to whoever is in charge up at their camp?Based on the writing in the book, they should be located at the top of the island, up the incline past the Kaja'mite cavern to the southeast.Good luck, <name>. I always liked you."
3861,Stronger Than Bone : This giant jade tiger pillar doesn't seem to fit in amidst the hozen buildings.What it does seem is very hard. Very solid.You know just the person to bring this to.
3862,"Fire Flowers : My fellow druid, Choluna, has asked us to collect any specimens of plant life that we might find here in the Firelands......I don't know whose idea it was to bring scholars to a warfront.Nevertheless, you will already be in the cave - killing things - so be on the lookout for anything growing out of the ground."
3863,"The Real Race : Ok, Darkmoon Racer, let's see what you got!  The real race has four legs: get to the blue post, then green, then red, then back here.   Your time matters, so do it fast!"
3864,"The Wrong Sequence : The Twilight's Hammer must be stopped from using the Waygate. There's only one thing to do.Punch in the wrong activation sequence and destroy it.Hmm, let's see. Yes, here's one that opens upon the explosive depths of the Firelands, the elemental plane of fire. That should do nicely."
3865,
3866,"The Gallywix Labor Mine : We barely escaped with our hides intact!The Trade Prince has a whole bunch of us enslaved and performing manual labor inside the cavern.Greely helped the seven of us to get out, but she was recaptured in the process.<name>, you're the only one crazy enough to walk into an exploding volcano! The assistant will be able to help you free the others.Hurry! This place is about to blow for good!"
3867,"The Fastest Way to His Heart : Oh, girl! You're never going to guess who's out on the oil platform to the north.<Izzy shakes her head sadly at you.>Chip's out there, and he's working for the Trade Prince. That cold-hearted snake dropped you like a bad habit and now he's working for the other team. I even heard he's going out with that tramp, Candy Cane!I don't know about you, but if he was my ex, I'd rip his still-beating heart out of his chest."
3868,"Stronger Than Reeds : Gather me reeds from the nearby pools.Do not question why. Do, and then observe the results."
3869,"The Direct Solution : Alright <name>, this is the second time we've had to deal with ravaging hozen. I think it's time we take care of this problem the Huojin way. No more patience. No more mediation. We go to the source.We're going into the hozen village to the north and we're punishing those smelly troublemakers. I've been looking forward to a chance to fight by your side again, <name>."
3870,"Send a Message : The Oomlot leader, Yngwie, is too powerful to be left alive. He's barking nonsense from the raised west side of the village, across the rope bridge.Go up there and get him before he sends the rest of the village against us.Piece of cake!"
3871,"Volcanoth! : It took a lot of blood, sweat, and tears, but the Bootzooka, patent-pending, is ready for use!These no-good pygmies have been feeding our people to their ""god"", Volcanoth, and they're about to unleash it on our town!You have to get into the cave and kill that thing before it's too late!"
3872,"The Ultimate Footbomb Uniform : Look, kid, I'm here to see to it that you've got a fighting chance at the end game. Thrall's going to need your help in the fight against the Trade Prince.Greely, Hobart, and I have a plan to put together the ultimate footbomb uniform for you so that you can win the game, but I'm going to need some things first.Lucky for us, this lumber yard is sick with spare shredder parts. Now get out there and give me 110%!"
3873,"The Uninvited Guest : While you were dealing with the pirates, I noticed the Trade Prince slip upstairs. He's up on the balcony at the top of the stairs.<name>, I think he's the one that sent the pirates.<Sassy cringes.>You'd better get up there A.S.A.P.! You wouldn't want to keep him waiting."
3874,"Punting Season : Baby turtles are sweet, even if they can be somewhat bitey.<Mylune holds up a bandaged finger.>But they're so slow with their tiny little legs, they can't escape the fire creatures who are attacking Hyjal!<Mylune claps her hands together.>PLEASE save them, <name>! Pick up the wee turtles and punt them into the water of the Ashen Lake. Don't worry about the kicking, they have hard shells.They also have hard teeth, so don't pick them up by the mouth."
3875,"It's Our Problem Now : Looks like those monkeys will steal anything! Those thieving little monsters have driven the teraptor matriarch into a frenzy by stealing her eggs. Worse yet, the eggs have started to hatch! We've got hungry teraptor hatchlings running around all over the place, looking to make a quick meal out of us!We didn't start this, but it's our problem now. You'll have to head into the jungle and kill those hungry teraptor hatchlings before they kill us all."
3876,Borrow Bastia : Head back down to the coast and tell Kilag that I'd like for you to borrow Bastia. The panther knows the way to where your friends are being held captive.Go now. I will see you again before we make our move against the Trade Prince.
3877,"Maziel's Ascendancy : Maziel's journal chronicles a ritual of ascendancy that would transfigure his body to one of pure quicksilver.The ritual would take place in the cave near the Lower Silvermarsh, where Maziel would feed upon the mercurial oozes until achieving full strength.Perhaps it is not too late to put an end to his madness."
3878,"Traitors Return : The Druids of the Flame assault our front line, <name>.These vile creatures have turned their backs on Elune's teachings and worship instead the Fire Lord, Ragnaros. Twisted by his insane power, they desire nothing more than to bury us in ash.We must counter their attack immediately!"
3879,"Irresistible Pool Pony : I've got a plan and you're the only one that I know crazy enough to pull it off!I need you to take this irresistible pool pony to the Vashj'elan Spawning Pool and inflate it. Then, swim down to their hatchlings with it on. I'll bet anything that the hatchlings can be lured away to follow you.Bring them back here and we'll proceed with the next phase of the plan."
3880,"Rolling with my Homies : <name>, you're about to host the corporate party to end all corporate parties. My research says that if you're seen having a good time at the party, your promotion quotient will skyrocket and explode!So, with that in mind, might I suggest that you take your new company hot rod out for a spin?Go pick up your friends. Just remember me on the way up when it all comes together and you're the new Trade <Prince/Princess>, okay?"
3881,"Unlocking the Secrets Within : The initials seem to have worn off of this locket, but I can sense a power within it that suggests only one possible owner:Leyara, the Druid of the Flame.Stand back, and we shall see what surprises this locket contains."
3882,"Captain's Log : <You leaf to the final, interrupted entry.>...approaching the Temple of Earth at 300 knots and commencing landing maneuvers according to new route.  We've made note of a low pressure system in the north and redrawn our...BLOOD AND THUNDER!  ALLIANCE SCUM APPROACH!!"
3883,"Hatred Runs Deep : I would apologize for Boden, but stone is stubborn.It does not sway from its ways without the wear of time.The Stone Lords, Boden and I among them, are charged with retrieving the World Pillar.In that, we are at odds.I would extend my patience upon you, <race>.Prove that you are no ally of the Twilight Cult or Deathwing...Carry our hatred upon them.Strike swiftly where we cannot.Succeed and I will listen."
3884,"The Twilight Flight : Terrath wants you to make your way to the far end of the precipice to fight Zoltrik Drakebane. He is on his way there as well, but he thinks Zoltrik is likely to take to the sky.Quite an impression you seem to have made, little one. Have you ever mused that none of this would have happened if I had just stepped on you during our first meeting? Fate is a strange thing."
3885,"Elemental Bonds: Patience : With the Stonemother's blessing, I can take us to where Go'el is being held.We must be careful. The Twilight's Hammer has agents all around. You help me hold them off while I attempt to get through to Go'el!Speak with me when you are ready, and I will take you to him."
3886,"Rage Against the Flames : Of all of our tasks here in Hyjal, the most pressing is simple: destroy these invaders. The very nature of fire is that it is all-consuming. Lower your defense for just a moment and it will destroy everything in sight.Kill any of the fiery invaders you find. Every enemy defeated purchases more time for Hyjal."
3887,The Hero Returns : The Stonefather is waiting for you back south at Stonehearth.Make yourself presentable. You've earned a hero's welcome!
3888,"On Even Ground : We're fortunate dat those giants be havin' such bad aim. Luck is sure to be favorin' dem eventually though.We need to get dem off da battlefield, but I don't tink takin' dem head on would be very smart.Take dis grapplin' line, get a good hold on one of their ankles and pull their legs out from under dem. Once dey are on da ground, dey should be easy ta be finishin' off."
3889,The Power of Malorne : <Matoclaw's voice continues.>The portal that opened up to our east is guarded by a powerful flamewaker by the name of Galenges. We will need all of Malorne's help in defeating him.Do you remember the staff that I gave you? Place it in the pile of ash in front of the portal. Then pray that Malorne comes to your aid.
3890,"Magnets, How Do They Work? : Getting useful machine parts out here on the island has been difficult, <name>.  We have been trying to repair the broken siege engines here in camp but we keep running out of useful parts.Our second regiment reported some wrecked out siege engines in a old battlefield to the west.  Maybe we could find some parts over there?You are going to have trouble finding anything in that old battlefield so take this magnetized scrap collector and put it to some good use."
3891,"The Way of the Huojin : We call those vicious monkeys swinging into town hozen. They keep to themselves normally, but they know something bad is coming, so they're here to steal our supplies.In situations like this, the clear answer is the only answer. These monkeys will leave when we force them to leave! To not defend our town and those we love would be the only true crime. Thus is the way of the Huojin."
3892,"The Lesson of Dry Fur : Through meditation, I intend to find a route to locating Shu. In the meantime, you would benefit from practice and discipline.Your first task is the task of all trainees entering the pools: cross the balance poles to the west and ring the bell without falling into the pool.Should you fall, the pool's curse will make it difficult to get on a pole again, so you will need to return to the edge of the pool to start over.Oh, and beware the cranes."
3893,"Medical Supplies : We need supplies to tend to our wounded, but the supply crates containing them were scattered in the crash. If you can bring back any crates you find, I would be very grateful."
3894,"Shredder Shutdown : That no-good Trade Prince Gallywix somehow managed to stow the whole Steamwheedle Sharks footbomb team away on the yacht. I didn't even see any of them!Now he has them doing his dirty work here at the lumber yard. <name>, you're the <guy/gal> who won the championship for us back home on Kezan. You've got to get rid of them!"
3895,"Battlefront Triage : You seem quick on your feet, <race>. I need someone to go out into the chaos of the front and patch up our injured.Take my kit. It's simple enough to use.Heal them before the stone troggs finish them off for good."
3896,"Word In Stone : You have done as I've asked of you, <race>. I shall honor my word. Gorsik will meet you at the temple with our piece of the World Pillar.Finish your ritual and bind the rift. After you have done such, tell your Earthen Ring to leave this place.You however... you can stay for a time if you want. You've earned at least that."
3897,"Fandral's Methods : The Druids of the Flame... an order of druids that, up until a few weeks ago, Tholo and I had never even heard of. Now, under the leadership of Fandral Staghelm, they threaten our mission's success with their mastery of fire.It would appear that they store some supplies in the Igneous Depths, to the northeast. Perhaps, if we can get some of those supplies, we will have more luck when we take the fight to Fandral."
3898,"The Spirit's Guardian : You've done very well this far, my student. You have the materials you need to rekindle Huo, the spirit of fire.In the cave to the southwest he awaits, but he is guarded by Master Li Fei, the pandaren elder you met in the Cave of Meditation. Go to Master Li Fei with the offerings. Prove yourself, then meet with Huo."
3899,
3900,"Get to the Gyrochoppa! : The Alliance have stolen something of vital importance to the Horde. It is being held out on their ships.At the other end of the beach is a gyrochoppa. Our battlesworn will cover your approach.Go retrieve the keys to the flying machine from one of their operatives.Fly out to their flagship, the Vengeance Wake, and retrieve our precious cargo!"
3901,"Oomlot Village : The pygmies took most of our people back to their village. Who knows what evil they're up to?<name>, you have to go up there and free all of the captives before the pygmies work their voodoo on them!Izzy's already up near Oomlot Village to the southeast. She'll give you the heads-up on what's going down.Your pygmy helmet looks like it's in bad shape, but it should last long enough for you to get there.I hope."
3902,"Repel the Paratroopers : The Alliance have caught back up with us at just the wrong moment, my friend. We took care of their ships, but they still have planes that are dropping their vaunted 127th Paratroopers onto the coast below.It's all that the battlesworn and scouts can do to hold the two ramps against their overwhelming numbers. I'm certain that if you were to aid them, the tide would quickly be turned."
3903,"Robbing Hoods : We're all going to die!!!<You slap Megs to calm her down.>Sorry about that, <Mr./Ms.> <name>. Okay, we need to find a way to get a lot of moolah quickly.There are reports of the Trade Prince sending hired looters into the streets.You could take the hot rod out there and run them down, snatching the loot that they've illegally stolen. There wouldn't be anything wrong with that, right?"
3904,"Relieving the Pain : The Arch Druid has an immense tolerance for pain. I've treated burn victims that spend twenty-two hours a day screaming in pain, and their burns weren't even half as bad as what Hamuul has suffered.Nevertheless, I can sense that he is in greater discomfort than normal today. Bring me the hearts of the large fire elementals to the southeast. I can use them to prepare a soothing salve for our patient."
3905,"Flamewakers of the Molten Flow : Of all Ragnaros' minions, the flamewakers appear to be the most devoted. Most of them dwell within this cave, preparing for another attack. Our foothold may be strong, but we will not tolerate any surprise attacks from these worms.No, we will strike first.Tear them apart, <name>."
3906,"The Healing of Shen-zin Su : This is more horrific than I imagined, but we can handle this. We need to gather the healers and close the wound. We need to save Shen-zin Su.Find any healers you can! Rescue them, relieve them - whatever you need to do to get them over here healing the wound.Keep the healers safe at all costs!"
3907,"Who's Top of the Food Chain Now? : Fine, fine, perhaps the whole egg thing didn't quite pan out. Who's up for some shark meat?Only one little problem. Well, a big problem, actually. A really BIG problem: The Hammer!Of course, I have a brilliant idea. Swim out into the Dire Strait to the west and get us some shark parts. Give them to my assistant, Greely. I'm too important to get my hands dirty with the small details."
3908,"Petrified Delicacies : Petrified bats.Elementals of that size are picky. You're not likely to find anything better easily.To the east are basilisks. They petrify stone bats that fly too close and snack on them when they grow hungry. You may find bats scattered around their territory.I must warn you... if you show that little elemental too much attention, you're unlikely to be rid of it. It can be very... needy."
3909,"Motes : Some of the rarest crystals form in the most dangerous places. In the Crumbling Depths, you will find painite formations - much better than the gold that your races cherish so much.As a being of flesh and a being of small stature, you can enter the Crumbling Depths to retrieve motes of painite for me. Would you undergo that danger on my behalf?"
3910,"Echoes of Nemesis : <Mylune's voice sings like a melody in your head.>Remember that awful fire turtle, Nemesis, from the Firelands? He's dead now (yay!) but echoes of him keep trying to break through to Mount Hyjal.Go to the shores of the Ashen Lake and speak with my friend Tooga. Let him know you're ready to fight an echo of Nemesis, and the turtles will draw him into this world. Then you can hit him! Hard!Hide inside of Tooga's shell if he starts to erupt."
3911,"The Imprisoned Archmage : We have been trying to clear out the Cursed Depths cellblock since we landed on Tol Barad.  It seems that everytime we get close, that archmage shows up and pushes us back.Now that we have claimed the island, it's time we take another shot.  Head down there and bring me back his staff as proof that you have finished the job."
3912,"The Suffering of Shen-zin Su : Now is not the time to grieve. The balloon is ready, and Shen-zin Su awaits.We shall be the first pandaren to speak to Shen-zin Su in hundreds of years. It is a great honor."
3913,"Rock Bottom : I've one more favor to ask, fleshling.There is a basilisk, much larger and much older than the rest. Though we normally fear nothing from their kind, this one has become so potent as to petrify some of my sons. This shall not be abided.Find Gorgonite to the east and slay him. He has lived much longer than necessary."
3914,Sprout No More : The stone trogg mystics are creating those fungal monstrosities from the giant mushrooms to the north.I want you to take a war guardian to help deal with the giants and stone troggs. Make your way to the giant mushrooms and target them. I and my geomancers will sink them into the ground before the mystics have a chance to finish their ritual.
3915,"Elemental Bonds: Desire : Once again, <class>, I cannot do this without your help. I will try to quiet this tempest, but you will need to fight back the unstable elementals that whirl around it. Only then can we free Go'el!"
3916,"The Flame Spider Queen : The Widow's Clutch, to the northeast, is named after Beth'tilac, the enormous queen of the flame spiders. Her webs and her poison are a nagging threat to our main offensive force.We believe that if we study the flame spiders here on the Molten Front, we can use that information to find success against Beth'tilac. Use whatever methods you can to gather their venom and their web fluid, then return to my trusted friend Anren."
3917,"Into Unrelenting Flame : We must travel now to the Firelands. Within that realm, Go'el's burning spirit could become as terrible as Ragnaros himself! Prepare yourself, for we will be alone in a hostile world.Speak with me when you are ready... and may the ancestors protect us!"
3918,"Breach in the Defenses : Lava worms are bursting through the ground behind our lines, breaking our formations and allowing elementals to slip through. You'll find them scattered throughout our entire front to the north, and upon the Ashen Fields further out.Stomp them back into their holes."
3919,"The Quaking Fields : Before you can help us here, you're going have to deal with Therazane, the Stone Mother's, forces to the south. The elementals and giants upon the Quaking Fields are being mustered.They too are after the middle fragment of the World Pillar. They'll attack us amidst our war with the stone troggs and we'll be unable to repel them.I've sent the arch geomancer ahead. Get to Slate Quicksand and do as he asks."
3920,"D-Block : Have you heard of the D-Block yet <name>?  It's one of the old cellblocks here on the island.  Problem is, it's infested with demons.  We planned on using it to lock up the leftover Horde we found on the island, but that is not going to happen in its current state.I need you to head down there and clear those demons out.  Report back to me when you are done."
3921,"The Forgotten : Many soldiers died on this island <name>.  It is only fair that we pay our respects to them in any way that we can.I need you to travel to Forgotten Hill, due west of here and release our brothers in arms' tortured souls away from this place.  Do be careful over there, reports of undead have been ongoing in the area."
3922,"The Warchief Wants You : True to his word, Thrall is going to get us going in the right direction to rescue our people. He asked to speak with you.Good luck, <name>. We're all depending on you."
3923,"The Hunt Begins : The Shadow Wardens have joined the fight at the Molten Front, on your request. You should find Captain Saynna Stormrunner and see to it that they've found a way to best apply their skills."
3924,Salvaging the Remains : Forgotten Hill has been overrun with zombies and ghouls ever since we reclaimed this wretched isle.  We have tried to clear them out many times but they always seem to come back.One of our lieutenants recommended taking the ghouls' bones when we kill them in hopes that they can't reincarnate overnight.  Think you can help us out with this one?
3925,"The Source of Our Livelihood : We have done as Master Shang asked of us. I will return to the temple to inform the master of our progress. You should continue south on the road to the farmlands to seek out Wugou, the spirit of earth.Ji awaits you at the Dai-Lo Farmstead, and he'll surely need your help. I must warn you, Ji can be reckless in his directness. Remember well the things I have taught you: discipline and patience."
3926,"Balanced Perspective : Aysa has been meditating on the lake since we've arrived, all her thoughts focused on Dafeng. I don't know what she hopes to discover out there, but she's no fool, and Master Shang Xi has entrusted this task with her.You will need to cross the ropes leading from the end of the dock to reach her. It shall test your balance, but I think you're up to the task, <name>."
3927,"Up, Up & Away! : While you were rescuing the Warchief and saving us all from the Alliance, Foreman Dampwick built this rocket sling to shoot us over the shark-infested strait to the bigger island.Luckily for us, the foreman managed to salvage a Town-In-A-Box from the shipwreck. Once you get it set up, we'll have a town of our own. I can't wait to sleep in a bed again!Dampwick's down there at the Landing Site, waiting for you. Why don't you take the next rocket over?"
3928,"Oomlot Dealt With : <name>, you have to get back to the Town-In-A-Box and warn them about the goblin zombies up in the volcano's caldera!"
3929,"Rockin' Powder : I'll give these pygmies one thing... they sure know how to party! But they're not so clever. I think I've discovered the source of their rockin' powers: Rockin' Powder!It turns out that this stuff, which turns them into world-class rockers, is also highly explosive. We must have it!So, while you're in there at Oostan to the east, make sure that you pickup a whole bunch of the stuff. Trust me, you're going to need it for what's coming up!"
3930,"Bleed the Bloodshaper : The Twilight's Hammer are wielding foul magic here, <name>.  They animate and energize the remains of Deathwing's blood, so that instead of drying out and disappearing it thrives and becomes more abundant.Take out one of the bloodshapers, see if they have any clues as to where we can find this ""forgemaster."""
3931,"Apply and Flash Dry : Alright, take this and apply it to his wounds. If the cauterizing effect of the flash dry explosion doesn't crack him wide open, it should completely heal him.I think."
3932,"Shaken and Stirred : I have sent my brothers to assault the Verlok village from below. The Verlok will gather on their rocky ledges, as they always do to avoid our ire. When they do, we shall make the earth itself shake them until they fall at our feet below.That is where you prove your use. When they fall to the ground amongst my brothers, make sure that they do not rise again."
3933,"Into Coaxing Tides : Go'el must be in the plane of water... the Abyssal Maw itself! I shudder to imagine what fate awaits him there.Find the elemental, Hydrius, near the Abyssal Breach. He knows of Go'el and is sympathetic to our fight against Ragnaros. If anyone can help you there, it's him.I will meet you beneath the tides of Vashj'ir, <race>..."
3934,Through Persistence : The troggs did not disperse after you killed Glop. His servants recovered the growth agent that was left behind and continue to sow the seeds of corruption across the Crimson Expanse.Hunt them down and recover any of the remaining Verlock Miracle-Grow that you find. It must be disposed of.
3935,"Risking It All : Wait, what?! How could he be so reckless? Blowing the ship free is insane! They could kill Shen-zin Su, and all of us with it. I know we don't have much time, but we need to think of another way..."
3936,"Welcome to the Darkmoon Races : So this is your first race, eh? Don't worry - it's easier than it looks. Let me break it down for you...  Run through that big  banner there. That starts everything. Then, follow the smaller banners until you see a big, blue Post. Hit that, then return here.  You're scored on your time, so finish as fast as you can! And watch out for those electrified tripwires. They'll slow you down if you run through them. Good luck!"
3937,"Fragile Values : It is now time to draw the Broodmother's attention. To do so, we will need a mallet that the troggs use when making offerings to her.Seek out the Stone Trogg Beast Tamers that are attempting to tame basilisks in the southern portions of the Pale Roost. You will find a mallet on one of their corpses."
3938,"Singed Wings : Many of our Storm Crows have gone ahead to scout the peak and attempt to retrieve some of the fire hawk eggs, but to very little success I'm afraid. The thermals make it nearly impossible to fly safely, and the fire hawks aren't exactly friendly either.I need you to head over there and rescue any druids that you can. I've got splints, bandages, burn salves, smelling salts... anything you'll need to get them back on their feet, assuming they're still alive. Please hurry and help anyone you can find."
3939,"Zombies vs. Super Booster Rocket Boots : Those zombies that got past us are nothing compared to the numbers waiting just through the pass. If we don't deal with them soon, the pygmy witch doctors are going to send all of them against the town, and even the cannons down there won't be able to handle that many!I brought a couple of shredder boots along. Greely modded them and now they're Super Booster Rocket Boots!Use the boots to incinerate the zombies in the Oostan villages to the east."
3940,"Trouble in the Mines : We've got trouble down in the Kaja'mine again, boss. The tunneling worms have returned and they're literally eating away at the Kajaro Trading Company's profits!Kaja'mite mining is down, which is negatively impacting our production of Kaja'Cola!I tried calling the exterminator, but he's fled with the last payment we made to him.Do you think you could head into the three mines and take care of it? I'd help but I still haven't attended the cartel-mandated fighter training seminar."
3941,"Hard Falls : Stone Dragons bow only to strength. When we have punished them enough, they will bend back to our will.I have sent many of my strongest giants onto the fields in the west. They will bring the drakes to the ground. You will see to it that they do not take wing again after they fall."
3942,
3943,"The Sun Pearl : Shu, the spirit of water, is eternally young, as are all the spirits of Shen-zin Su. I have been friends with Shu all of my life, but I no longer have it within me to play with him. I am old, and lack the energy.For all his complexities, Shu is simple to please: he desires friendship. When I returned to play with Shu each season, I would always bring a Sun Pearl as a gift, and then we would play together. You can find a Sun Pearl in the pools to the southeast. Perhaps you can be his new friend."
3944,"New Allies : <name>, I did what had to be done. And the plan worked. Things could have been much worse had we not acted. I only wish Aysa could understand that.There will be plenty of time for reflection, but for now, we need to return to the Temple of Five Dawns. We need to let them know that Shen-zin Su has been saved, and we need to sort out the fates of these new allies."
3945,"Don't. Stop. Moving. : When Deathwing came, the Stone Dragons flocked to him. In his absence, they are again without purpose. They swarm and feed upon our kin.I have bound dozens of Opalescent Guardians, but am unable to lead them from the safety of cover. I need someone more swift, as I suspect you might be.Lead them by ground towards Therazane's Throne to the east. Surely, some will not make it, but as long as you keep moving, you should be able to bring several to join our forces there."
3946,"The Leftovers : We fought hard to capture this island, <race>.  We cleared out most of the Alliance filth but I can still smell their foul stench in the air.I need you to investigate the slagworks, warden's vigil and the ironclad garrison.  Kill any Alliance that you find.You know what they say, the only good Alliance is a dead Alliance!"
3947,Little Lasher : The little red flower wiggles its tendrils happily. It seems to like you!Perhaps Avrilla would like to see what grew out of the acorn.
3948,"The Missing Driver : My driver went running off after the sprites just after they attacked. I don't think they'll really do him any harm, but I need him back to help me clean up the mess by the cart.He chased them off towards the cliffs to the north. If you head that direction, you should find him quickly."
3949,"Fanning the Flames : Strange thing about wind, it can be hard to wrap your hands around it.Best practice for me has been finding some sort of living wind. If it can punch you, you can punch it back, and it won't slip through your grasp.Head over to the Shrine of the Summer Breeze to the south and summon just such a living wind using this wind stone. Best it, gather a Fluttering Breeze from it, and come back over this way so that we can figure out what's next."
3950,"Stronger Than Wood : Gather me wood planks from construction near the Ki-Han Brewery.You do not yet know the extent of my strength, so I shall display it to you."
3951,"Goblin Escape Pods : <name>, I'm sorry, I thought you were dead!This is just crazy. We sailed into a fight between the Alliance and Horde!You know, our brothers and sisters still need to be rescued.<He points out all of the escape pods in the water around you.>I think I'm going to sit here a while longer and catch my breath. Can you swim around and let them out? Take my pair of thermohydratic flippers so you can get around faster.Let Sassy know that I'll swim in shortly."
3952,"Town-In-A-Box: Under Attack : <name>, you have to defend us!I had the eggheads deploy the town's cannon defenses, but it seems like there's an unlimited supply of these Oomlot warriors!Get your behind into one of those B.C. Eliminators and eliminate the pygmy threat to the town!"
3953,
3954,"Putting the Pieces Together : <race>. If you act in the service of the Stone Lords, there are those that might aid you.Watch for the Stonebound. They lie dormant all around the Shuddering Spires. It should not take much prompting to rebind them to service against the flayers."
3955,"Good-bye, Sweet Oil : There is single big, red button on the platform control console. Clearly if ever there were a button to cause massive explosions, that is it!"
3956,"Waltz Right In : There's only one way we're going to get a bazillion macaroons: stealing from the rich!That slime, the Trade Prince, has stolen all kinds of antiques and expensive art. It's time to take them back and give them to the needy... mainly us!Hobart left behind a cap he was working on. It's a disguise that'll make you look like one of Gallywix's mooks. All you have to do is waltz right in to his Villa to the west and 'procure' the items.Just watch out for his pigs who can smell through the disguise!"
3957,"The Stone March : My forces have already begun the assault. Join them. Spill the blood of these cultists upon the ground, that I might feel how they suffer."
3958,"The Twilight Overlook : The dragon they're speaking of is Abyssion, <name>.  It's not going to be easy to get the fragment off of him.Meet with Mylra again.  She is operating nearby at the Twilight Overlook.She will tell you what our next move will be."
3959,"Monkey Business : We've got major problems with the monkeys in the jungle to the east. They've stolen all of our explosives, and now they're going around throwing them.Sometimes at us!I had Fizz Lighter take some of his nitro and put it in these bananas. No monkey can resist a bunch of bananas!All you have to do is go out there and feed them."
3960,"Preying on the Predators : The forest has become far more dangerous ever since Shen-zin Su began shaking. The tigers are agitated and have begun attacking the refugees, and on occasion, me as well.If these injured and weak survivors are to make it to safety here at the hut, we need to help clear the forest for them."
3961,"Pirate Party Crashers : Oh my gosh! Pirates!<name>, there are Southsea pirates crashing your party!You have to get in there and do something about this or your career, and any chance of you being the next Trade <Prince/Princess>, is going to be ruined!"
3962,"The Earth Claims All : We're in the plane of earth, <name>.  Everything is absorbed by the land eventually.The Storm's Fury will soon be turned to dust and we won't be able to gain any insight from its remains.Go and destroy the elementals that are dismantling the ship.  We're only delaying the inevitable, but we need to buy ourselves some time if we're to track down all the pieces of the World Pillar."
3963,"Our Part of the Bargain : Sadly, I must stay and hold the rift, so you will have to battle without me. Go now to Therazane and join the battle, as promised. You should find her at the Halcyon Egress, north of Lorthuna's Gate and east of the Scoured Reach.When our part of the bargain is fulfilled, bring the last piece of the World Pillar here as quickly as possible."
3964,"Flight of the Storm Crows : Many of the Druids of the Talon have made their way to the Molten Front, at your beckoning. You should go to Skylord Omnuron at Malfurion's Breach and see how their wings are faring in those burning skies."
3965,"Treating the Wounds : We have an ample supply of medical supplies here at the Sanctuary, but we mustn't lose sight of the fact that we are at war. Hamuul isn't the only person who has need of bandages.The fiery behemoths that roam Sethria's Roost wear flame-resistant wrappings that will serve Hamuul as ably as any bandage. Bring me those wrappings, and I will prepare them for use on the Arch Druid."
3966,"It's a Town-In-A-Box : The trade prince had an entire town-in-a-box in the ship's hold! I managed to recover it while you were out saving all of our skins.Do you want to do the honors? All you have to do is climb to the top of that huge pile of explosives and push the plunger, and whamo kablamo, instant town!"
3967,"Megs in Marketing : Boss, while you were down at the mines, Megs Dreadshredder in marketing was asking for you. Something about your new ride?She's right outside the building to the left."
3968,"Entrenched : Your intentions appear true.I will impress upon the other Stone Lords my wary trust.With this, they should speak to you.More importantly, they should listen.Earning their favor may take time. Earning the Stonemother's favor may take more time. Time is a potent offering, so be generous with it.Among the Shuddering Spires far to the northwest, you shall find Kor the Immovable. He is evenly tempered. His situation lends itself well to seeking outside aid.Go to him."
3969,"Egg-stinction : We have a real problem on our hands. Not only are the nearby spiders vicious and predatory, their numbers appear to be endless.We need to stop the growth of their army. Cut their heads off in the egg, not on the battlefield.The Cinderweb Spinners' eggs are laid among the stone pillars to the north. Collect 20 eggs and bring them back to me."
3970,"Aysa of the Tushui : In such a short time, you've shown me that you have the potential to be a great <class>. The training grounds are behind you, but now you must prove yourself by facing a far greater challenge, one that none of my students have accomplished.I want you to return Huo, the spirit of fire, to the Temple of Five Dawns.My two other most gifted students will help you in this task. The first is Aysa Cloudsinger. Seek her out at the pool to the west."
3971,The Lesson of the Balanced Rock : I require peace to perform my meditation. Practice your arts while I meditate on Shu's location.Other monks practice balance and combat upon the balance poles in the surrounding pools. Engage them and defeat them.
3972,"Weed Whacker : <Kilag barely has time to acknowledge you between rifle shots, but his eye does linger a moment on your Goblin All-In-1-der Belt appreciatively.>Now is the time for creative solutions. Pull something out of that belt and get to work!<Thinking about the situation for a moment, an idea comes to your mind and it's just crazy enough to work!>"
3973,"The New You : A new outfit? You don't say! There's quite a buzz surrounding your party. Everyone who's anyone on the island is going to be there.Well, happy shopping. Swindle Street has some of the best bargains anywhere!"
3974,"Not The Friendliest Town : Have you been up to Rustberg Village yet <name>?  I would suggest you bring a sharpened blade if you are heading that direction.The folks in that town look alright but something suspicious is going on in there.  Reports have been coming in that they are picking off our soldiers left and right.  We have had just about enough of that, so I need you to head down there and do a little cleaning house for us.Take down as many as you can and report back when you are done."
3975,"Taking the Overlook Back : There is only one way for us to take Largo's Overlook back.I think you know what we need to do <name>.  Largo is pretty paranoid these days so you should be able to find him on top of the tower, looking for his imaginary navy to finally arrive."
3976,
3977,"Warchief's Revenge : Brothers of Earth and Fire, hear me! Sisters of the Water and Air, heed my call!Azeroth stands on the brink, its existence near an end! Lend me your power as in times past with my ancient ancestors. Allow me to channel your will through this child of Kezan.Let us put an end to those who would keep us from healing the world!"
3978,"Back to Aggra : Return to the Horde Base Camp and let Aggra know that we still live, <name>.Tell her that I am moving on to the Wild Overlook and that we will all meet up on the northwest side of the island. I expect to see you there.We will track down the Alliance and slay them to the last!"
3979,"Stocking Stalks : My men are malnourished, injured, and exhausted, but they are Horde. Every one will fight to their dying breath. As our new ally, we will stand by you when the time comes, but we would stand stronger with weapons.I have my men out gathering bamboo stalks to fashion into spears. If you can spare the effort, we could use the extra pair of capable hands."
3980,"Let's Ride : Bastia will make sure that you get to where you need to go, goblin."
3981,"Fear of Boring : The gyreworms infest the rock, eating away at it until our home will one day collapse. For every one that is killed, twice as many burst forth to follow, but we must carry on the fight. They must be extinguished.Go to the Crumbling Depths and slaughter any worms that you can find."
3982,"Burn Victims : We have warriors out in the field who are falling wounded, and many of our druids are too busy fighting to give them proper aid. I need you to go to the north, towards the Ashen Fields, and tend their wounds at least enough that they can make it back to safety.If you haven't any bandages or healing spells, I had Rayne put together this salve, which should prove sufficient to get them on their feet."
3983,"Wicked Webs : Some of our scouts have not reported back for duty. We fear they have succumbed to the deadly spiders in the vicinity.Hope may not be lost, however. The spiders often wrap up their live prey in cocoons for later consumption.Go search the pillars to the north for cocooned victims. You may yet be able to save some of our brethren."
3984,"Svarnos : Excellent work on the island capture, <class>.  Now that we have claimed the island, we need to make these cellblocks useable for prisoners.  D-Block has been especially hard to clear out.  Unfortunately it has become overrun with demons of all sorts.We have been able to thin out the demons but a large core hound has broken its way out of its cell and is wreaking havoc down there.  I need you to kill him and bring back his collar."
3985,"Releasing the Pressure : Having been burned so badly, Arch Druid Hamuul is suffering from edema - swelling of the body's tissues. It takes a great deal of his attendants' effort to keep his swelling down enough for him to breathe.Normally, to reduce this swelling, we make cuts in his flesh, but he is weak, <name>. I cannot cut him today. I need your help.Flamewaker scales will aid with the swelling, but you need a lot of them."
3986,"Captain P. Harris : The Cape of Lost Hope has been a sore in our side for weeks here on Tol Barad.  Half of our supply ships end up on the rocks down there.To make matters worse, it's been overrun by a gang of undead sailors.  We have tried thinning the ranks, but they just seem to keep coming back.  Our last resort is to try and take out the captain that they report to.  You should be able to find him on a ship, just off the shoreline.Oh, and I hope you are not too scared of sharks."
3987,"Watch Out For Splinters! : Have you been over to the Wellson Shipyard yet, <name>?  Best to stay away from there unless you have a good reason to venture in.  Unfortunately, that is exactly what I need you to do.You see, we have been short on supplies ever since we recaptured the island.  That ghost ridden shipyard is overflowing with lumber but every time we send an escort to recover the lumber, they never make it back.Can you help us out?"
3988,"Mine Disposal, the Goblin Way : The paratroopers have mined the beach!The Warchief asked me if there's anything we can do about that. I told him, 'You bet we can!'. I was thinking maybe you could take this satchel of grenades and detonate the land mines from a safe distance?It's how we do things, right?!"
3989,"The Great Bank Heist : All of your assets have been frozen and the First Bank of Kezan is out of business!You need an awful lot of moolah, boss. I think you're going to have to go break your own money out of the bank! The different widgets in your Goblin All-In-1-Der belt should be enough to crack the vault.I just hope that you've been saving for a rainy day like I always told you to do. You might have noticed... it's raining hot liquid magma!!!"
3990,"Soft Rock : The corruption of the Crimson Expanse has not subsided. Destroy the Fungal Behemoths that shower their filth upon our realm. If they continue to rise, we will continue to destroy them."
3991,"Thinning the Brood : We have been trying to get a foothold in The Darkwood for weeks now but that forest is infested with spiders.  Do me a favor and see if you can thin them out enough for us to set up an attack.Careful out there, I have heard reports of Alliance troops nearby earlier in the week."
3992,"Aid of the Ancients : The ancients have seen the value of your wisdom, and have set root at Malfurion's Breach. You should seek out Elderlimb. I am certain he would like to hear from you."
3993,"A Sticky Task : Finding supplies on the island has been difficult, to say the least.Fortunately, we have found a good supply of silk in The Darkwood, just west of here.  The bad part of this story is that the silk comes from the glands on Broodmother spiders.  I need you to gather 4 of these for me.That should be just enough to finish up this last set of shirts."
3994,"The Lesson of Stifled Pride : Facing a living opponent is a very different thing from the stationary targets in the yard. Living opponents strike back. There is the very real fear of failure, and sometimes, even death.You must have the courage to overcome those fears.Challenge the other trainees within the temple or down the steps below, and defeat them."
3995,"Missing Mallet : <name>, I've got it! It's simple really. Let's make a ruckus so loud that there's no way he can sleep through it.Why look at that, a conveniently placed gong! Makes me think this may just be how they've awoken him in the past. We just need the matching mallet to get it ringing as loud as possible.The village leader tells me the mallet is over at the Ki-Han Brewery on the river, to the southwest. It's not far. Mind picking it up for me while I give the village some fair warning?"
3996,"Tools of the Enemy : The hozen have stolen our brushes and are painting over our scrolls of wisdom with their own wisdoms, if you can call them that. If you're here to help, stop them and bring our brushes back before they can do more harm."
3997,"Cluster Cluck : Ridiculous! The greatest goblin mind of all time reduced to food detail? I made the Micro Mechachicken just for this reason and they let it get away!<Hobart turns a deeper shade of green as his blood pressure rises.>Do I look like I should be rounding up escaped cluckers? No, my friend, not I! Bamm most definitely, though he's too lazy.Your station in life has recently taken a turn for the worse. You do it!Take these remote control fireworks and attach them to the cluckers."
3998,"Up the Volcano : A whole bunch of our people headed up to the top of the volcano to mount a counter-offensive. There's something horrible brewing up there on the Lost Peak.They're waiting for you before they make any moves against the pygmies. Those evil little things turned a lot of us into zombies!<name>, save us!"
3999,"Handle With Care : We can help you get your ship free, but we'll need more of the explosives we were trying to take back from the Alliance to make it happen.I ordered the men to grab all the explosives they could before making our escape. If you sift through the wreckage and bodies to our south, there should be some explosive bundles among them, those that didn't already blow up anyway.Get me enough of them and I think I can put something together for ya."
4000,"The Replacements : My guys are all on the injured roster! Our shredders are all kaput! The ref is about to call the game!It's down to the wire and I need you, <name>!!!Let's get one of these shredders in working condition. There are replacement parts all over Bilgewater Port. Any green-blooded Kezanian will gladly let you have them if there's a chance that the Buccaneers will win.We'll show those no-good Steamwheedle Sharks how to play footbomb!"
4001,"Finding an Old Friend : It seems Shu, the spirit of water, had a play companion when he came to the pools throughout the years. An old pandaren we know as Old Man Liang.Liang moved away from the main town and stopped practicing in the pools some time ago. I am told he lives in a small house northeast of here, up the hill.Liang may know what has driven Shu away, and where the spirit might be found.Go to Liang. Ask of Shu."
4002,"Capturing the Unknown : Heya, <name>, there are strange cave paintings and other artifacts all over the cavern.Do you think you could use your belt-mounted KTC Snapflash camera to capture images at the designated spots? Also, snap a pic of the altar in the back of the cavern.I'm sure that Sassy will want the intel."
4003,"Do No Evil : <name>, I need you to understand that the way of the Huojin is not the way of violence. When fighting is needed, we will not hesitate, but when fighting is not needed, neither do we instigate. However, the direct solution is often cutting the head off the snake, as they say.The hozen have a leader instigating these attacks. If we remove Ruk-Ruk, we won't have to wipe the hozen out entirely.I know you are not of the Huojin, but are you with me in what must be done, <name>?"
4004,To the Cliffs : I sent Scout Brax forward along the road to the cliffs overlooking the beach to the west.I am going to put you onto Bastia. Travel down the path and let Brax know that we are going to take a different route.We'll see you at the attack on the Alliance beachhead!
4005,"Do it Yourself : We need to send a message to several deadbeats. Of course, they're hiding out in Drudgetown, the scum. I know how you hate going into the slums, boss-<man/lady>, but what can we do?<Sassy rifles through some paperwork.>I have all of the names right here.Might I suggest a little 'personal visit'? A couple of strategic beatdowns will send a message to the other debtors AND your competition.<name> is not a goblin to be trifled with!"
4006,"Give Sassy the News : I'd celebrate with you, <name>, but it feels like that dragon did a number on ol' Mount Kajaro. I... uh... I think I'm gonna grab my stuff and get on the first ship leaving the island!Anyways, you should probably head back to headquarters and let Sassy know that you won the footbomb title for us. I'm sure she'll also want to know about the dragon and Mount Kajaro.Good luck!"
4007,"Cursed Shackles : Have you been down in the D-Block yet, <name>?  Every time we clear that infested cellblock out, the demons seem to return rather quickly.  We learned that they regenerate from the cursed shackles scattered around the area.  That's where you come in to the picture <name>.I need you to retrieve as many of those shackles as you can and bring them back to me.  We will destroy them immediately."
4008,"WANTED: Foreman Wellson : Foreman Wellson has been a pain in our side since we got here.  His shipyard holds a large amount of supplies that would be extremely useful to us... if we could get to them.He keeps a close watch over his minions and makes it very difficult for us to get a foothold on the shipyard.  I need you to take out Wellson for good this time.  Be careful <name>, we have been receiving reports of filthy Horde all around the area."
4009,"Worthy of Passing : The four elemental spirits will help you speak with the land and uncover its plight, but first, I have one small task to ask of you.Join me, my pupil. Accompany this old pandaren to the western grove."
4010,"Good Help is Hard to Find : The excavation team is on strike!Foreman Thazwix and his cronies think they can squeeze the Steamwheedle Preservation Society for some extra dough by refusing to work.What I need is a scab, a strikebreaker; someone to put some pressure on them by doing the job they refuse to do!Go down into the gorge, dig up some antiquities for me, and I'll pay you what I would have payed those lazy numbskulls!"
4011,"A Huge Problem : We finally capture this godforsaken rock and then we find out that there is a huge ettin roaming around, taking out our sentry patrols!<name>, I need you to round up a few friends and take that ettin down.  We can't have a beast like that roaming around, wreaking havoc.Stay alert, reports from the front say that he is carrying a huge tree as a weapon, and he is not afraid to use it."
4012,A Lieutenant of Flame : Captain Saynna has requested your presence at Ragnaros' Reach. A Lieutenant of Flame has shown himself and she thinks you are our greatest chance at striking against him.Make your way there as soon as you're able.
4013,"Bombs Away! : The Wellson Shipyard is constantly receiving supplies from offshore and we need to put a stop to it.  They have setup cannons along the docks for defense but if you can make it to them, we can use them to destroy their supply ships.Head down there and see what you can do.  Report back to me on your progress."
4014,
4015,"Rascals : I'll keep trying to find ways to wake this stubborn little guy up, but there is no shortage of trouble on the island it seems. The crops to the south are infested with virmen, rabbit-like thieves and pillagers.Rascals!They breed faster than we can kill them! I have the perfect solution for such a situation: kill them faster! With you here, <name>, that shouldn't be a problem."
4016,"Trading Up : Hobart thinks he's going to feed us on those tiny clucker eggs? Bah! We're going to get some real eggs!I've already set up some traps on the Raptor Rise up the path to the east. Take this bunch of wild clucker eggs and lay them in the traps. The spiny raptors will go right after the clucker eggs, and then you'll get to trade up to their larger eggs.Genius!"
4017,"Release the Valves : We have to stop Trade Prince Gallywix's oil supply and bring his machines to a grinding halt.We're going to need you to go out to the KTC Oil Platform and release the valves to overload the coolant system. After you do that, head to the platform control panel on the platform and set it to blow."
4018,"Reactivate the Constructs : We sent a number of our war constructs north into Needlerock Slag, but none of them ever returned. We know that the stone trogg mystics have done something to them.What we're concerned about is that the mystics will control and turn them against us, like they have with the fungal giants.<name>, go into the stone trogg town and reactivate the constructs."
4019,"Learning From The Past : Now that we finally have a hold on this wretched island, we can start to investigate how it got in this condition.  Some of our troops have discovered journals around the entrance to Cursed Depths cellblock just east of here.These journals are of particular interest to our elder scribes back at base camp.  I need you to recover four of them and bring them back to me as fast as you can.<name>, be careful down there, that place is crawling with undead."
4020,"The Lesson of the Sandy Fist : I'd like to observe you putting your new weapon to use, my young student. This will aid me in determining what degree of training will be best suited to your talents.We have many training targets in the training grounds below. Practice your attacks upon them, and return to me once you're feeling comfortable with your new weapon."
4021,"The Challenger's Fires : You're strong of mind and strong of will, but you lack the skills to face me in combat. You must fight with your body, but in truth, it is your character that is being tested.Let us even the playing field.Take this torch, light it in the brazier next to me, and then use it to light the three unlit braziers around the pool."
4022,"Raucous Rousing : You ready for this, <name>? I'm thinking maybe we should have looked for something to cover our ears, but it's a bit late for that now. Just remember that the intense ringing you'll be hearing for the next few hours is the ringing sound of victory!The honor's all yours, <name>. Ring the gong whenever you're ready!"
4023,"Get Our Stuff Back! : Our bombs and tools! Those sneaky monkeys to the east stole them all in the dead of night!Can you go out there and get them back for us, <name>? Without those tools, we have absolutely no way to get off of this island!"
4024,"Orcs Can Write? : Looking through the dead orc's belongings, you find a field journal. Though it is heavily water damaged, the writing is still legible, if barely.Flipping through the pages, an interesting story unfolds. Good thing you decided to study Orcish.Like the Trade Prince's yacht, the orcs were fired upon by Alliance warships. You do remember an orc warship that you passed right before the Alliance opened fire. Maybe they were firing on the orcs instead of your ship?Stupid orcs! They got you sunk!"
4025,"Evil from the Seas : I do not know what this evil is that is infesting the forest, <name>, but I know exactly how to deal with it. So do you, I think."
4026,"447 : We're close, but we still don't have enough macaroons. But, I've got a plan: we're going to collect on the headquarters insurance policy!Hope you don't mind, but I filled the place with the leftover fireworks from your party. All you have to do is go in there and sabotage things.Might I suggest the faulty generator, the leaky stove, and the flammable bed? Then, come back outside and use the control panel to send in the gasbot.It's a foolproof plan!"
4027,"Mystic Masters : The Needlerock mystics have taken control of the fungal giants that have sprouted in their chasm, down below. Now they seek to control our war constructs.Go north into Needlerock Slag and do something about it! Isn't that what you're here for?"
4028,"A Rock Amongst Many : <The ground trembles slightly, and the low, familiar voice of Diamant speaks as if from the stone itself.>You've done as I've asked.Turn back and escape the cave in one piece.Don't forget the gemstone."
4029,"Boosting Morale : Morale is low these days, <name>.  We make every effort we can to keep the troops in high spirits but we are running low on our main supply of morale booster... rum.I have been getting reports from our infantry to the south that the shipwrecks on the Cape of Lost Hope still have a good supply of southsea rum in their wrecked hulls.  Can you head up there and investigate?Bring back any rum you can find."
4030,"Mother's Malice : Unsurprisingly, their matriarch has taken offense to us taking her young to train for our own uses. It's understandable... and a bit tragic actually. We are very much the villains in this exchange.Now is not the time for such thoughts. These creatures are beings of fire, and on more than one occasion, they've claimed the lives of our kin. With their matriarch angered, the danger has grown immensely.I need someone to quiet her rage, and I fear you may be the most capable."
4031,"Teach A Man To Fish.... Or Steal : Rustberg Village.  That place is a curse and a blessing for us, <name>.  I have no clue where bandits learned to fish as well as they do but I have no time to worry about that now.I need you to head down there and steal as many of their fish reserves as possible.  We have been living off scraps since we retook the island and this is our best chance at some solid food reserves.Keep an eye out for stealthers up there, reports have told us they are prevalent inside the village walls."
4032,Bidden to Greatness : It is up to all of you to remove the thorn from the side of Shen-zin Su. Do not let your differences come between you. Trust in each other.Within the Pei-Wu Forest is a lone hermit. Head directly to his hut. He knows intimately of the dark things that now lurk in the trees.
4033,"Light at the End of the Tunnel : Okay, we have got to get out of here before she blows for good!Let's head out the other end of the tunnel on the north side of the mine. We should be able to use one of the mine carts for a quick ride down the side of the volcano."
4034,"Liberate the Kaja'mite : <Sir/Ma'am>, we need tons of moolah to pay the Trade Prince and get off Kezan! Well, tons of it is just waiting for the taking down there in the Kaja'mine!These are the last known deposits of kaja'mite anywhere. This is the raw stuff that made us the genius tinkerers and alchemists we are today. If that's not worth a bazillion macaroons, I don't know what is!Take some of my kablooey bombs and blowup the deposits. Then, pick up the chunks.Just watch out for the rebellious trolls!"
4035,"Close Escort : Alright, I think I've got it working again. You've got to get the catapult to the stone trogg town, Needlerock Slag, just to the north of the front.The driver will go with you. I'll head back and let Gravel know.There's no doubt that the stone troggs will try to stop you. You just keep them off of the catapult. It packs a big punch.Let me know when you're ready, <name>."
4036,"Swamp Bait : Supplies are never easy to find in a place like this, <class>.  We have been scouting since we captured the island but things are not looking good.Fortunately, we just  received a scouting report that a swamp full of crocs is just west of our base camp here.  The hides off those crocs will come in handy for our leatherworkers.  Bring back as many as you can."
4037,"First Lieutenant Connor : The first time I heard about Lt. Connor, I was just a young recruit in the Stormwind stockades.  None of us could believe he ended up here on Tol Barad.  Sadly, he still roams these wretched islands, wreaking havoc on our troops morale.I need you to put an end to his misery... and ours."
4038,"The Vicious Vale : Our hunter, Kilag Gorefang, and a few scouts, traveled into the vale down the path to the west. They're ...searching for... 'precious cargo'... that we were guarding when the filthy Alliance sunk our ship.The way is blocked by deadly plants and they have not been able to break through.<name>, prove your worth as a goblin and a <class>. Journey into the Vicious Vale to find Kilag."
4039,"Leave No Weapon Behind : Battle supplies are hard to come by on this rock.  Every time we hold off another Alliance attack, it feels like we are fighting with sticks and stones.Reports have come in that Keep Lord Farson on the north side of the island has a large stockpile of rifles that we could use.  Can you head down there and check it out?Be careful <name>, Farson's followers will do anything to protect him."
4040,
4041,
4042,"Not In the Face! : Alright <name>, I was thinking about what we'd try next if the whole gong thing didn't work, and it came to me just like that! Water in the face always worked on me. It's got to be twice as effective for someone so dry and earthy!Mind going over and asking Shu, the spirit of water, if he'll help us out?  He should be playing in the pool next to the waterfall, just on the other side of that tree."
4043,"Precious Cargo : They said that their ""precious cargo"", whatever that is, is being held out on the Alliance ship, the Vengeance Wake.There's only one thing to do... fly this thing out there and retrieve it!"
4044,Free the Captives : They've got a bunch of our people in there. I know that they're doing strange rituals to them. It looks like they're sucking the life force right out of them!You have to go into the village and free the captives before it's too late!
4045,"Children of a Turtle God : Volcanoth is the turtle god in the cave that these primitives worship.It's not really a god.<Hobart rolls his eyes.>But it is tough enough that I'm going to have to devise a new weapon for you from the one functioning boot we have left.I think that the age-old motto of ""fight fire with fire"" applies here. Plus, I like fire!Let's get some fire glands from Volcanoth's children. That should give me time to modify the rocket boot into something more fitting."
4046,"The Real Big Race : Here's the big one! Good luck out there!  This race has four legs: get to the purple post, then green, then red, then back here.   Your time matters, so do it fast!"
4047,"Life Savings : We've got all of the moolah that we need. There's only one thing left to do now, boss: get you to the Trade Prince's yacht. It's about to leave port!We're gonna have to hurry. Hop in, 'cause I'm driving!"
4048,"Necessary Roughness : We're down to our last shredder. While no one was looking, I loaded it up with, shall we say, modified footbombs.Kid, I need you to get in that shredder and give 'em heck!"
4049,"Making Things Crystal Clear : Among the Shuddering Spires are crystals. White, chalky crystals. We can absorb these crystals into our skin. To cleanse us. Purify us.I do not stride among the stones any longer. I am one with the earth. This carries many boons, but I can no longer retrieve the crystals for myself.Bring me the crystals that I might be stronger. Carry them away from the flayers. Away from my sons. This honor should be mine."
4050,"Fixer Upper : <Clay sneers at you and makes a sound much like two stones rubbing against each other.>They've smashed all of our catapults. I've been trying to get this one working, but no luck so far.Maybe you'd like to make yourself useful. Head out onto the front and grab me any spare parts you come across.You think you can handle that, flesh bag?"
4051,Unnatural Causes : This is most definitely magic in origin. Not even druidic. I suspect one among the stone troggs to the north.Go to Gorsik and point him in their direction. Hopefully this will help earn his favor.
4052,"Items of Utmost Importance : Amberleaf scamps swarmed my cart and stole most of the training supplies I was bringing up to the training grounds. They've always been troublemakers, but they've never been this aggressive before. I don't know what happened.Please, help me recover my supplies."
4053,"Small, But Significant : I am tired, <name>. I must rest.We have a ritual to perform, but we require some of the charms from this grove. If you wander the grove, you should see them all over hanging from the trees. If it does not offend one as young as you, will you permit me to sit and recover my strength while you gather these charms?"
4054,"Much to Learn : Fresh to your training, your first task is simple: Speak to Master Shang Xi."
4055,
4056,"Shatter Them! : I want you to go out there and I want you to finish them.Berserkers, Earthrenders, Deathriders... I don't care! I want those stone troggs shattered!"
4057,"Rocky Upheaval : To the east, on the Crimson Expanse, you will find Gorsik. He embodies the more unstable and violent nature of our kind. He is neither friendly, nor trusting, but his word carries weight.Proving yourself to Gorsik will go a long way towards proving yourself to the Stonemother."
4058,"Keep Them off the Front : Oh good, you brought another catapult with you! Clay might be older than dirt, but he makes a mean war machine.Well, you didn't bring it all the way out here for your health, flesh bag. Get in one of those things and bombard the fungal terrors and reinforcements streaming out of Needlerock Slag.We have to keep them off the front!"
4059,
4060,"The Fate of Runetotem : I apologize for speaking curtly with you earlier. The loss of Hamuul was shocking to me, and difficult to cope with.They brought in his body while you were away. He is alive, but - as you might imagine - he is very, very badly burned.The scars are deep. He may not live.I have arranged for some of our finest healers to attend to him. If it is not too much to ask, would you speak with Dorda'en Nightweaver? He and his fellow attendants may need your help."
4061,"Rattling Their Cages : We have been having issues with the undead down at the Cape of Lost Hope for a while now.  Every time a new ship wrecks, they end up getting more undead to join their ranks.Can you do us a favor and thin out the ranks up there?  I know you won't be able to kill them all, but anything you can do will help at this point.Keep an eye out for alliance, we have been getting reports of them ambushing the beach lately."
4062,"Claiming The Keep : Have you seen the keep on the north side of the island, <name>?  That is where Keep Lord Farson runs his operation from.Farson has a small group of dedicated followers and they have been giving us trouble since we got here.  We sent a small group to investigate and they reported back on his exact position within the keep.Can you finish him off for us?"
4063,
4064,
4065,"The Sting of Learning : There are dangers in the pools. The latest and most vicious are the water pincers. A time has come for their numbers to be diminished, and I am no longer up to the task.If you could clear out some of the water pincers, I would be very appreciative. Beware their numbers... sometimes it's best to lure them from the pool-side rather than wading all the way in."
4066,"Get Back to Town : We were wrong. It wasn't the naga that were preparing to attack... it was the nearby Oomlot tribe.<name>, you need to get back to the Town-In-A-Box. The pygmies are already attacking!Here, take this. We bought it off of a pygmy who said it used to belong to some great leader of theirs. Someone whose name translates as Dark Tan Helmet.It should fool them so that they don't attack you."
4067,"Loose Stones : The Twilight Cultists are taking my rocklings among them.  They drain them and torture them.  Strip them of the very essence that animates them from the stone.Please, <race>, free my rocklings. Neither Diamant nor I have the delicacy to smash their chains without hurting them as well.  But we do have a tool you might use.Use this. Break their chains and set them free."
4068,Gone Soft : The fungal behemoths that surround us have succumbed to a weakness very similar to that that affects your kind. Their skin has grown soft. They no longer belong with the stone.Kill them. We do not wish to see this infection spread.
4069,"Food From Below : Supplies are running low here in camp, <name>.  We have recently learned that the cellblock just southwest of here has a number of rations remaining from years of use.  We need you to gather as many of those as you can and bring them back to camp.One more thing, the entire cellblock is overrun with prisoners so be careful."
4070,"Steal Magmolias : We've discovered a new species of flower growing in the Magma Springs to the north. Amazingly, they sustain themselves in pure molten lava!Please go and retrieve some specimens for me. I'm sure that further study of these plants will shed some light on your little friend here.Speaking of which, he seems quite eager to go with you. Let's hope he behaves himself."
4071,The Dogs of War : Our forces are falling beneath an unleashed monstrosity - Charhounds from the molten depths.These dogs fear nothing and will not stop until their lust for blood is satisfied. Our forces are barely holding them back.Go join the defenders in the Ashen Fields or in the Molten Flow. Perhaps you can make a dent in their numbers.

We must help him face that fear, or face it for him ourselves.When I told Ji of the serpent, he said he had an idea and would begin preparations outside of the chamber. Despite his rash nature, I must admit, I envy his passion and conviction.Let us go outside and confront the Onyx Serpent."

You demolished the Steamwheedle Sharks, so now all that's left to do is to kick the winning goal.Now, just between you and me, I think we should do this one right. I don't want you to just kick a goal... I want you to kick it so far it sails between the two smokestacks behind the goal!I've modified the footbomb to give you the extra power that you'll need.Make me proud!"

It's your decision, <name>."
4078,

The rest of us will pack up here and move out soon.Just follow the path northwest through the Vicious Vale.

We found an abandoned cellblock just southwest of here and we need you to go check it out <name>.Reports have come back that it is overrun with prisoners that have been stuck down there for years.  Do whatever you need to do to clear that place out.  Report back to me when you are done."
4081,"Hounds of Shannox : On the Firelands' largest island, our troops have been having trouble against Shannox, the flamewaker hunter. Not only does he have impeccable aim, but he keeps trained hounds that give our troops no end of trouble.Tholo, in all his wisdom, thinks it would be a good idea to study the biology of these hounds. I, of course, agree with Tholo.You will find several hounds in the Molten Flow, beneath the Furnace. We will need their ashes to study."
4082,"Territorial Birds : The fire hawks are upset by our continued presence. They're getting extremely hostile, and not just in the usual territorial ways. I worry that if we leave them unchecked, they will soon be joining the assault on our tree, and I'm not sure we're capable of handling that.Go across the way to Fireplume Peak and do what you have to to keep them in check. I'm far more concerned with our safety right now than theirs, so be decisive about it."

They are the spawn of the vicious brood widow, Beth'tilac.Help us hold our line by clearing the area of Cinderweb Spinners or Cinderweb Creepers. It will drive her mad to see her children slain."

4093,
4094,"Spawn Tracking Unit-Specified World Effect in a WMO Bug : There seems to be a bug when you setup a world effect containing a gold dot on the minimap through Spawn Tracking that is set to Unit, rather than Objective. It seems to only happen with spawns inside WMOs. Might also be happening with setting it to Object as well.  If the Spawn Tracking on the World Effect is set to Objective, everything's fine. However, if it is set to Unit, the golden dot will not show up on the minimap."
4095,"Taking Care of Business : With all of the troubles down in the Kaja'mine, Foreman Dampwick's been going crazy trying to find you. He said something about some 'defiant trolls'.The kaja'mite that our trolls are mining is critical ingredient in Kaja'Cola. That bubbly stuff is making us a fortune, and it's going to get you a promotion to Trade <Prince/Princess>!But first, we have to get production flowing again. You'll find the foreman to the east. Here, give him this as an incentive to get his act together."

It makes me wonder from where they originate.Back to the point - I think we might be able to train them. Domesticate them if you will. Use them against our enemies.I'd like you to retrieve one of their eggs from the top of Fireplume Peak. If you can bring it back to me safely, I will see to the rest."

They hide and won't fight face-to-face.You goblins are known for your wondrous goggles. Surely you have a pair that will allow you to see them?I need you to team up with one of my scouts and kill any of the SI:7 assassins that you spot."
4101,"Help Wanted : Great news! Foreman Dampwick has uncovered a cave full of kaja'mite on the island! What are the odds?Of course, there's a downside. He took some of the survivors with him to help mine the ore, but none of them have made it out.Crazy as it sounds, the foreman said that there are monkeys in the cave... with mining picks! They're mining the kaja'mite! How is that even possible?Can you head southeast to the cavern? The foreman is standing just outside the entrance."

4103,"Monkey Advisory Warning : The monkeys have been stealing from the village during their attacks.

4106,"Escape Velocity : We really don't have time to rescue those that are incompetent enough to get themselves captured over and over. Still, since I have some extra rockets leftover, this problem should be a snap.Take these single-stage booster rockets down into the Slave Pits to the north and put them on the cages.The cage will lift off into orbit and those idiots will be freed."
4107,"Report for Tryouts : <name>, Coach Crosscheck is looking for you. He's the leader of our fearless footbomb team, the Bilgewater Buccaneers.He says that the division title against the Steamwheedle Sharks is on the line and that you're the only one that can bring it home for us!Head west into town.

4118,"Doomshrooms : The rift to your world has poisoned our home. Corrupted it. Polluted it.This expanse festers and grows. It becomes difficult to even see the purity of the rock beneath this filth.If you are here to lend your aid, then go about cleansing this overgrowth. Look for the brightly glowing mushrooms that are growing faster than the others. They are the worst of the offenders."
4119,"Embergris : The Crimson Lasher has developed some cracking blisters on its vines. Without treatment, this condition could be life threatening.Luckily, the Charred Soldiers and Charred Vanquishers in the area produce a waxy substance known as Embergris, which should soothe the Lasher's pain.Bring me some of this substance, and kill those nasty fire elementals while you're at it."

We need to put a stop to this!"

For my dedication, I was condemned to this stone form, forever forced to watch over a portion of his wealth.Someone has desecrated my glorious body and sent pieces of it across the island.

4136,"Round 'Em Up : Lok'tar, <class>.  We've made progress, but we're going to need mobility if we want to maintain our foothold here in Kun-Lai.  I don't see many worgs, kodo, or the like around here. What I do see are yaks. Our pandaren allies have said they make good mounts, so they'll have to do.

You see all of the Ironpaws at their cooking stations?Their tasty dishes draw many of the customers to this market, but they're all out of scallions!It may not look like much, but the scallion is an essential cooking ingredient.

You think you could help me?"
4140,"A Morale Victory : The mantid have statues built on Sra'vess. We don't know exactly what they use them for. They may have some sort of religious significance, or maybe they assist with their sonic communication.  When you fight your opponent, you don't just engage them physically, you also engage them mentally. Whatever they use them for, the fact is that those statues are important to them.  Which is why I want you to blow them up. Losing something important will be a substantial hit to morale."

You can be very convincing, right?"

We've come a long way, eh, Wodin?I tell you, there's nothing more these Tiger monks like than a good scrap.

If we can get rid of those weeds, we could use that land for planting.I heard there's a farmer by the name of Gai Lan who knows a thing or two about weed whackin'.His farm is just out west.

Grainfell? No, that wasn't it... Greedfill? That doesn't sound right...Greenfield! That's his name! He's the man to see for seeds.Greenfield's got a stall over at Halfhill Market, directly southeast of here - go see him and pick up some vegetable seeds."

4152,"Farmer Fung's Vote II: On the Loose : You want my vote for Farmer Yoon? Ha! You're joking, right?Listen, I'm not going to vote for some citypaw with no lick a' knowledge about farming the earth.It would be an embarrassment to farm alongside you or that Yoon shmuck.Now let me deal with my own problems. Some devil let my prize yaks loose, and now they're running wild northwest of Halfhill.If I could just get my yaks back, then maybe I'd be able to sleep at night."
4153,"Inherit the Earth : As you know, <name>, I'm getting along in my years. One can't stay a spry young pandaren forever, you know.I'm looking for someone to take over my duties here at the Tillers Union, and I can't think of a better person than Farmer Yoon.He's got a good deal to learn, but he's got a good head on his shoulders and most importantly, a generous heart.Do you think he'd be interested?"
4154,"Leaders Among Breeders : Before any kegs are tapped, we have work to do. These virmen are no different than the virmen on the Wandering Isle... a nuisance that breeds as fast as the rabbits they resemble.Sure, we could kill every last virmen we find, but what's the point in needless bloodshed? Let's just take out their alphas, and they'll slow down with their... reproduction."

I love him, but he's crazy.These yaungol managed to completely obliterate our ranch and scattered our yaks every which way.If I know my father though, he's going to try to go head to head with the yaungol to get the yaks back.Can you help us round up some of the yaks so my father doesn't do anything stupid?Just ride them over to the Yak Wash so we can clean them up and sell them to the grummles."

If you fish it right out - haha, get it? Fish? Oh I just crack myself up sometimes.Anyway, you bring me here some 'o that wood and then I'll get right to work!"

He works with Mr. Mudclaw out on the Mudclaw's farm to the northwest."
4169,"Growing the Farm II: The Broken Wagon : Hey <name>. I've been looking at that wagon every day, day in and day out, since the day I moved in. Quite an eyesore, don't you think?I heard in town that Fish Fellreed is quite handy with tools. She might be able to fix it up, and then we could turn that patch of land into a plot for farming.Why don't you talk to her and see if she'd be willing to do the job?"
4170,"Haohan's Vote II: The Real Culprits : What are YOU doing here, citypaw?Look, I've got my hands full with a break-in at my shed to the west. Some rascals came in the middle of the night and ransacked the place.I've got missing seeds, broken tools, and eaten inventory to deal with.I'll just add it to my list of other troubles: a whole wagon of melons stolen, a broken water pump, animals ruining my harvest...I wish that I could just get to the bottom of all this already!"

4179,"Xiao, the Eater : You may have already met my best student, Xiao, at the banquet tables. I personally would have graduated him several times over, but Instructor Xann insists that he needs more discipline.If you ask me, discipline means very little if you win every fight you enter. I'm curious to see if Xiao can keep his streak alive against you."
4180,"Learn and Grow III: Tending Crops : My grandfather used to say ""Yoonie, a cabbage is like a woman: ignore her and she'll turn rotten. Pamper her and she'll grow big and plump and you can put a ribbon on her and take her to market to show her off to your frie-"" look, he was from a different time, okay?The point is, now that our cabbages have sprouted, they need attention!

Many heeded my warnings and did not drink of the sha-tainted waters.They are in hiding, terrified, and intimidated by the guards.Please, tell them there is hope! Go into the village to the north.

4185,"A Gift For Jogu : Sometimes I feel sad for Jogu. He's the only jinyu around, and I don't think he has any friends. Other than his smelly bottle, of course.You know what? I've got an idea. Farmer Yoon has a basket of craneberries inside his house, and a few apples as well. I'm sure you could bring them to the stillmaster in the Halfhill Market and get him to brew something special for Jogu."

4190,Champions of the Swarm : It is clear that Shek'zara is fully committed to this invasion. Our scouts have spotted some of her greatest champions among the battlefield.

You've proven yourself, so we've decided to give this mission to you.  What's going to happen is this - you're going to go, find them, and kill them.

4202,"Temple of the White Tiger : Have you heard the news, traveller? There's been an attack at one of our most sacred places, the Vale of Eternal Blossoms!Even now, there's a human prince within the White Tiger Temple arguing that you and the other races from beyond the mists should be allowed within.The temple is in the northeast of Kun-Lai.

Completely different color and dress to him, like some kind of... oracle or something.

Check it out?"
4207,"Last Piece of the Puzzle : These hozen are behaving most unnaturally, <name>. Marching in formation? In armor?This troubles me. We must discuss it at another time, however. I have come to ask for your assistance.The ancient fresco, where last we spoke, is nearly unveiled. I am certain that it holds ancient wisdom - knowledge that the emperor wanted us to remember.My meditations alone may not be enough to discern its meaning. Please, take this heirloom to the shrine of my ancestors. I shall require their assistance."
4208,"Tears in the Vale : As N'Zoth's influence spreads within the Vale, our very reality begins to break down.   The Old God's power has created tears in the fabric our world, acting as doorways for his minions to invade from his dark realm.  As long as these tears exist, we will never be free from N'Zoth's grasp. Close them, and stem the tide of his corruption!"
4209,"In the House of the Red Crane : ""Broken are the bodies wherein hopeless hearts reside - the blight of despair strikes forth from inside.""This was the last piece of wisdom the Red Crane imparted to me, just hours before the Sha outbreak.  It makes sense now...$p, when the Sha attacked, they broke forth from the temple's basement...All of his teachings - the very Way of the Crane itself... it's all been preparation for facing the Sha of Despair.The Red Crane has been expecting this conflict for centuries!"

And to make matters worse, they claim to serve the legendary Captain Ook!We see them every night partying and brewing punch on their island Unga Ingoo. I say we take their brew for a change! I think I can even improve their mix.Gather up some friends and meet me on the southern side of Unga Ingoo. It is time for a Brew Run!"
4213,The Burlap Trail: To Burlap Waystation : Bad fortune for grummles today. Hozen have begun to ravage! They attack our supply line to the Serpent's Spine.Can you help? We are not fighters. We are grummles. Good fortune to those who help grummles.Go with a group of grummles to the Burlap Waystation. Keep them safe. Make sure at least one grummle survives.Grummles shall reward. Grummles always reward.
4214,"Cashing Out : I just saw one of the Sunreavers - Brasael, I think his name was - running off in the direction of the bank to the north. No doubt he's trying to gather whatever assets he can before he leaves.Head him off and make sure he doesn't steal any resources from our coffers. He relinquished whatever funds he left in the bank when he and his Sunreaver kind betrayed us."

Emerging from the mists, far off the coast of the Jade Forest - an island that was lost in time!It is a dangerous place, perhaps the most perilous in all of Pandaria.

4218,"The King and the Council : I am glad you are here, <name>. I have been using my dream brew to experience events around the world, but the more I learn, the more confused I become.For instance, King Wrynn has asked the dwarves of Ironforge for more troops, but they do not all support him.I will tell you more, but I would also like to hear from your experience firsthand..."
4219,"A Timeless Question : Destiny. Fate. Karma. Words like these imply that the timeways are unassailable.Would that were the case. To this day, many of Azeroth's inhabitants yearn to change the past. Yet just as our experiences shape us, they also shape the world around us.Consider how those threads have woven the fabric of today's reality. Cut enough threads, and causation inevitably fails, unraveling that fabric. Indeed, cutting even a single thread short can result in disaster, provided it is the right thread."

You, take this cannon and ride Mishi.You must find a way to contain this horror that has been unleashed!"
4222,"A Celestial Experience : The human calf is arguing on our behalf. He is well-spoken; I can see why Baine Bloodhoof regards the prince so highly.Still, the argument does not go well. I am of little consequence, but you are a hero of the Horde. Perhaps you can intercede in our favor?Speak with the White Tiger and plead our case, <race>.Be careful! He may set a number of challenges before you..."
4223,"The Farmer's Daughter : Brave <class>, you could not have arrived at a better time. My daughter is missing!I've got a suspicion that the virmen took her down into that stinking little warren of theirs.

4225,"The Scale-Lord : The saurok at the Lake of Stars take their orders from their Scale-Lord, a vicious, merciless leader who guards his territory fiercely.If we can eliminate this leader, then we can gain access to the enormous amber lode beneath the lake.Go. Their leader gives his orders from his underground dwelling, at the southern edge of the lake."
4226,"Fires and Fears of Old : We've found the blades, bound them together with wood and shade, and blessed them with an ancient incantation. If I'm not mistaken, it's time to use this thing.The sprites spoke of an ancient piece of sap within the Amber Hibernal, a mantid cave near their empress' palace. That must be the ""Blood of Ancients"" that the prophecy spoke of.Whatever's inside that sap must be important. Good luck, <name>."
4227,"Better Off Dread : It's time we go to the source, <name>!Shado-Pan marksmen keep a constant watch over the Dread Wastes from the top of the Serpent's Spine.

4228,"Wood and Shade : ""Rending daggers of the great ones shall be bound with WOOD and SHADE.""  Hmm.I've learned a lot about the Kor'thik mantid in my time here. I know that they maintain shrines within their settlement, Kor'vess.One is a heartroot of the very tree that they inhabit. The other is a dark pillar, connecting them with their queen.These shrines are the wood and shade. If my predictions are right... the daggers should react in their presence."
4229,"The Motives of the Mantid : <class>. You may be of assistance.The Shado-Pan wishes to know why the mantid are attacking so violently. We have our suspicions, but we cannot be sure. Furthermore, we do not want the mantid to know that we are investigating them.That's where you come in.I need you to kill the mantid of Kri'vess, in the north. I will lurk behind you in the shadows, and search for clues on their bodies."
4230,"Dropping Our Signal : The beacon in Amberglow Hollow seems to have been tampered with. Right before the signal cut out the Klaxxi'va picked up a signal for another paragon nearby.They believe he is hidden in that wretched little swamp, Duskroot Fen.I will meet you in the fen to set up a temporary beacon until I can get Amberglow operational again.You will wake the paragon and then you will help me."
4231,"Rampage Against the Machine : Kovok has progressed at an astonishing rate. Perhaps the years in hibernation effected his growth process...Whatever the reason, this could not have come at a better time. I believe it is time to test his abilities.You have done so much to aid in his training. It is only fitting that you assist him in his first battle.I've already guided him to the edge of the scar. Find him and destroy Shek'zeer's army!"

Use the flare launcher to bring in the fleet proper, and begin Operation: Shieldwall."
4234,"A Vision in Time : Look at how the Vision reacts! Astounding! Even now it shows shadows of timeways that flit around us constantly. Though not true sands of the Hourglass of Time, the finely-ground epoch stones certainly have a power all their own. Our first task is to use them to calibrate the Vision of Time.Take the Vision of Time to a location where history is in the making: the Siege of Orgrimmar. Once there, turn the hourglass and see what happens."
4235,"The Might of the Warchief : Come, <class>! I want to inspect this island and ensure that my landing team has done their job.Blood Guard Gro'tash should be somewhere on the northern side of the island looking for a suitable place to build our keep. The goblin survey team will have gone up the eastern coast in search of oil.Let us crush this pitiful display and claim this land for the Horde!"
4236,"Father's Footsteps : Yes, the boy's father - Sentinel Ku-Yao - has gone missing. He could be any number of places... we have no shortage of enemies these days.You're free to look around, if you wish. You might start by looking for his yak, or by asking Sentinel Yalo what he knows."
4237,"Shadow of the Empire : You only understand part of our order. You are an outsider, and have been treated as such.It is no longer appropriate that we keep our secrets from you. There is something you should see."
4238,"A Flash of Bronze... : As you survey the devastation of the vale, a flash of bronze catches your eye. Unless you're mistaken, a tiny gnome is trying to catch your attention from the balcony above Mogu'shan Palace, just outside of the Seat of Knowledge.You should see what she wants."
4239,"Unmasking the Yaungol : Simply killing Kobai will accomplish nothing, as he is possessed by a particularly powerful and destructive Sha - Malevolent Fury.  You will use the trap I have fashioned from the Blinding Rage Essences you brought. Lure him into the trap, and then steal his mask. Once you put it on, Malevolent Fury will appear and attempt to take control of you.  Defeat him, and we will have made a victory of this tragic situation. You can find him to the north of the retreat, where he taunts us in insane rage."
4240,"The Archiereus Of Flame : Your efforts have driven back the Ordon and brought peace to the Celestial Court, but it will not last. It is time to silence the great emissary of Ordos - the Archiereus of Flame.Speak with Mistweaver Ku and purchase a scroll of challenge, then travel to Three-Breeze Terrace to the north. Issue a challenge at the challenge stone, it will undoubtedly catch the attention of the Ordon, drawing the archiereus out of the Ordon Sanctuary. It is your only chance."

Perhaps you will join me, and we can both be satisfied?Oh, but I am getting old, and this blizzard is proving too much for my bones. Could you climb ahead and anchor this rope? I can hoist myself along from there.Together we shall walk the path of the last emperor."
4248,"Great Minds Drink Alike : Hello again, <name>. What is this, the fourth time we've run into one another already?Say... my keg is quickly becoming quite empty. I've heard mention of a brewery to the southwest, and that's where we're headed. Care to join us?"

Then we will give you - and your Shado-Pan associate - the answers you seek."
4252,"Warforged Seals : Greetings, <name>. I am privileged to offer you an excellent opportunity. Through the centuries, we've honed a method by which the very laws of chance themselves can be bent.

You must go to the lake and test the tribe's strength. Thin their numbers and eliminate their leader, who is probably hiding in his underground cavern.Surely this is not too great a task for you?"

We have learned of an enormous army, massing in the shadows of the Heart of Fear, with orders to crush Klaxxi'vess.We have been fortunate to hold out this long, but we cannot survive a siege of this scale.Wakener, you have been invaluable to our efforts. Come, take your place on the field among we paragons.I will see you on the battlefield!"
4259,"Drive Back The Flame : The pandaren once existed in harmony with the Ordon yaungol. When the island suddenly disappeared, the Ordon faced certain death. In their desperation, the chief shaman called out for aid to the Fire Lords, and was answered.Ordos was his name. Now, he is a creature of anger and violence.

4263,"Blood of Ancients : Lya and I agree on one thing: ""Blood of Ancients"" is almost certainly the sap from the great trees of the area. I should know - I brew with the stuff all the time.The most ancient tree of all is the one that Grand Empress Shek'zeer calls her home, now known as the Heart of Fear. Find some amber from that tree, and our brew should be complete."
4264,"Chen and Li Li : My niece and I are new to Pandaria. Probably like yourself. We're visitors from the Wandering Isle, and, to be honest, we have no idea where we're going.That farm up ahead looks as fine a place as any to take off our shoes and enjoy a brew. What do you say, Li Li?<race>? Would you like to share the road with us?"
4265,"Champions of the Thunder King : This island is riddled with lurking threats from three powerful groups, waiting for the chance to pounce on us. Masters of lightning, ancient and powerful spirits, and primal Zandalari monstrosities.If you can get your hands on some of the Shan'ze Ritual Stones scattered across the isle, you should be able to beckon these powerful opponents out of hiding and strike out at them.Find and destroy members of each group to keep them destabilized, and I will make it worth your time."
4266,"Path of the Mistwalker : You have heard the words of the celestials, but what did you learn on your path to the shrines?The wisdom of the pilgrimage is in its silence and simplicity. As you listen to the wind rustling in the trees, and note even the smallest butterfly, your mind is open to learning the deepest lessons the trials have to teach us. Perhaps you noticed the many great beasts that roam the island?Therein lies your trial. You have learned much from Pandaria, now let us put your knowledge to the test."
4267,Extending Our Coverage : The Klaxxi'va hear another paragon. His cries are weak and lost in darkness. The signal must be strengthened.There is a tower in Amberglow Hollow that has been silent for many years. It must sing; the Klaxxi demand it!This time I will go with you. You will help me repair it.Take the resonating crystal and meet me in Amberglow.
4268,"The Enemy of My Enemy... Is Still My Enemy! : The mantid are our enemies. As are the yaungol at Fire Camp Gai-Cho.  It is fortunate, then, that they are also each other's enemies. Mantid from Kri'vess constantly attack the Gai-Cho yaungol, who hold them off at their front gates.  I want you to wreak havoc. ""Borrow"" some highly explosive oil barrels from camp Gai-Cho, and toss them down onto the battlefield from the air.  I don't care which ones you kill, just kill a lot of them."
4269,"Wild Things : Welcome to the Order of the Cloud Serpent, <race>. I can see from the spark in your eye that you wish to join the Order.Let me get a good look at you.<Elder Anli gently holds your head and gazes at your face.>Hmm. I see honesty and earnestness in your heart. You have journeyed far to come here, but I am afraid you must go yet further.Your path into the Order begins now.Speak to Instructor Tong at Windward Isle to the northeast to take the first step."
4270,"Oh Sheepie... : Sigh... you guessed it... Sheepie is gone... AGAIN.Stupid sheep! Gives me so much trouble!I hate to ask you again, but I promise this will be the last time.Can you find him for me?"
4271,Lessons from History : The Thunder King was a vicious Emperor and with the Zandalari at his side he was unstoppable. His return would surely return this land to turmoil and misery.You must locate his remains and take them somewhere safe. The Tablet of Thunder should help you figure out how to access his tomb.
4272,"Debugging the Terrace : If this Empress is truly possessed by fear and paranoia, she will have sent scouts to every corner of the land in order to cement her control.These scout grubs are likely everywhere, but difficult to spot with the naked eye. Better to track them by the pheromone trails they leave behind.I've already... gifted you... a reactive toxin that will reveal these trails to you for a brief time after experiencing the thrill of victory.Go now to the Terrace of Gurthan and root out these spies."
4273,"Water, Water Everywhere : How'd you like to make yourself useful?The season's been awful dry lately. I need someone to water the crops out in the Heartland. Here's the thing: I need you to water ALL of the crops.I keep a few kites with Wing Nga, the flightmaster across the way. Grab one of those kites, then throw water on any areas that look dry and dusty."
4274,Uruk! : Uruk is the Deadtalker of the Townlong yaungol. Your mission will not be truly complete until you defeat him. Go to it!
4275,"Buried Hozen Treasure : The map you hold is crinkled, dirty, and poorly drawn, but you can see a big X on a beach.Is there buried treasure somewhere on this island?"
4276,Survival Ring: Blades : This is one of the challenges I put upon my warriors to keep them strong and fast. Let's see how you fare.Survive the ring for 60 seconds without getting pushed out or killed. Stay on your toes.
4277,"Trial At The Temple of the White Tiger : Xuen, the great Celestial of the North, seeks the greatest champions in the land.Today, he holds trials of battle at his temple in Kun-Lai Summit.If you wish to test yourself against skilled fighters from all across Pandaria, then go to him and enter the challenger's ring!"
4278,
4279,A Witness to History : I will gather up the other Tauren pilgrims and we will travel into the Vale together.Meet me at the Gate of the August Celestials at the southern edge of Kun-Lai Summit and speak with me there.
4280,"Secrets in the Isle of Thunder : I do have one thing I would ask of you, <class>.We've gotten our hands on a powerful ritual stone that the Shan'ze mogu use to beckon their allies into battle, but we need more than one to perform their rituals.If you come upon three of these stones, bring them back to me. We can gather our forces and use these stones to beckon some of Lei Shen's most powerful servants directly into our traps."
4281,"The Last Emperor : From what I have gathered, this place used to be a tournament ground of sorts, where warriors from throughout Pandaria would show their prowess by following in the footsteps of their last emperor, Shaohao.I have heard that when Shaohao completed his trials, he became one with the land, and enveloped Pandaria in a thick mist, obscuring it from even our abilities to penetrate the passages of time.That sounds quite interesting, perhaps you should speak with him?"
4282,Blanche's Boomer Brew : Can you smell it in the air? A storm is brewing! And so am I!Meet me at the hilltop when the storm hits and together we'll whip up a keg of my most famous brew. Can I count on your help?
4283,"Overthrone : The council is in harmony, wakener.Our ritual will bring about the demise of the empress and allow us to secure the future of our great empire.Behold the power of the Klaxxi!"
4284,"Falling Down : It's bad enough trying to hold off the mantid, but now we've got spiders swarming up from the ruins below.One of my best marksmen caught a blast of webbing around his leg and got pulled straight down!We think he's alive, but I don't have the manpower to send anyone in after him. We're stretched thin up here, <class>.If you want to help, use the rope behind me to drop down into the ruins. You're not afraid of heights are you?How about spiders?"
4285,
4286,"Zhu's Despair : Hmm... Is that Yi-Mo kid over there?<Ken-Ken squints against the increasing torrents of rain.>It is! He's at the well, and he's not lookin' so good.Ken-Ken got a bad feeling about this..."
4287,"Stealing Their Thunder King : Our only hope is to find the Thunder King's remains before they do. He must be buried within the Tomb of Conquerors.Getting to his remains will not be easy, <name>. The tomb will no doubt be defended by guardians and other unfriendly surprises intended to ward off thieves.Once inside we will need to figure out where his remains have actually been placed."
4288,"Mission: Culling The Vermin : I was sent to this valley to protect The Heartland from any potential threats.I've identified a high priority target. The Springtail vermin burrow into the mountain cliffs, high above the farmlands.Left unchecked, their numbers will multiply, and they will make their way down to the fields below.They must be eliminated."
4289,"Falling to Pieces : Why would the saurok have amber? More importantly, why would Oracle Hiss'ir be so protective of it?It is unlikely this came from the heavily guarded Zan'vess, so where did it come from?Perhaps the Klaxxi will know what to make of it."
4290,"The Horror Comes A-Rising : We are protected from the mantid. Such was the agreement made so many millennia ago.There are forces from which we are not safe, however. The kyparites beneath the ground to the west will haunt us, chase us... even eat us. The mistlurkers eat our kind by the handful.Help our people, outsider. Defeat our enemies."
4291,"The Storm Gathers : There is no time to waste, <name>. Every moment we delay here gives the Sunreavers more of a hold on the Isle.Lady Jaina Proudmoore awaits us. We should not make her wait any longer.Speak to me when you are ready to depart. I will escort you there myself."
4292,"The Sky Race : The time for the great race is upon us!Traverse the course among the spires and pass through the checkered flags on each of the 10 balloon checkpoints.Make sure to pass underneath the finish line when you are done.The competition will be fierce, but I wish you luck. Speak to me when you are ready to begin."
4293,"Tian Monastery : People come from all over Pandaria to train at the Tian Monastery, just to the north of here. Probably because they never turn anybody down. They'll accept jinyu, hozen... or even a foreign <race> like you!My childhood friend, Lin, just joined the monastery's order a few weeks ago. If you're interested in learning how our monks train, maybe you should go talk with her!"
4294,"The White Pawn : Alright, soldier. I've got a critical mission for you.  Get down to the coastline south of here - in the cove there you'll find a wrecked Alliance vessel. I need you to search it and find out if it was the ship that was carrying Anduin.   Then, recover the Captain's Log and see if it has any information on where we can find him.  Since the log is from a military ship, it'll be written using a cipher - take it to Nodd Codejack afterwards. He's keeping watch on the wreck from the other end of the cove."
4295,"Call Out Their Leader : Clearly, you are a hero come to aid us.Slay the Bataari Tribe in the Kun-Lai Pass to the northwest until the Bataari Fire-Warrior is angered enough to appear.  Dispatch him."
4296,Lightning Steel : Your trained eyes can see that this metal ingot has some very strange properties. Perhaps there are clues to its nature somewhere around here?
4297,"Dawn's Blossom : Blood and Thunder! My axe hungers!We won't return to Orgrimmar until every last Alliance is purged from this land.I will train these natives myself, if I have to. One way or another, this land will be made ready for Horde settlement.In the meantime, their chief gave me this to pass on to you - a map and a message in some fancy script.Do what you must, but be quick about it.War is brewing..."
4298,"The Wrath of Shek'zeer : The rest of the freed paragons are scattered around the Heart of Fear, fighting off the mantid swarm. They may need your help!"
4299,The Final Blow! : We've learned that their captain has barricaded himself in above us.The coward allowed his forces to die while he hid from our fury! Typical Alliance! No matter. He cannot delay his fate any longer.I will scale the walls with my marines while you lead a frontal assault up the ramps. Use your flare gun on munitions near the barricades to blast your way through.We will meet you up top and destroy this pathetic excuse for a captain together!
4300,"First Assault : Now that we have had time to assess our enemies' weaknesses, it is time for us to deal the yaungol a direct blow.Go and confront the Osul Sharphorn up the mesa to the west.Let them know that we are here, and that we are not scared of their threats."
4301,"Catch! : <The hatchling looks up at you with a bored, listless expression.>You have a feeling the serpent is tired of being cooped up all day. How about playing a little game of catch?"
4302,"The Jade Serpent : You came to deliver a message to the Jade Serpent, right?<The little girl tilts her head up at you inquisitively.>I guess it's time you met her."
4303,"No Pack Left Behind : The Broketooth hozen south of here killed all of my grummles. What is worse, their packages are undelivered.Fortune frowns on a grummlepack undelivered.Please, give my grummles peace on the great trail of beyond and bring their grummlepacks to me.I will see they are delivered."
4304,"A Lesson in Bravery : <Master Shang speaks to his shepherd boy.>Francis, you need to show bravery! You have everything it takes to make a great shepherd, except the courage to face your fears!<He looks over to you.>You, stranger. You helped the rest of my family. Francis is like a second son to me.Show my apprentice what it means to lack fear. Use this rope to lasso and defeat one of the great white hawks above us.<Shang points to the sky, looks at Francis, and leaves.>"
4305,"Corrupted Curiosities : I understand that the Black Empire poses a grave threat to Pandaria, but we may also use this as an opportunity!  Though we've faced them several times before, very little is known about the Old Gods or N'Zoth's mysterious realm of Ny'alotha.   When studying ancient civilizations, we often rely on artifacts to unlock the deepest mysteries lost to time. I wonder if some such artifacts could be found among the Old God's forces?  It can't hurt to check, right?"
4306,"The Fall of Shai Hu : I can hear the voice of the Mere - it has been purified.  But, this chapter in my people's history will never be closed - not until we defeat Shai Hu.  He has retreated to the central island in the Mere, corrupting our holiest of sites.  Beware - he is strong. But, after all we have done, I am confident we will be stronger."
4307,"Great Vessel of Salvation : I know what you and the girl-panda seek. We can perform the rite for you... in time.First, I require aid. The seeds fall from our great mother-tree. It is our responsibility to collect them, even in dangerous times like these.Escort my chanters to the motherseeds, that they may bring them back to the collection pit."
4308,"Old Man Thistle's Treasure : Well high golly! This is turning into a real life treasure hunt!There's gotta be some kind of entrance or opening to the north, where the mountains meet Cattail Lake.I'll meet ya at the entrance! Let's go get that treasure!"
4309,"Kung Din : I hope you are capable of this next task, for our lives depend on it.There is only one key that will unlock our chains. Unfortunately, the key hangs around the neck of the hozen's pet tiger, Kung Din.They keep the tiger in the great pit to the north. The only way to retrieve the key will be to kill the beast."
4310,"The Thunder Below : Roars have been echoing out from inside the Guo-Lai Halls. The mogu have awakened some ancient beast, and it will not be long before they attempt to release it upon my men.Find your way to the Hall of the Serpent and slay the beast before it can be unleashed upon us. I would trust no other with such a dangerous and important task."
4311,"Feed or Be Eaten : After years of working with the Kunchong I developed a theory; raising one from infancy would strengthen the bond and therefore strengthen the sonic connection.I had just begun training Kovok when I was chosen for encasement. He is still very young and will need diligent training to reach his full potential.I'm entrusting Kovok to you, but be warned; if any harm comes to him your life is forfeit.First, you must feed him to gain his trust. The turtles in the area should be suitable for this."
4312,"The Fall of Ga'trul : Alright <lad/lass>. We've taken enough jabs at this warlock army... now it's time to cut off the head.Ga'trul's back there, in that big ol' temple ruin. Give him a good what-for, and the Horde will have lost its last stake here in Pandaria."
4313,"Wayshrines Of The Celestials : Many years ago, these grounds were a place where my people would come in pilgrimage. Here, they would listen to the words of the celestials, and meditate for many days. In their meditations, they found the fear, anger, despair, doubt, and violence that plagued their spirits.Before them would be a pathway to enlightenment. For each, the pathway would be different. For all of them, the pathway began with wisdom.Travel the island, as they did, and discover one of the lost wayshrines of the celestials."
4314,"The Defense of Shado-Pan Fallback : I sent for reinforcements from the Shado-Pan Monastery, but have heard nothing back. We have already lost the town.  A few lucky villagers may have survived, but we are pinned down here.  We do not have time to entertain strangers. If you can fight, help my men defend this tower. If not, leave, for you will not survive long here."
4315,"Li Li's Day Off : Uncle Chen asked me not to get into any fights while he was away... but that doesn't mean I can't go exploring. Finally, a chance to look around Pandaria without stopping every forty-seven steps for another rest!You want to come with me? I'll bet there's all kinds of cool places we can visit, not too far away from here."
4316,"Skin of the Saurok : Ihgaluk Crag is a dangerous place. Luckily, you have the magic of the Sunreavers behind you.I can transform you into a saurok.I will perform the first half of the illusion on you now. Afterwards, you should go directly to Ihgaluk Crag and slay one of the Skumblade saurok. Once you have done this, I will contact you and complete the second half of the illusion."
4317,"A Foot in the Door : <Lord Taran immediately pins you down with his steely gaze.><class>, you bear the marks of many a past battle.Good! We need more seasoned people like you to hold back the front.We've managed to secure a foothold here, but the yaungol are desperate to remove our presence.If you wish to prove your worth, go down the hill and show the yaungol that we will not back down."
4318,"Revelations : The prisoner is being kept upstairs, <name>. It will be difficult to get information from him, but even the slightest detail about their location will help.The elders have begun questioning him already. With their help we should be able to figure out our next move.Go speak with him and see if he has any useful information."
4319,"Flames of the Void : Do you see the violent black and white flames erupting all around the temple?The greater our doubt, the stronger they rage. Unchecked, they will devour the entire temple.We have but one hope.Take flight on one of our war serpents. Fly it near the pure springs of water, and then douse the fires with water from the pools."
4320,"A Timeless Tour : You should first familiarize yourself with the island.Explore. Investigate anything that catches your interest. Return when you're done, and I'll reward you for whatever information you've gathered about this strange place.And do be careful! Monstrous beasts and supernatural creatures abound."
4321,"Do a Barrel Roll! : When I trained as a Brewmaster, I didn't expect to use my knowledge like this...  Did you know beer catches fire when lit? Well, with yaungol oil mixed in, it's downright explosive.  I've mixed the oil in with these kegs. Roll them at the yaungol over by the gate, and ignite them when you get close.   It'll take a few seconds for the keg to blow, but when it does...  Well, let's just say I wouldn't want to be over there.  Which is why I'll be over here. Mourning the loss of this brew."
4322,"Stirred, Not Shaken : Alright, I'll tell you how to find Connelly.Agent Connelly is currently posing as the high roller, Professor Kilt. He spends most of his time in the Boom Room. Rumor has it he's after one of the fighters for some long forgotten betrayal.Unfortunately, the lounge is by invitation only. Lucky for you I just happen to have an invitation.Try not to look too obvious when you walk past the bouncers. If you get caught you didn't get this pass from me.In fact you and I have never met!"
4323,"On the Crab : I just got word that a string of pots we dropped this morning hit it BIG. We're on the crab!Problem is, the rips are getting stronger and we lost track of some of the pots. They're just sitting out there, filled with spiky blue GOLD!I need you back out there. Hook one of these buoys up to any of the full traps you find and send it to the surface for us."
4324,"The Darkness Within : You didn't see Captain Doren while you were out there, did you?That sniveling Alliance leader must be in hiding somewhere. If he wasn't in that airbase, he can't be far. Search the perimeter - try searching the cave southwest of the main airfield. I want the Alliance gone from here!"
4325,"The Burlap Grind : Alright, it's time to take Kota Kon out for her ""walk.""We brewed two fresh pots of kafa just for her and she's all fueled up!"
4326,Rise Of An Empire : Warchief Garrosh Hellscream travels north with a squad of his most elite soldiers.Report to him with news of our continued victory against the Alliance.Speak to Tak-Tak for transportation.
4327,"Strong Enough To Survive : An island lost in time and yet it returns flourishing with life!Where did this island travel to? Did it simply hop forward in time, or did it languish in the dark reaches of the Twisting Nether?There is one thing for certain: the creatures that inhabit this place are far more than they seem. I sense a hidden power in them, forged by the eons. Seek out the champions of their species, duly marked by their power and prowess, and vanquish five such creatures.In death, we may find the clues we seek."
4328,"Infection : The Empress's genemancers play with dangerous toys.To the south, they are injecting local wildlife with pheromone-laden parasites, in an attempt to create monstrous mutations for war.Carelessly, they have allowed their parasitic worms to escape into the local ecosystem.Left unchecked, the infection will spread from one animal to another, until we have an outbreak.I will inject you with a mild toxin. With it, you will be able to identify infected creatures.Kill the carriers at once."
4329,"The Perfect Color : As you have seen, this grove is abundant with beautiful pink petals.  As each petal ages, the tone deepens and fades.If you would be so kind, I am in need of a few petals that have freshly fallen.  Only the ones that have just fallen will have precisely the right color I am after.From it I can forge an ink that will be breathtaking.  Can you help me?"
4330,"Unbelievable! : I simply refuse to believe the guards will not grant us entry to the monastery should we impress upon them the seriousness of the situation.  Friend, go east, to the sentinel in front of the Monastery, and demand admittance. I will come with you."
4331,"The Scent of Blood : I'm afraid that I wet my hands with saurok blood while you were away.I'm sorry, but I could not help myself. Now, watch them attack me.Pitiful!Do they think to take vengeance for their fallen? Do they come challenge ME?I, who have won a hundred wars? I, who stood alone against thousands and still shouted for my enemies to come?No, these... saurok... will crumple before me like paper before the flame!I shall show you my might, Wakener. Fight alongside me and see.Here they come!"
4332,"An Urgent Plea : <Your mind is racked with a howl. Beneath it, a wispy voice is barely audible, as if from far away.>Please... help... heart of the ruins... a ritual... conjuring......should not be here...My staff... on the altar... take it. Please hurry."
4333,"Challenge At The Temple of the Red Crane : The Temple of the Red Crane still reels from the aftermath of the sha's presence, and has only recently gathered to rebuild and retrain its warriors.If you wish to help at the temple, speak to Thelonius at the Cradle of Chi-Ji."
4334,"Back in Yak : I wasn't lying about your reward. Here, take these washed yaks to the grummle caravan master Eightcoins.You can find him at the Grummle Bazaar west of here. He'll credit us and give you a delivery fee.He may be short, but he is our biggest customer.Return to me if you lose the yaks. More often than not they just come right back here anyway. Once they've been cleaned that is."
4335,"Into the Wilds : Deep in the wilds, on the southern coast where the Krasarang River meets the sea, rests the Temple of the Red Crane, home of the great Chi-Ji and his most devout followers.They should be told of what happened here.If you're headed that way, I have a favor to ask; We often send supplies to the temple, but our last courier has not returned. Please look for signs of him as you travel - where the road forks at the Dojani River, he'd have gone south. When you reach the temple, find Koro Mistwalker."
4336,"Reflections in Amber : <A viscous dark ooze drips from this large chunk of amber. Attempting to wipe it off is futile, as the ooze is seemingly created by the amber itself.  As you hold it, unintelligible whispers fill the back of your mind.  The Shado-Pan will surely want to examine it.>"
4337,"The Heavens Hum With War : The mantid don't ever make my job easy, but now they've gone too far.We can fend off the occasional attack from Kor'vess, but now... now they're starting to surround us. What's worse, they're draining the amber from our tree.This will not stand! We need that amber! To make beer!They've dug a burrow into the south side of the tree. I'm short-handed here. Could you take care of them for me?"
4338,"Finish Them! : We've softened them up. Now it's time to finish them off!That fortress must be cleansed of Alliance, and we've got nowhere to keep any prisoners.<The hint of a smile crosses Nazgrim's face.>You know what to do, <name>. The cowards will run if you give them the chance.See that you don't!"
4339,"Beyond the Wall : We received word the Shado-Pan have begun a counter attack in to Townlong Steppes. It sounds like they are going after the root of the yaungol invasion.The pandaren have not traveled in force in to Townlong for thousands of years. The Shado-Pan are strong and brave, but they are also proud and few. They will need help from heroes like yourself. Can you travel through the Gate of Winter's Blossom in the northwest? Find the Shado-Pan leaders and lend your help and experience?"
4340,Cleansing the Mere : Pools of the same murky substance that came out of Mei emerged in the lake recently.  I will travel into the Mere with you. Point out the pools of corruption that you are ready for me to cleanse.  You will need to deal with whatever comes out and protect me as I complete the ritual.
4341,"The Root of the Problem : Kypari Zar is dying.A creature of terrible darkness corrupts it from deep beneath its roots.The tree cannot be saved, but at least we can lessen its pain.Look. The vile creature has carved a path to its own lair. We need only follow it down the hill, just behind this tower."
4342,"The Point of No Return : One of our rangers reported seeing Suna up the hill to the northwest.I am relieved to find her safe. I had feared what she would do in her grief.Would you go speak to her on my behalf?Take this totem with you. If you encounter any danger along the way, you may find it useful."
4343,"Boom Goes the Doonamite! : It's an emergency!Looks like you stirred up a hornet's nest killin' all them fish-folk.They're conductin' a full-on counterattack on Grookin Hill!I was hopin' to get some R&D time, but we're gunna hafta put my methane-grenade theory to work right away!Meet me on the east side of the fort, and bring yer throwin' arm!"
4344,"Where are My Reinforcements? : This has simply gone too far. I cannot ignore our abandonment any longer.  After all that's happened here, and all you've been through in Firebough, we must travel to the monastery.  Whatever they are doing in there can wait! We can take my balloon up the mountain to the Monastery. It's anchored back by the camp, to the northeast."
4345,"Timeless Nutriment : As you have surmised, the flora and fauna of this island are quite unusual. Not all explanations are mysterious, however. Sometimes, we must listen to the land, to hear the tales of the world around us. Have you considered that the creatures of this island grew to such proportions simply from the nutriment of the land you walk upon?You will find nutriment in abundance throughout the island: ripe fruits, eggs, meat, flowers, nuts, and even the stones themselves. Eat, and discover the power of the land."
4346,"Behind the Battlefront : This battlefront has been undermanned and unsupplied for too long during my absence in Kun-Lai. We need to get things back in order here before we can pick up the trail of the Sha of Hatred.Taoshi is my best. I've sent her north to investigate rumors of mantid that have somehow made it through the battlefront. I need someone I can trust to get out there and work with her to plug any holes in our defenses.If my reports on you are correct, I can trust you with this, right <class>?"
4347,Barrels of Fun : I love blowing stuff up. It's in my blood!The yaungol to the west at Fire Camp Ordo have a ton of explosive barrels just lying around.I say we put them to good use and destroy their oil-pumpin' machines while having some fun!
4348,"Snack Time : Cloud serpents love to eat, and one of their favorite treats is the sugar minnow.These fish can be found in salt or fresh water anywhere in Pandaria. I trust you have some skill in fishing, and your own fishing pole to catch them?Bring me a fresh catch and I'm sure the hungry beasts around here will be very grateful."
4349,"He Won't Even Miss It : I've noticed Garrosh and that Reliquary blood elf carrying around some sort of journal.The journal is never more than a stone's throw away. It must be important!If you can cause enough of a distraction, you may be able to swipe the journal off the table.These yaks might just do the trick. Give one of 'em a tap and they'll do the rest.Just be ready to move fast!"
4350,"Timeless Treasures : The journal indicates that treasures abound across the island, sometimes temptingly out of reach, and other times hidden in dark caves and hollows. What might have been secreted away here, many generations ago?And perhaps more importantly, by whom?Search the island for such treasures, and return to me with your findings. Be warned that all that glitters is not gold, yet the reverse is also true. Sometimes the simple hollowed-out stump is the best hiding place for one's valuables."
4351,"The Klaxxi : The Klaxxi are only rumored to exist, far beyond the wall in the Dread Wastes.Few have ventured into that territory, and none have returned to tell the tale.If you are set on finding these... Klaxxi... there is a small group of Shado-Pan manning the wall to the far southwest who may know more."
4352,"Crime and Punishment : The Stinging Trail nurtures young Kypari trees. The empress drains the saplings too early, outsider. They must grow before the amber can be taken.The Klaxxi'va demand punishment for this crime! It will please them if you rain death on the Ik'thik harvesters."
4353,"The Road to Kun-Lai : Ah! Greetings friend of Lorewalker Cho. I have a message for you.<The strange little creature hands you a battered scroll case.>The Lorewalker waits for you in Kun-Lai. Very dangerous to travel there, yes, very dangerous.Look for guides along the road to help you find your way."
4354,"Ellia Ravenmane : We regularly organize one-on-one duels with trainees that we think are well-suited for one another. We have found one such trainee for you, <name>.Her name is Ellia Ravenmane. This will be her first duel, too. She will be waiting for you at the pavilion just to the south of here."
4355,"Empty Nests : When the attacks began, the young hatchlings scattered in terror.They are roaming around the island, lost and scared.If you want to help, take this rope and leash the lost little ones. Take them back to their nests. Return them home."
4356,"The Divine Bell : If the Alliance thought they could steal the Divine Bell from us, they were wrong!Even now, we have them trapped in the crypts beneath us.Death will be the price they pay for defying us.Come, <class>. Let us show them the error of their ways."
4357,"Simian Sabotage : The hozen steal from us, and we keep stealing our stuff back. It has to stop sometime.<Farmer Yoon hands you a barrel of fireworks.>Find some of our stolen supplies in their mountain camp to the west, and place these fireworks beside them. Hopefully, if they see the explosions, they'll think our supplies are defective and stop stealing altogether.It's worth a shot, right?"
4358,"Set the Mantid Back : Every day, the mantid build up munitions for use on their enemies. We cannot stop them, just you and I... but we can set them back.<Tai Ho hands you some explosives.>I need to keep a low profile. Would you do the honors?"
4359,"Meet the Cap'n : Alright, $p, I got another job for ya.You see that lion seal in the pen over there? Name's Dog. He's been Soggy's pet for years.Dog's acting up lately - I think he's getting restless in that pen. Why don't you go talk to Soggy and let him know.I'd say it's about time you meet the cap'n anyway."
4360,"Mazu's Breath : Here to help, are ya? Well, first thing's first.<Arie rummages through her pockets for a moment before producing a small vial of glowing blue fluid.>Here it is! ""Mazu's Breath."" Cap'n's own formula.What? You thought I'd send you out to sea without a means of breathin'? I need deckhands, not corpses!Down the hatch with it, green. This'll give you a fighting chance out there on the shelf."
4361,"Heinous Sacrifice : Some of the strongest of the spiritbinders perform heinous rites to their wretched gods.  We've devised a method to destroy their altars, so the difficult task will be getting to each altar alive.  Venture into the depths of Za'Tual and destroy their altars."
4362,"What's Eating Zhu's Watch? : Pandaren always welcome travelers with open arms - and open kegs! But this town full of jerks!Everyone so busy sulking, they won't talk to Ken-Ken at all!Can you find someone in town who will talk to us? Maybe normal pandaren just hiding in the houses?"
4363,"The Klaxxi Council : I must report to the Klaxxi. They would not have woken me unless the situation were dire.You have not been entirely useless. For that, I will spare your life.The council may even find a use for you."
4364,"Reeltime Strategy : I never thought I'd see the day, but for the first time since... well, EVER, Master Angler Ju Lien asked for some help with his lines.Apparently the sea is going crazy today and he can't keep up. See if you can give him a hand. He's fishing just south of here."
4365,"Unleash Hell : I will NOT let the Horde gain a foothold on these shores before we do! If you're looking to jump into the fray, I've got a spare gyrocopter for you at the end of the runway. An attack run is already programmed in, all you have to do is concentrate on shooting.Unleash hell upon these orcs!"
4366,"The Deadtalker Cipher : We need to understand what went wrong with the Deadtalkers.   For so many years, the Deadtalkers were simply responsible for maintaining the burial grounds and holding funerals for fallen warriors.  From a recent raid, we've recovered a tablet from the grounds that is clearly written using a cipher, but it isn't one we've encountered before. If you can gather a ciphered scroll from one of the Deadtalkers, we can begin to put together the cypher and understand what's happened."
4367,"De-Subjugation : The Kor'kron have been trained to be the finest, most loyal soldiers of the Warchief. Their presence here means that Garrosh fears an uprising.Vol'jin and his people are as much a part of the Horde as any orc.We must break this occupation and free the trolls. It pains me to say this, but you must eliminate enough of the Kor'kron so that the trolls can retake their city. Then meet me at Darkspear Hold so we might challenge their officer directly."
4368,"Sacred Recipe : ""When the horror comes a-risingAnd the heavens hum with warOur great vessel of salvationMust be broken from its core.""The scroll continues on for several stanzas. Perhaps somebody at The Sunset Brewgarden will be able to decipher its cryptic message."
4369,"Voice of the Gods : Too slowly!? We are working as quickly as possible for the Warchief!We must excavate carefully, catalogue each find, and of course follow safety procedures. He must understand!Well, we may have something to show him soon. Do you see that stone statue to the west?We suspect it is an ancient stone storage vessel. Now we just have to find a way to open it.If you would care to help us with our excavation, please go about it carefully."
4370,"A Cry From Darkness : So, you survived the imperial clutches. You are... resilient.The Klaxxi hear another paragon to the north, among the sha-scorched roots of Kypari Vor.This one cries out in terror and agony. It cannot be saved.The Klaxxi want him put down. Go and defeat him or do not return here."
4371,"His Name Was... Stormstout : An unusual pandaren came through town a few days back. He told a better tale than Pan, drank twice as much as Lee, and then beat me up in front of the bar. All while his little niece made fun of us.It was awesome.They said they were headed to the Valley of the Four Winds. You should meet him! Just... watch out for that right hook."
4372,"Bros Before Hozen : While you were gone, I saw a group of grummles coming down the Burlap Trail. It was led by my Brother Yakshoe.But then the Knucklethumps attacked. They took my brother and his grummles north.Please, $p! Save my brother. He always has bad fortune and no luck, but he is my brother. Look for him at the alter in front of Fort Silverback."
4373,"The Temple of the Jade Serpent : You've done us a huge favor here, traveler.Now that we have enough jade to complete the statue, we should send word of our progress to Yu'Lon, the Jade Serpent.When you arrive, speak to Elder Sage Wind-Yi outside the entrance to the Temple of the Jade Serpent.If you wish to speed your journey, speak to Kitemaster Shoku. I'm sure he can spare an extra kite for you."
4374,The Right Tool For The Job : I've scouted the area and found no leads on the prince or Admiral Taylor. We need to neutralize this base quickly and continue our search elsewhere.Operations here are being led by an orc warlock; Ga'trul. He's barricaded the dock and is trying to escape through a demonic circle.Put that flaregun to work again and blow those barricades! I'll cover your back and move in when you reach Ga'trul.
4375,"The Lesser of Two Evils : Like any farming community, we have the occasional virmen troubles.The most powerful Springtail virmen live high up in the cliffs to the north, and only come down when they run out of veggies to nibble on.Frankly, I've dealt with virmen before. They're nothing but a pest that must be kept in check, and there's no better way to do that than by killing their warren-mother. Easy as that."
4376,"Barreling Along : No, no, no, don't you worry about pickin' 'em up. I can hold these here barrels.I may not be the handsomest pandaren, or the smartest, or any fun to be around in the slightest, but I'm stronger than a mushan beast.I'mma just need you to lead the way."
4377,"Dark Skies : The swarm begins, Wakener! The mantid amass at the Heart of Fear.Already they fill the skies with their wings and rend the earth with their claws. They shall not stop the dark march until their bodies are laid open and bleeding upon the ground.This we shall gladly do. We will attack them from above. While I fly, use my poisons to destroy their advance.Do not mix the two serums until you are ready to attack. The reaction can be quite... violent.Speak to me when you are ready to go."
4378,"Eastwind Rest : I am injured, but we can't stop here.  The hozen were... unreliable. The pandaren would be much better allies.  You have seen the refugees in this village, and heard of the yaungol invasion, no?  Well, we've heard from the locals that Eastwind Rest, a nearby village, was destroyed by the Yaungol.  Apparently some survivors have gathered along the road out of town.  Go. Take the road west. Gather the survivors.   We'll help them rebuild. Then, they will see the advantage of joining the Horde!"
4379,"Beneath the Heart of Fear : The Klaxxi have detected the existence of another paragon, Wakener.This one was kept well-hidden from us, and for good reason.The Empress already has possession of this one, and her adjuncts work to destroy it even now.They are performing their sorcery in a chamber deep beneath the palace, and they must be stopped.We hold Klaxxi'vess. You must go in our stead. Find the entrance to their chamber from the ledge to the west."
4380,"The Savior of Stoneplow : That commander speaks hastily. He has the weapon he needs to win this battle. He has YOU.""But it's too hard,"" you might say.You would be wrong. It is not too hard. NOTHING IS TOO HARD.Go now, <name>. Go, and save Stoneplow!"
4381,"Pooped : <Your serpent catches your gaze and ducks its head bashfully.>You can tell that someone has gotten out of its pen and had ""an accident.""Well, at the rate that the hatchling's been eating, it had to come out the other end... somewhere.You had better find the serpent's poop and clean it up before the Serpent Masters find out."
4382,"Missed Me By... That Much! : Listen, <pal/toots>.I sent out a coupla supply drones from the gunship, and they've all been lost or crashed. Almost all, that is.One of 'em buzzed right through the camp here and crashed out by them waterfalls.How 'bout you see what you can do about bringin' the contents of that crate back here, hmm?We're all outta drones, but my rocket boots might get come in handy... or footy, as the case may be.Hah! I just kill me..."
4383,"Mogu at the Gates : The time has come. The other mogu clans have set their sights on the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.  They will not conquer it.  Some of your kind have already gone to the gate to scout out the size of their force. If you think yourself worthy for such a mission, meet them there."
4384,"Promises of Gold : As soon as the creature died, a strange group of sprites appeared and took its pearl away.The sprites have a village nearby, called Rikkitun Village. Perhaps you should investigate."
4385,"Pick a Yak : I can't find a single good yak here. ALL the yaks are bad!Some are too stinky, some too fight-y, others just scared.You look like a lucky <race>. Here, take a lasso. See if you can find a good yak for me."
4386,"Once More Into Kor'vess : You found this on a member of the swarm? It seeps with corruption... and with power. We could be faced with a serious threat if the rest of the mantid's amber is similarly corrupted.  Far to the west in the Dread Wastes lies Kor'vess, a large kypari tree that provides the swarm with most of its amber. From there, we can determine just how much of their stores have been infused with the energy of the Old Gods.  I will meet you closer to the tree."
4387,"Sha Can Awe : The sha have the mysterious ability to evoke powerful, often overwhelming, emotional responses in their victims.As we fled the temple, senior members of the Crane Wing order stayed behind to cover our escape. They are no doubt being subjected to intense emotional trauma, and I fear they are not all strong enough to resist falling into despair.$p, we have to show them there is still hope! Show them that despair CAN be defeated!"
4388,"The Best Around : We're going to need help if we hope to figure out Garrosh's plans for Pandaria.I have someone specific in mind, but he will not be easy to convince.Agent Connelly considers himself retired, but one does not simply leave the SI: 7. We've had an undercover agent following his every move for months.Currently, he is disguising himself as a high roller at Bizmo's Brawlpub. Something about settling an old debt.Meet with our undercover agent in the Brawler's Guild."
4389,Touching Ground : Their town is burning and their men are scattered and broken. I need every available man on the ground NOW to finish them off.Grab one of the parachutes on the edge of the ship and get down there!
4390,"Assault Fire Camp Gai-Cho : The Yaungol are a constant nuisance, but the group at Fire Camp Gai-Cho, to the northeast, conspired with the Osul yaungol in their recent incursion into Kun-Lai.  We cannot allow such an incursion to go unpunished.  Go, attack Fire Camp Gai-Cho. We need to make sure they remain occupied, so that they cannot rise up and threaten The Ox Gate again."
4391,"The Emperor : We have everything we need. It's time to start brewing.Pay attention, <name>... you might learn a thing or two."
4392,"Traffic Issues : Yaungols are attacking our Burlap Trail. This is most bad fortune for grummles.We use that trail to carry supplies to the Serpent's Spine. Without supplies, the defenders of the wall are in danger.Grummles are packers and explorers, not fighters. Could you be a luckydo for us and stop the yaungol blockade?"
4393,"Lay of the Land : Curse these furry pests! Kill one, and two more rise in its place...Nothing has changed, <name>. Orders are orders, no matter how few of us stand and regardless of the odds.I have plans to make and problems to solve.I want you to get out there and learn the lay of the land. Don't return until you have something useful to report.And silence that yammering fool while you're out there!Dismissed!"
4394,"Kypa'rak's Core : <As the ringworm tumbles apart, a massive chunk of organic kyparite falls from its core. Someone at Klaxxi'vess will want to see this.>"
4395,The Dissector Wakens : You are... not like the others...I hear the Klaxxi calling... <cough>I just need a moment.
4396,"Treasures of the Thunder King : My scouts have returned with word that more of the treasures from Lei Shen's tomb are being brought up into the citadel. We have access to a secret sewer entrance, but a door bars us from intercepting the shipment. If we're going to succeed in this raid, we will need a key that only the most trusted of Lei Shen's forces carry.If you get your hands on such a key, bring it to me.You can keep whatever spoils you steal from our raid. I simply want to see that this shipment never makes it to Lei Shen."
4397,"Sacred Waters : I appreciate you coming all this way to save me, but Ren is gravely injured.The old pandaren had no reason to help me, yet still he risked his life to save my own.Before the fever set in, he mentioned that there are healing waters in the cave just down the hill.It is dangerous, but I will do anything to help my friend. Will you help me retrieve the waters?"
4398,Roll Club: Serpent's Spine : Get to the bottom of the wall in the fastest time possible.Speak to me when you're ready to roll.
4399,Someone You Should See : $p? It is good fortune I find you.Chen Stormstout says to give this to you and ask you to meet him at Binan Village of the Kun-Lai Summit.He found a friend of yours who needs much luck to get healthy.Chen say speak to Tak-Tak for fast travels.
4400,"Find Thrall! : <Vol'jin half opens an eye and begins to move his lips as if to speak.  Though no sound comes, you decipher two words.>Find Thrall.<With an effort, Vol'jin thrusts a hearthstone into your hands and then passes out.>"
4401,"Seeking Zin'jun : Rivett claims to have seen Zin'jun abandon ship with the rest of the survivors. That means he's still out there somewhere.We can't leave him behind. He could be injured or worse yet, captured!Go track down Zin'jun and bring him back."
4402,"Grave Consequences : We've found ancient mogu burial urns among the ruins on Shan'ze Dao.This is normally no problem, except these urns are home to angry mogu spirits.Not only do these urns pose a danger to anyone unlucky enough to find one, but they could be used for destruction if they were to fall into the wrong hands.We must rid Shan'ze Dao of their presence."
4403,"Nope : We're holding, but just barely. Anything you can do to stem the tide of dreadspinners coming up the wall would be a big help.Feel like tearing open spider eggs one at a time by hand?I didn't think so. Take one of our dragon guns and light it up down there. I wanna hear those puppies pop."
4404,
4405,"Walking Dog : Dog ain't my ""pet."" He's a member of this crew, and my best friend. Saved my life more than once, you know.But I'm gettin' too old to walk him anymore, and he still needs his exercise. Take Dog for a trip around the shelf for me, would ya?He loves to swim through the hot geysers just southeast of the shallows.He absolutely has to... er... ""leave his mark"" on the dead whale at the far western edge of the shelf.Oh, and he'll want to visit our old shipwreck, too. He likes to reminisce."
4406,"Paint it Red! : They shot out our engines and we floated here - HERE! Right in the firing line of the enemy!You know what to do, <name>. Get below decks and man those guns!Show these scum that they're in OUR line of fire!"
4407,"The Sprites' Plight : <Living statues rampage through the woods.For now, they seem content in pummeling the forest sprites into splinters, but if they continue any further the pandaren will have more than just missing jade to worry about.>"
4408,"Better Dead than Dread : I am sure many of our associates will be requesting your services after your victory here. But I have received a request for aid from our defenders at the wall along the Dread Wastes.  If you would assist them, then take a kite and check in with Bowmistress Li."
4409,"Emergency Care : I... am alive... but barely. They killed the rest. My friends... and family...  I must return to the village... But, I do not have long, and cannot move on my own... are you a healer? I... have a healing potion in my hut... search my belongings. You can use your magic, if you have it."
4410,"Ahead on the Way : Huge maws of despair are spewing out sha from the pagodas on either side of the temple. Meanwhile, your impromptu training in the Way continues.""She who mends torn umbrella will be more dry than she who strikes at rain.""While I take issue with that particular lesson--sometimes punching the rain can be quite effective--the meaning holds true in this case.Take out those maws of despair and give my order a chance at reclaiming the temple grounds."
4411,"Welcome to Dawn's Blossom : Cho's off on another one of his adventures, and this one requires a big order of jade. I'm going to have to call in some favors.How 'bout in the meantime you introduce yourself to some of the locals.Kai Wanderbrew is a good guy to know, as is Master Windfur. Oh, and say hi to Peiji Goldendraft up at the inn.Between the three of them, you should get the feel for life in Dawn's Blossom."
4412,"SI:7 Report: Fire From the Sky : Yeah, we found Amber, she's alive, and all that. That's about where the good news stops though.Let's see if I can pick up where ol' Rell left off..."
4413,"Chasing the Chicken : Say, you there! <name>, was it? I've got a problem, and I need someone with better legs than mine to help me solve it.My prize-winning chicken has flown the coop! Now she's out in the open, mingling with the other hens, wild birds, and... <gulp> ill-intentioned roosters.My farm is west of here, south of the Skyrange. Could you find her, and bring her back to me?"
4414,"The Kunzen Hunter-Chief : From what I've gathered, the Kunzen hozen have two chiefs. One is harmless - he deals with potions, medicines, and ancient fables. The other one is in charge of the Kunzen's hunters - and the only thing they've been hunting lately is our crops.The Hunter-Chief is a problem waiting to be solved. I'm sure the local farmers would be grateful if you went up there and, you know, ""took care"" of him."
4415,"Unsafe Passage : As we say at the temple: ""Never fight a tiger with a hozen on your back.""We will deal with the sha, but first we must see to the more immediate... nuisance.<Koro slams the writhing saurok HARD against the stone.>Groups of refugees from the temple are heading for a camp to the north, but they're being ambushed by saurok. Help me see the next group to the camp and we'll figure out our next move from there."
4416,"A Bold Idea : Zandalari warships plunder the seas around this island. They ferry in soldiers and war beasts from Zandalar to bolster Lei Shen's army.If we can capture the palace shipyard, the Thunder King's supply line will be cut off, and your foothold here will be secure.I have a plan to do just that, and it won't take an entire army."
4417,"It's A... : Oh my! This egg is going to hatch at any second!Well, looks like this little guy is eager to meet you.Are you ready?"
4418,"A Poor Grasp of the Basics : Virmen - they no just eat our food. They trying to start farms of their own. The problem is... well, they ookin' dumb.You no believe Muno? Last night, they break into tool sheds... steal equipment. When we wake up, we find rakes and wheelbarrows planted in ground.They was WATERING them. They was trying to GROW WHEELBARROWS.Please, while you out there, unbury our stuff."
4419,"Weed War II : Ssshhay... d'you know that guy over on the farm, with the... the *hic*... the weed problem? Gai Lan, I think his name was. I love that guy, man.Anywayshh, he said that if I *hic* sent an adventurer over to go pick his weeds, he'd get me some ale.It's jusht a few weeds, not too many, probably.*hic*"
4420,"Quill of Stingers : To achieve perfect paint strokes, one must have the right tools. My own have fallen into disrepair, their bristles becoming as unmanageable as hozu hair.Have you seen the wasps throughout the Arboretum? Their stingers can be fashioned into quills that provide just the right level of sharpness in each line.Could you gather some for me please?"
4421,"Bound With Shade : About that scroll you found...I keep looking at that line in the second stanza - ""bound with wood and shade"". The ""shade"", in particular, intrigues me.I must admit, I've often considered taking some of the area's residual sha essence and incorporating it into a brew. I suspect that this is the shade which our recipe calls for.You will find large amalgamations of sha to the southeast of our tree... though you may also be able to harvest some from the local wildlife."
4422,"Acid Rain : Since you've been gone, more and more of these creatures are approaching our camp. They appear to be amassing for a major assault!We're going to have to take some drastic measures if we hope to see tomorrow.Here, take my poisoned throwing stars and figure out a way to thin out their numbers."
4423,"Sweet as Honey : <The hatchling scampers about, then whines and whimpers.>From the cloud serpent's behavior, you have a hunch that it wants a sweet treat.The fragrant trees in The Arboretum are home to many honey hives.It will be a simple matter to collect combs from the nearby honeykeepers."
4424,"Evacuation Orders : A few farmers remain in the fields... some perilously close to the crumbling wall. I don't want any farmers pretending to be heroes. We will take care of this mantid swarm, and then they can return to their homes.My Shado-Pan are too busy defending this town to organize evacuations. You want to prove yourself useful? Get those farmers out of harm's way."
4425,"Raiding the Vault : The Swollen Vault is a repository for some of Lei Shen's nastiest weaponry and most prized trinkets - not surprisingly, these are often one and the same.One artifact in particular, an amulet known as the Choker of Storms, could help us to understand his apparent mastery over lightning.Break into the vault and slay the hoard-keeper. Take his key and use it to recover the amulet from a cache at the back of the vault."
4426,"The Warchief and the Darkness : I see now how the Alliance king leads his people. But what is the Horde warchief up to? Just below us, a swarm of goblins are burrowing into the sacred vale on his orders. What does he hope to find there? We must find out!"
4427,"The High Elder : How strange, to have such a foreign-looking <class> visiting our temple. Are you here to study?You... you look very strong. You wouldn't have any trouble getting accepted into the monastery. You should talk to the High Elder, up on the balcony above."
4428,"Ken-Ken : So... Ken-Ken. The hozen.Personally, I'm impressed he's progressed so far in his training. He's got a brain between his ears, which is more than can be said for most of his kind.He said he was headed east, but, seeing as we're already on the far east side of the valley, I can't imagine he went too far from here. Look for him at Zhu's Watch, in Krasarang Wilds, down the path to the south. See what he's found."
4429,"Flight Training: In Due Course : Now that you have learned the basics of the race, you should go learn the course.Explore the spires and collect a race flag from each of the checkpoints.Fly through each checkered flag to collect it."
4430,"Empowering the Hourglass : The hourglass gives us glimpses into the streams of time we once walked as easily as a well-worn path.Gather additional epoch stones, so that we may continue to use the power of the hourglass to delve into the mysteries of the timeways.The future depends on it."
4431,Along the Southern Front : I'm heading westward with Taoshi to gather the strongest I can find to confront the Sha of Hatred.I would like you to come with me.
4432,"The Order of the Cloud Serpent : The Order of the Cloud Serpent is always searching for talented riders.If you wish to follow our way, you should speak to Instructor Skythorn at The Arboretum in the Jade Forest.I wish you luck, <race>."
4433,"Nazgrim's Command : You have a comfortable base of operations, no Alliance around for miles, and a few Horde veterans by your side. It looks like it's time to start painting this continent red.General Nazgrim should know where to start."
4434,"The Ballad of Liu Lang : Dear $p,At long last thanks to your research we have the full Ballad of Liu Lang.If you visit us at the Seat of Knowledge in Vale of Eternal Blossoms we can add this contribution to your personal collection.Thank you for your diligence!Sincerely,Lorewalker Cho"
4435,"You Otter Know : You know what happened to the bait in those pots?Otters. That's what happened.They prefer fresh clams, but they'll pick our crab traps clean if they're hungry enough.The otters in Lonesome Cove are protected by law and we run a legitimate operation here. As much as I'd love to chum those little rats and call it a day, we just make sure they aren't hungry enough to raid the crab pots.Toss 'em a few clams to keep them busy while you're out there."
4436,"Challenge Accepted : The yaungol have always been a difficult, proud people, but never this violent or aggressive.   I do not know what has prompted this change in their behavior, but we don't have time to find out, now. We fear for our lives and livelihoods as long as Ur-Bataar, leader of the Bataari yaungol, lives.  Go, set the banner in his camp ablaze to challenge him, and then defeat him in battle. Only then will we be secure."
4437,"To Bridge Earth and Sky : We are ready to open the tan-chao and guide all of these spirits back to peace.If I may, I would have your assistance once more. The mogu will surely sense the ritual taking place and will do everything in their power to halt it. I need only a few moments without interference, and once the path is open it will surge too greatly to be closed.If you are willing to help one more time, please accompany me to the ritual site."
4438,"The Shrouded Coin : A swirling mist envelops the coin and it begins to float above your hand. The mist briefly parts to reveal a shiny new coin, yet in the next instant the coin appears worn from years of exchange. As the coin settles back in to your hand, visions of jungles and mist shrouded peaks waft into your mind, and through the vision you recognize the four Celestials gathered in the courtyard of an island."
4439,"Attention : Your next test also involves concentration and attention. I want you to practice your abilities on the training bags in the pit below.The bags are hung in groups of two. When I call out ""Left"", attack the bag on the left. When I call out ""Right"", attack the bag on the right.If you fail to follow my simple directions, this task will become much harder.Now beat on those practice bags until they burst, <name>."
4440,"SI:7 Report: Take No Prisoners : The final leg of our journey took us west, to a large hozen village. We set up a small camp in the mountains, outside of their line of sight..."
4441,"Perfection : Perfection can be achieved through repetition. Every single student in the training arena below will eventually perfect his or her form... assuming they don't give up first. This is a fact.I encourage you to join them, <name>. As an honorary guest of the monastery, you are not required to perform the requisite 10,000 daily strikes. Simply follow the leader's example for a few minutes."
4442,"The Tongue of Ba-Shon : Thank you for coming, $p. I am sorry to have been so cryptic, but I could not risk alerting the mogu to my work here.They are seeking something in the valley. Plundering the tombs of their old kings for relics of power.I could not observe them long before having to flee, but I did manage to recover a relic of my own.The Tongue of Ba-Shon will let us communicate securely over long distances, but only after I have bound it to myself.I think I'm ready to begin, if you are."
4443,"Low Turnip Turnout : Your help here is appreciated, <name>. I'd like to give you another job, if you're interested.My son, Ang, runs the small farm just down this hill. He should have brought me some fruits and vegetables this morning, but I haven't seen him all day.Would you go down there and see what's going on?"
4444,"Regroup! : They have an airbase! I have underestimated this Alliance Captain for the last time. So many good warriors lost...There must have been a few survivors who were able to bail during the crash. We need every able-bodied fighter we can get.Find as many survivors as you can in the forest below, and I will investigate the wreckage itself. Rally everyone together at the nearby village for a counter-attack."
4445,"Family Tree : So there you have it, traveler, or as much of it as would make for a proper introduction, hmm?What of you, then? Are your people so much different than mine?Surely, there must be things we share in common. Let us see..."
4446,"Fresh Pots : We got a load of empty crab pots out there that need fresh bait.Now, we COULD pull them one at a time and bait them up here in comfort. A nice chair to sit on, maybe a hot cup of tea to keep you warm. Sounds nice, doesn't it?Never gonna happen.Head to Lonesome Cove, immediately southwest, and bait those pots with two chunks of fresh sea monarch. By ""fresh"" I mean killed right there in the water.Oh, and by ""pots"" I mean traps. If you wanna be part of the crew, you'd better learn the lingo."
4447,"Hero Killer : There are some situations in which taking out one of their soldiers is more important than killing hundreds.  They've deployed some of their heroes to the battlefield to help rally their defenders. Not only will killing them soften their defense, it will also leave their morale crippled.  So go, take one down for me. You can handle it."
4448,"Better With Age : It is a crime to harvest the young trees, but a much bigger crime to waste the amber.Young amber is not as strong, but the Klaxxi need it to continue the fight. We will bring them more and they will sing my praises!Gather the young amber. We will store it until it is aged and can be consumed."
4449,"Finding Your Center : The dream brew is complete! This time, when you drink it, you must embrace the visions you see from a state of inner focus.Follow me to my pagoda, and I will teach you how to achieve the inner calm that we pandaren value so much.Your troubled mind will present you with many distractions, but just remember to stay centered!"
4450,"Refining The Vision : I have finished grinding the stones, and have attuned the hourglass to a new series of timeways. Will you return to the Siege of Orgrimmar and turn the hourglass once more?Return quickly, I am most curious."
4451,"One Final Turn : I do not wish to ask this of you again, but I do not know who I can trust any longer. I have been using the Vision of Time to gather information, and in my searches, I believe I have found another crux in time. It is in the Caverns of Time itself.I did not want to believe it when the vision first came to me, but I cannot sit idly by and let this information pass. The Caverns of Time - you must go there, now, and use the Vision of Time.Move quickly!"
4452,"It Was Almost Alive : A ritual took place here, and from the looks of it wasn't successful.Among the abandoned items a book lies open. The text on the pages is foreign to you.Carrying the whole book may be difficult, but a single page might be enough. If you can get the page to Lorewalker Cho he may be able to tell you what it says."
4453,"Trapping the Leader : It is time to make our move. Go to the Tomb of Shadows, weaken him, and take him captive.  I will stay here in case Garrosh arrives. He must be delayed so that we can take our prize before he destroys it in his anger.  Hurry!"
4454,The Matriarch's Maw : <The enormous mandibles of the kunchong matriarch Karanosh should be of value to someone in Klaxxi'vess.>
4455,"Cryin' My Eyes Out : I coulda taken out da whole lot of 'em, mon.Shot 'em one by one, den played dead when dey be gettin' close. Fell for it every time, dey did - well almost every time...One of 'em finally got wise. Called my bluff. Before I knew it, dey was usin' my eyes as marbles.Ran off with my goods an' left me here ta die, da savages...Help me, mon. Lemme die wit my dignity intact."
4456,"Round 1: Brewmaster Chani : Welcome, Challenger, to my tournament of champions! Today we test the strengths of Pandaria's most dedicated heroes.Your first opponent awaits you under the eastern gazebo. Defeat her, and you may proceed to the next round.Fight with strength, fight with honor."
4457,"In Her Clutch : The crystal sings to the Klaxxi. They sense a paragon in the clutch, east of the tower.Clutch-keepers are trying to pollute this one. The Klaxxi will not permit this.Go and find the paragon. Place your hands on his chamber, and the Klaxxi will channel their whispers through you to break him free. Protect him if you can."
4458,"A Visit with Lorewalker Cho : Stranger, I may be able to help you find your prince. But first, I would like to know a little more about you and your people.Come, help me with my chores, and we will chat.You have the look of a grizzled war veteran, but certainly you have a few minutes to help a bookish Pandaren like myself putter around the house, yes?"
4459,"Prowler Problems : The animals have all gone crazy!Normally the prowlers steer clear of the village, but now we can't seem to keep them away. I've never seen them act this way before!The mayor has summoned in the Shado-Pan, but they're not all here yet. Can you take care of those prowlers before they maul one of our farmers?"
4460,"Mists of Pandaria: To Pandaria! : Please come to Stormwind Keep immediately for a briefing with King Varian Wrynn.We have received word of a conflict in the seas to the south, and we need the help of an experienced <class> to assist in the investigation."
4461,"Instant Courage : It is very bad fortune to travel mountain paths without a good guide. We grummles make the best guides, but many have run away. They fear the mountain pass now. Many good grummles disappear up there.Grummles are good at many things, but are not very brave. Maybe with fire lotus incense you can make them brave. Then they will show you the way."
4462,"Sudden, Unexpected Crocolisk Aggression : Normally, my day consists of catching fish, and then eating the fish I caught, followed by sleeping. Note that I did not include ""fight with a crocolisk"" in that list of activities.You look like a handy <class>. Can you go get rid of some of these crocolisks, so I can get back to my regular routine? The crocolisks normally keep to themselves up at Kea Krak, to the northwest."
4463,"A King Among Men : There's no time to waste, we need to find Troteman and secure the beach.We should check on the dwarves, too - the Explorer's League is tough, but they're no army. They should be along the cliff just north of here.Let us ride, <class>. For our friends. For the Alliance."
4464,"What's Mined Is Yours : Aw'right, so you need jade, do ya? I'd say we owe you at least that - we got plenty in the quarry, and thanks to yer help we should be back on schedule in no time.I should probably get back to the wife, so let's you and me take this cart o' the good stuff straight to her.Now, I ain't never met no <race> t'were too big for me to pull in a wagon. You climb on the back there and let ol' Hao do the legwork."
4465,"Anduin's Plea : Ah, just the <class> I was looking for. I have received an urgent letter from the young Prince Anduin.He is playing host to his father, King Wrynn, and several other Alliance dignitaries at the Shrine of Seven Stars in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.According to his most recent correspondence, something bad is happening at the city.Please go at once and speak with him. I must settle some affairs here at Lion's Landing, but I will join you soon.Speak to Fennie if you'd like a ride to the Vale."
4466,
4467,"Onward and Inward : ""Sha"" energy, hm? Tread carefully, <name> - there's a hidden darkness to this continent.We'll stay behind to mop up the rest of the Horde, but we need you to continue with the main mission: the rescue of Captain Taylor, and the retrieval of Prince Anduin.Our aerial scouts think we've found the wreckage of the flagship near Paw'don Village. Go there and report to Admiral Rogers for instructions.You are welcome to use my gyrocopter."
4468,"Give Them Peace : I overheard. Our secret is out, then.When I learned that the mantid had burrowed beneath our temple, I reacted hastily. I sent dozens of guardians to defend what they could, but they were not prepared. They succumbed to fear, and never returned.A pandaren deserves to die embracing the ground, as he does in sleep... not flat on his back with his eyes transfixed in terror. Please, <name>. Give them the peace they deserve."
4469,"Clear the Way : Are you seeing this? Virmen, hozen, and water sprites... all pouring out of the brewery doors and windows! What the heck is going on in there!?There is another entrance, on the eastern side of the brewery. I'm going to run over there and try to figure out what's going on. In the meantime, see if you can't get rid of these creatures. There's nothing worse than a drunken hozen."
4470,"My Son... : My son - can you find my son?  When the Jinyu attacked, he ran off in the confusion. I don't know if they've done anything with him, or if he's still alive, even.  Nothing else matters if I can't find him.   I'd ask Mei... but something's wrong with her. She seems too... impulsive since the attack. I just can't trust that she'd bring him back safely."
4471,"Carp Diem : Despite the hozen's apparent disarray, there is an order to their chaos. Their leader, Chief Gukgut, is the shrewd mastermind behind their attacks.He is organizing their movements at the great pit at the hozen camp to the northwest.Strike now and show him no mercy, <name>, for he will do the same."
4472,"To Mogujia : The Explorer's League sent an expedition north some days ago.We haven't heard from them since, and I'd sleep better at night knowing our folks aren't in some sort of trouble.Last I heard, Brann Bronzebeard was heading toward Mogujia in the Kun-Lai Summit.Find him and report back with their status. Fennie over there can give you a ride if you need one."
4473,"Thumping Knucklethump : The Knucklethump hozen have new chief, the Ook of Dook.He sees fear in the west, anger in the south, hatred in the north, and yaungols in the east.And so he sets his hozen to ravage, gathering food and supplies for coming famine.They are many Knucklethumps and dangerous.Please, Luckydo, can you defeat their fighters?"
4474,"Fisherman's Tale : The villagers of Zouchin know the coast better than anyone in Kun-Lai. If the Zandalari are hiding on one of the islands, they will know.Mishi will take you as far as Emperor's Path. I will go ahead to speak with the village elders.Follow the path to Whispercloud Rise. Shin Whispercloud will help you reach the village."
4475,"Living Amber : Liquid amber is most efficient for restoring a newly awakened paragon's strength, and is usually provided at a wakening ceremony.Unfortunately, it seems you did not receive these instructions, so we shall have to improvise.I can sense a vast quantity of fossilized amber in the lake below us. It will serve, but I am too weak to dig it up myself.Do this for me, and I will see to it that you are rewarded."
4476,"By the Sea, Nevermore : The Klaxxi'va have spoken to me, outsider. The paragon is hidden in the Briny Muck only, he is not so hidden anymore.The lizard men surround him. He cannot fall into their scaley hands.You will find him; you will awaken him. Do not return without him!If you do this the Klaxxi will be pleased with us."
4477,"Work Order: The August Celestials I : <Yoon's familiar writing scrolls across the tattered paper.>The trainees out at the Cradle of Chi-Ji are in need of striped melons. Apparently, they use them in their training exercises.A representative will be by tomorrow to collect whatever striped melons you can spare."
4478,"The Wisdom of Niuzao : Niuzao, the Black Ox, rests in the temple to the west. He may know why the mantid are attacking.He may, in fact, know much more than that.I will rendezvous with you at Niuzao Temple, <class>."
4479,"Gauging Our Progress : The time for war is at hand, <name>!We've been training these natives non-stop since you left, and I believe they're as good as they're going to get.See for yourself. Check in with the others and return with your findings.We must rely on our enemy being somehow... even less prepared."
4480,"Tomes of Ancient Madness : In times like these, it becomes necessary for all of the denizens of the Vale to pitch in and do their part. Unfortunately, I have never been much of a fighter, so my usefulness in times of war is limited.  However, I may be able to do some good. You see, we know very little about the invaders we face, and knowledge can be a very powerful weapon.  I think I have seen tomes carried by some of the k'thir. If you could bring some to me, I may be able to glean something useful from their writings."
4481,Comin' Round the Mountain : The mountain pass is very dangerous. You need much luck to survive. Nephew Bentnail will show you the way.Perhaps today is a lucky day to travel though. Wind blows from the east; this is good sign. Grummles always travel best when east wind blows.Climb in the cart when you are ready to leave.
4482,"Money Matters : I love working in the market, although there's one aspect of this job I really dislike: collecting debts.While most pandaren debts are simply due to laziness, there are a few unsavory characters around town who simply don't want to pay, and there's some who are just too poor.A few people here in town owe me money. Could you go talk to them, and remind them about what they owe?"
4483,"Students No More : Those five students - the ones who were looking for the Hidden Master - they went up to the front lines, alone. I'd send Shado-Pan to aid them, but I haven't got any left.There's dangerous creatures up there near the wall. If you find those students, make sure that they haven't fallen to any of them."
4484,"Love's Labor : Can I trouble you for another favor?We're way behind schedule, and this jade shipment is the last we need to finish the great statue.I've got my hands full, so could you run this ore over to the other foremen?Historian Dinh, Surveyor Sawa, and Kitemaster Shoku can all be found around the base of the statue. Taskmaster Emi is directing production at the top of the statue.We're on a deadline, so make sure you do it fast! Time's a wasting!"
4485,"Broken Dreams : Yes, I found the Stormstout Brewery... although I didn't exactly get the warm reception I expected.<Chen pours himself a mug of ale.>Do you want to hear the story?"
4486,"Flying Colors : The Rumpus was your final test. You have mastered the disciplines taught at this monastery.Just as your training began with a banquet, so shall it end. High Elder Cloudfall should be waiting at the banquet grounds. I'll be right behind you."
4487,"A Gift For Haohan : Haohan Mudclaw is the big boss of the Tillers union and the richest guy in the Valley! He's been nice to let me stay here, so I want to do something nice for him.He likes expensive stuff, like ruby shards, but I don't have a lot of money, so I need to get him something else.I know! I've seen a great big fish in Cattail Lake! We should get one of its teeth as a gift!"
4488,"Attack At The Temple of the Jade Serpent : Darkness enshrouds the Temple of the Jade Serpent, and Yu'Lon's priests beseech us for aid.They hold the sha in check, but just barely.You may be able to turn the tide, <class>."
4489,"Hidden Threads : You have kept our mission a secret, and for that I thank you. Knowledge of the timeways, when in the wrong hands, can cause catastrophic devastation. My flight has little power to repair it, now. We must be careful.The hourglass grows in power. I believe it can now be used to see much further than before. I wish you to push it to its limits.Return to the Siege of Orgrimmar, and focus the hourglass on the most devastating timeway you can find."
4490,"Seeker's Folly : I'm sure your pandaren friend has some ideas about what the mogu are after.He headed up the mountain a few days ago without a guide, and asked that only you be sent up after him. He was very specific:""The <class> must endure the trek alone, with only <his/her> thoughts. <He/She> will honor each shrine before meeting me at the top.""The path is just northwest of the camp, marked by flags. Please be careful! Seeker's Folly is a dangerous trek even on a lucky day."
4491,"Krasus' Landing : We can rescue as many Sunreavers as we want, but if they can't escape, then there's no point.The Silver Covenant will certainly be subduing and killing the Sunreavers' dragonhawks. Put a stop to it."
4492,"Get Back Here! : Oh, before I forget, I have something I was asked to deliver to you. A letter from one of your companions, I assume.I was made to understand that your presence was urgently required, so I took the liberty of arranging your passage.Speak to Ginsa Arroweye just south of here when you're ready. She has a kite waiting."
4493,"Ella's Taste Test : Well, I finally got the brew made, but I won't know if it's any good unless some people taste it.Would you take my brew and see what the folks in Halfhill think?I... I couldn't face them myself."
4494,"Old Age and Treachery : Look, I ain't got reason to trust you, but there's a task I can't give to my crew.I need you to search the wreck of our old ship, the Mist-Hopper, and bring back the charter. It'd be sealed up in a silver tube, in a footlocker.It's sort of, uh... incriminating. I can't risk any of the crew finding it if they decide to visit the ol' girl. She's resting on the Shelf of Mazu, to the west.I'd suggest riding a rip current out there, if you got the stomach. They're all over the shelf."
4495,"The Threat in the South : With the Sha of Hatred dead, the greatest threat to this land is vanquished, but our travels along the southern border have made it exceedingly clear that the mantid forces in the Dread Wastes are on the move, and likely won't be held back for long.If you wish to continue to aid the Shado-Pan, I would recommend reporting in to Bowmistress Li on the Serpent's Spine. She oversees the great wall that separates the terrors in the Dread Wastes from our bountiful lands to the east."
4496,"Training and Discipline : I told myself that, if I ever made it here to the Hidden Master, I would learn everything I could from him. This is my chance, <name>. I'm not going to let it slip away.Still, I fear that Stoneplow needs us. I left early, before we were able to push the mantid scouts back. I'd feel better if you would check in with the Watch Commander for me.Oh, and if you run into the others, maybe you should tell them where the Hidden Master is..."
4497,"I Bring Us Great Shame : I have failed my fellow brewers.I took some supplies out to the clearing, east of our tree... and I left them there. Now, with the sha corrupting the land, and the mantid on the prowl, it is too dangerous for me to bring them back.If you would help me look for them, perhaps I could regain some of my lost honor."
4498,"What Had To Be Done : Thank you for your aid today, <name>. I will be handling the purge from here on out.Jaina will soon be off to Lion's Landing, to speak with King Varian. She asked for your attendance."
4499,"Time In Your Hands : Inhabitants of this strange island barter with a special currency, immune from the fickle fluctuations of time.You would do well to gather as many of these ""timeless coins"" as possible! They can be found hidden away in small caches, or gathered from creatures all around the island. Larger, rarer creatures are a better source of coins - you may find it profitable to venture forth as part of a group.Introduce yourself to Mistweavers Ai and Ku across the Celestial Court, and gather some coins for me."
4500,"Culling the Swarm : The Empress continues to amass her forces. Without intervention, they WILL overrun that wall - even if it means smothering it in the corpses of a million swarmborn.Let us find a better place for those corpses.Let me know when you are ready to depart for the clutches - I will gladly drop you in from above."
4501,"The Essence of Time : It is about time that I revealed to you my purpose on this island.The bronze dragonflight's powers have diminished greatly - we can now only catch furtive glimpses through time. It is... quite frustrating.But we are not entirely without means. I hold in my hand the Vision of Time, an artifact of my own creation. The creatures of this isle have passed through time, and may carry with them some of its essence. With it, we will fill the hourglass, granting us a window into the timeways once more."
4502,"Mantid Under Fire : The mantid are attacking again, and we're a bit short-handed up on the wall. In hopes that you'd help, I saved one of the more fun posts for you: the hot oil!It's a bit more violent and a bit less scandalous than it sounds.It's simple really. Get up on the wall, find one of the oil stations, and dump it on any of the mantid pouring up against the wall. It's very effective."
4503,"Mothallus! : The esteemed Journeyman Chu would appear to have created a monster. It is silken death with wings.Mothallus.You have already faced its brood. Now we ask that you help us face the creature itself.Please, <class>, venture into the pit and rifle the bait. This will bring the beast to you.Our mothfighters will assist you as you need, though silk tends to stick to them more than most so you may need to help them, should they become overwhelmed."
4504,"The Waterspeaker's Staff : There is great dissent in Inkgill, <race>. Elder Shai Hu drank the sha-corrupted waters of the mere, and forced the others to do the same. When I protested, Orachi of the town guard confiscated my ritual staff and banished me.Now, I am not only an exile, I am unable to speak with the waters that once gave me guidance!I am not a fighter. But if you are, perhaps you can recover my staff from Orachi? He is in town to our north."
4505,"Life : My child is coming. I must help as I may.Stay nearby, hero. If my wife and child survive, I would have them look on the face of the one who saved them."
4506,For Family : Kor should have caught up by now. He said he was going to secure the Ruins of Korja east of here and meet us to help with the mantid threat.He may need help against Groundbreaker Brojai. Could you assist him? Kang and I will follow shortly.
4507,"Behind the Masks : The sha may seem unstoppable, but this is not true.Their masks seem to be the source of their power. When a sha and its mask are separated, the creature's essence is banished back to its own realm.Bring me intact masks, for I wish to study them further. Do be careful. I'm sure the sha will not part with them easily."
4508,Terror of the Dread Wastes : That thing is huge!The Shado-Pan holding the battlefront were never trained for something like this... let's get down there and take it out ourselves.
4509,Fire Is Always the Answer : It's not enough that we destroy their forces. Nothing must be left for them to salvage!Take this flare-gun and fire it into their munitions stockpiles. Leave them nothing!
4510,"Fumigation : Our alchemists have cooked up a set of gas bombs that will discourage mantid from staying anywhere that we set them off.   If we plant these in the critical structures of Sra'vess, they'll need to evacuate. That should sow some chaos and delay any action from the mantid there for days.  Get to it, <name>."
4511,"The Great Water Hunt : Look at it, <name>: the Gilded Fan. I heared lots of good things about the water they got here. Lots of bad things, too.No sayin' what kind of water Chen's gonna be needin', so what say we make him a little sampler platter?Come on, let's get movin'. We'll go scoop up some water together."
4512,"Why So Serious? : Okay, so that not work. Well... it cheer Ken-Ken up! But pandaren still sad...We try another old hozen remedy - this time, we go back even further than gramma, way WAY back to ancient times. Hozen still do this sometimes... mostly at parties.Ken-Ken got woodworking to do - you bring him teeth! Not yours; big ones, like a panther would have!Oh, and some paint! Mei might know where to find."
4513,"Hope Springs Eternal : The Shado-Pan are likely dealing with similar outbreaks elsewhere in Pandaria.Seek out Loon Mai, the Shado-Pan Watch Commander in Stoneplow on the western end of the Valley of the Four Winds. Let him know that we have the situation here under control; the Shado-Pan need not send any aid.Quite the opposite, in fact - I will be sending many of my followers on pilgrimage, to bring a message of hope to those in need.Thank you again, $p. Farewell."
4514,"All We Can Spare : Alright, I called in every favor I could. Here's what we got.Cho must be on to something big!Lemme know when you're ready to go see him - I got a ride all prepared for ya."
4515,"Pterrible Ptorment : One of the trolls' skyscreamers in Za'Tual is undergoing a ritual of torture, its will being bent forever to serve its masters.  Kill those that inflict such torment on the creature and we can only hope that it will return to the skies."
4516,"Moving On : Your journey in this land has already proven most eventful, traveler. And mine, it appears, is destined to continue for a time.A chain of events began when your people arrived here, and while some of those happenings are traumatic to behold, I feel there must be a larger purpose behind your presence.For now it is wisest that you leave this place and explore Pandaria's other regions.Speak to me when you are ready to leave."
4517,"The Torch of Strength : Xuen has this challenge he says helps ""refine strength."" I am starting to think the word ""strength"" means something different to him than the rest of us.Here, take this torch to the top of the gates of the temple. If you can get it there without the torch being extinguished, you pass the challenge.Whatever you do, do not try carrying the torch on a mount. It will blow out if you do. Trust me on that one."
4518,"Aggressive Notation : Even given the Sha's origins with the Old Gods, we in Pandaria still know very little of them.  I would like to take this opportunity to add whatever information I can about them to the archives of the Lorewalkers. Of course, that becomes a bit problematic when they're trying to kill us.  That doesn't seem to be a problem for you, though. Could you do me a favor and jot down some notes about what you encounter out there?  It could help a great deal towards understanding what we're fighting."
4519,"Charged Moganite : We have been dispatching spies into the Sunreaver base of operations on a daily basis. Some had orders to recover charged moganite from the enemy and bring it here.They have not returned, and I can confirm they have left the Sunreaver base.Search the jungle between here and there and find any of the charged moganite that might have been lost in transit. Bring it to me and we will put it to good use."
4520,"The Rabbitsfoot : The Broketooth hozen stole our Rabbitsfoot! He was the grummle with the biggest luckydo.This is very bad fortune indeed. Please, <race>, we need our Rabbitsfoot back. We need his good fortune back.Can you search the Broketooth Outpost for him?"
4521,"The Scryer's Dilemma : Since you were so helpful at the mines, would you be willing to help us with a small problem here at the temple?Wise Mari has been complaining recently of a disturbance in his temple.The water elementals have gotten quite playful recently, and made off with his ceremonial staff.If you could help him, I would be most grateful. I may even put in a word with the Jade Serpent for you.Just follow the path to the north."
4522,"They Grow Like Weeds : Ahh, it is you again, <name>.Instructor Windblade is looking for you. You can find her on the ridge to the east.She has some news about your cloud serpent."
4523,"The Missing Muskpaw : What the heck are you supposed to be? A <class>? Never heard of one of them. You here to help or to steal my yaks?Look, if yer' insistin' on helpin' out, go find my boy. He got himself grabbed by a bunch of sprites and probably doesn't even know we lost the ranch.They dragged him off to Pranksters' Hollow south east of here. Go rescue him an' I'll see about giving you a reward of some sort."
4524,
4525,"The Path of War : I see you want to save your friend. I can help you, if you will help me.First of all, it should be obvious that the fewer the Slingtail roaming around, the easier it will be to escape.Kill the hozen guards around us, and we will be one step closer to freedom."
4526,Make A Fighter Out of Me : Shhh! Don't speak so loudly! My father might hear you.<Shomi gestures to Steelbender Doshu.>My father is delusional! He thinks I should be studying my tea pouring while our village is under attack. It's ridiculous! I have just as much courage as any man. I just don't know how to fight... yet.That's where you come in. Let me travel with you! I'm a fast learner and I won't get in the way I promise!Pleaseeeeee!If we get separated I'll meet you back in the village.
4527,"Kypari Zar : What is that tree on the hill to the west? Can it be... Kypari Zar?<Korven the Prime lapses into silence.>When I returned from my final ravage, before being elevated to a paragon, I was given the honor of planting that very tree.I see it has grown into a great kypari, but... it seems something is amiss.There is an old sonar tower at the base of the tree. Take me there, Wakener. I can use the tower to take a closer look."
4528,"The Golden Lotus : The Golden Lotus have guarded the Vale for centuries, keeping it safe and hidden from harm.Recent events have unleashed terrible horrors upon our sacred vale, but allies of the Golden Lotus still stand against them, attempting to bring peace.If you wish to help, you had best join them at the Setting Sun Garrison."
4529,"The Challenger's Ring: Hawkmaster Nurong : You've really been building up respect with the Shado-Pan, <name>.  Nurong's interested in trying out his skills against you.  The good news is, if you win, I'll allow him to go with you on your missions.  The bad news is, I really don't think you'll win."
4530,"Scouting Report: Hostile Natives : I bet I know your first question: ""What the ook happened to Sergeant Gorrok?"" Don't worry, don't worry. He's totally alive. Not dead or anything.<Riko shuffles uncomfortably.>Well, we THINK he's alive, but he ALSO might be very, very dead.<Riko looks into your eyes for approval.>Fine! Let me tell you exactly what happened."
4531,"The Shadow of Doubt : A terrible manifestation of the sha has appeared to the south.It is trying to destroy an ancient relic, the Bell of a Thousand Whispers.This bell has never been rung in the temple's history, for it is rumored to be an ancient instrument of power.Please go and defeat this demon where it stands! We must save this relic!"
4532,
4533,
4534,"To Catch A Spy : Now, I could tell you who Connelly is, but that would be too easy! To catch a spy you have to think like a spy.You have to pass the test first!The small things can say a lot about a person. It's all in the details.I'm going to give you a drink to deliver. I will give you a small detail about something the recipient is wearing. From there it will be up to you.Be careful who you pick to give drinks to. People here tend to get pretty hostile if you give them the wrong order!"
4535,"Improvised Ammunition : I've got another job for you.The dragon cannons we depend on to keep the thicker swathes of mantid back are running low on ammo. The camp's cannoneers developed an improvised explosive that's made from the globe seeds down the western ridge.They dispatched a couple initiates to bring some back hours ago, but have heard nothing from them. I want to send someone a bit more capable to make sure that this gets taken care of.Are you my <man/woman> for this?"
4536,"Choking the Skies : Nurong wants me to pass out torches for burning the bodies.The flying mantid are fragile, and won't last long in the hot smoke."
4537,"Yellow and Red Make Orange : Uncle Chen says we're going to help this guy out with his virmen problem. Fine by me! I LOVE messing with virmen.Here's the plan: we're going to paint some turnips orange, and then we'll try to convince the virmen that they're carrots.This can only end in comedy.I'll gather turnips. You find something that we can use to make edible orange paint."
4538,"A Monkey Idol : Before, grummles keep hozen from ravaging by bribing with food.But now the Broketooth hozen south of here have their big magic idols. The Ook of Dook has trained them to use their idols to get power from sacrifices.They are using them to kill grummles!You must destroy these idols!For every idol, there is a chief. Kill the chief and throw corpse on their altar."
4539,Let Them Burn : Advance scouts report that the hozen at the Slingtail Pits are amassing with reinforcements from their tribes to the north.Our forces are gathered for battle on the ridge to the northwest. They are just waiting for you.Now is the time to show them what we are made of. Now is the time to destroy them indefinitely.
4540,"Seeking Father : I've searched everywhere... but I haven't found my father. I KNOW he's alive still. He just needs his crossbow... then he'll be OK.I've heard that you Shado-Pan guys sometimes fight the mantid on Sra'vess. I don't have any way of getting there. If you ever go over there, can you look for my dad?"
4541,"When The Dead Speak : The Shan'ze's experiments are overseen by a powerful necromancer known as a Shan'ze Deathspeaker.If we are to put an end to their operations, we must eliminate their leader."
4542,"Not in Chee-Chee's Backyard : Not all hozen are the same. Chee-Chee's tribe was forest hozen... came from Jade Forest. Pretty easy to get along with.The Kunzen invaders... they come from mountains, far to the north. Not nearly as nice as Chee-Chee.They come into our green land, take our things, leave big mess behind.Chee-Chee wants to kill them. You like to help?"
4543,"Heart Of The Alliance : I can't believe this has happened, <name>. After all we have been through here on Pandaria, will our people never learn from their past mistakes?Brann's expedition returned recently from Mogujia, bearing a sample of sha for study.I had my reservations about this endeavor in the first place, and my worst fears have been realized.The sha has escaped containment. I do not need to explain the horror of bringing the sha into the heart of the Vale.We must dispel any sha we can find, and quickly!"
4544,"Taking a Crop : Alright, fine. I DON'T have everything under control here. I spent all morning fighting off virmen. I managed to clear them off of my property, but they got away with some of my crops.They took them down to the river, to the south. I have no idea what they're doing with them, but it's probably not eating them.If my father wants his delivery now, I'm going to need some help getting those crops back. Could you help me out?"
4545,"Heart of the Swarm : We need to know what we're up against. Before we return to the Serpent's Spine, we should take the opportunity to scout the swarm.  I will fly us over the Heart of Fear. We should be able to survey Empress Shek'zara's forces from above. Then we can determine the extent to which N'Zoth has bolstered their ranks with his own."
4546,"Getting Permission : My love, Lo, tried to get permission to marry me from the pandriarchs. Though they have passed beyond, their favor would carry a lot of weight.Thing is, they are spirits, and none of the gifts or tributes we brought impress them. To win their favor they claimed that either Lo or a champion must defeat them in single combat.Lo is a good man, but not a fighter.Would you be our champion?"
4547,"Path Less Traveled : The toughest roads often have the most to teach us, <class>. I will no doubt learn a great deal from following the path of Shaohao.Many years ago Shaohao traveled to the highest peak in Kun-Lai to seek the guidance of the Jade Serpent. I too will travel to Seeker's Point in search of wisdom.Perhaps you would be interested in a journey such as this? If so speak with Uncle Cloverleaf. He will help you prepare."
4548,"Bind the Glamour : It has been a very, very long time since our tribe has been called on to perform this rite. I will do the best I can."
4549,The Taking of Dusklight Bridge : Let's press these insects back across the bridge and break their spirits!Follow my lead.
4550,"Cheng Bo! : Cheng Bo is the Warbringer of Fire Camp Gai-Cho. While you've made a dent in their operations, you now have an opportunity to strike a major blow.   Slay the Warbringer!"
4551,"Bolstering the Defenses : This island is a dangerous place, <name>. We have to worry about attacks from the Zandalari, mogu, saurok, and worst of all the Sunreavers.I had perimeter wards placed on the outskirts of our camp for additional protection. In their current state they will only injure an attacker, but I'm done with warnings!With your help we can super-charge the wards into a more deadly defense system."
4552,"The Pools of Youth : The mogu found the Pools of Youth!Mama Bramblestaff used to tell me old stories about those. During the mogu empire they would use the waters to extend life.Thing is those stories never ended well for some reason. As if the waters were cursed.Either way, we should investigate. There is a good chance those waters might help Leza.It looks like the Pools of Youth are on the northwestern side of the ruins."
4553,"A Gift For Chee Chee : That crazy Chee Chee is actually pretty neat. Mah always said that hozen were nothing but trouble, but... I guess he's just a better hozen then the rest of them.We should do something nice for him! Those mountain hozen in the west make some really fancy stir fry, and keep bowls of it inside their little hozen houses.I bet Chee Chee would love some!"
4554,"Back to the Sty : I try to keep an eye on my stock, but every once in a while some of them sneak away. With all the confusion these virmen are causing, I may have let my guard down for a few moments, and some of my pigs escaped.Care to look for them? I'd start by looking down the hill, to the west."
4555,The Ordo Warbringer : You've taken the shield down at Fire Camp Ordo. Go back there before the shield goes up again.Time to head into the cave and slay their chief!
4556,"Flight Training: Ring Round-Up : Now that your serpent is fully grown, you are ready to begin flight training.As with all novices, you must start at the beginning.Your first task is simple. Fly through 6 of the cloud rings between the spires to the east."
4557,A Very Nice Necklace : The beautiful necklace is only partly smudged by dirty hozen hands.There's only one person in the Valley who would own such a beautiful piece of jewelry.
4558,"Lupello : I've been thinking... the wolves might stop attacking if we kill their pack leader.We call him Lupello, and he patrols the opposite riverbank.<Francis' concentration is broken by another attack. Perhaps you should go deal with Lupello yourself.>"
4559,"The Serpent's Heart : You've done great here, kid. Thanks to you, we have quite a bit of extra jade, and I know just the someone who could use it.My friend Foreman Raike is running the great statue project at the Serpent's Heart.Bring a shipment of extra jade to him, and tell him his old friend Mann says hello. He'll be eagerly waiting your arrival."
4560,"The Anglers : If you want to explore all the secrets of the deep ocean, and catch some big fish, speak to Haito at the Anglers Wharf in Krasarang Wilds.I'm sure he'd love to show you a thing or two about reeling!"
4561,"Fractured Forces : The Horde have made our jobs easier for us. Their infighting and segregation have split their camp in two: orcs in the west, and undead in the east.The orcs obey their commander Dalgan, while the undead follow Bellandra Felstorm, a powerful warlock. Hopefully, their internal squabbles will be enough of a distraction that you'll be able to sneak in there and kill both of them. Sully has already infiltrated the ruins; find him inside when you are done."
4562,"Bloodied Skies : We have cannons set up on the top of the towers flanking the main gate. They are our best method to clear the skies when the flying mantid try to pass over the wall, like they are now.Looks like you're on, <name>."
4563,"The Horde Is Family : This hearthstone was part of a conversation Vol'jin and I shared a long time ago.He believes his people are in danger. I don't know what all has transpired in my absence, but I can at least do this for my friend.Come, $p, travel with me to the Echo Isles. We must make sure that the Darkspear are safe."
4564,"The Shado-Pan : Our new recruits have spoken in hushed tones about a group of Pandaren they call the ""Shado-Pan"". They are apparently very strong, and secretive.  It's clear that, no matter what happens here in Kun-Lai, making an alliance with these Shado-Pan will be critical to our foothold in Pandaria.  That's where you come in. Rumor is they have a base of operations to the southeast, near Firebough Nook.  You will go there, and curry their favor. For the Horde!"
4565,"The Warren-Mother : We've dealt with the alpha males. Now, the alpha female.Virmen aren't terribly selective when it comes to breeding, but most broods will still have a dominant mother figure. She's usually bigger, meaner, and tougher than anyone else in the brood.You know, I wouldn't mind testing my skills against a warren-mother. Mind if I fight alongside you?"
4566,"The Assault on Zeb'tula : Our scouting efforts along the coast have given us valuable intelligence about the island, <class>.However, we will accomplish nothing if we do not advance forward onto the mainland.I have assembled a team of our most elite aerial units to begin the attack.I would like you to join the assault. A champion such as yourself could turn the battle in our favor at the critical moment.When you are ready to begin the attack, speak to me."
4567,"The Search for the Hidden Master : Oh, hello. Are you looking for the owner of this place? Then look to the pandaren up at the top of the stairs.I'm just a visitor... like you.Now if you'll excuse me, my friends and I are trying to decide something. We can talk again afterwards."
4568,Down Kitty! : I tried to fight one of the jade tigers in the woods but they were too scary. They stare at you and you turn to a jade statue!Honest truth! Chen's sister's friend Ni heard it from Kai's mom.I want to be brave like you though. Can you show me how to beat up those jade tigers?
4569,"Stalling the Ravage : The Kunzen hozen, up in the mountains to the west, have been acting up, lighting their fires and shouting their chants. Based on what I've heard and seen around here, that means that a ravage is coming.There's not much we can do to stop the ravage, but we can at least thin their numbers before they attack."
4570,A Wing to Fly On : I've just received a report that another young pterrorwing has been spotted in the Diremoor.We need to recover as many of these as we can find. They may be the key to flying on this island.
4571,"Boom Bait : There. I've plastered your bird guts over my explosives.I call 'em Gut Bombs, patent pending.Since you made friends with these fellas, how about you do the honors?Just light the fuse and throw 'em down by the shoreline!"
4572,"A Spear Through My Side, A Chain Through My Soul : My fate is sealed. The yaungol put this spear in my side. The wound will kill me.The yaungol hold me in place with their twisted, corrupted magic. The indignity of it hurts worse than my spear-wound.My death, I cannot stop. My imprisonment... you may be able to help me with this."
4573,"Hostile Skies : We're about to get hit hard... Pick up that cannon there and lend a hand, if you would.  There will be no shortage of targets."
4574,"Destroy the Siege Weapons! : The mantid don't just attack in swarms.   They're smart. They use alchemy, bombs... and what's worst, they've got siege weapons. Those have the potential to be incredibly destructive if they attack with them.  We've got reports that they're building up a force of siege weapons to the west at Sra'vess. Go and destroy them."
4575,"De-Constructed : Saurok consistently test our borders, and our constructs usually fend them off. Some constructs, however, have been defeated and dragged back to Ihgaluk Crag.I want those constructs back. No slithering lizard will steal Silver Covenant property under my watch."
4576,"Captain Jack's Dead : Gore from Captain Jack's head drips and mysteriously seeps into the ground as you examine your hard-won trophy.Strange, but no time to investigate that now. There's too much work to be done.The chieftain of your newfound friends will doubtlessly be impressed with this proof of your grookin' skills."
4577,"Dog Food : <Dog whines as best as a lion seal can, feebly lifting one flipper toward his massive jaws.He's hungry.The Shelf of Mazu is covered in rockshell makrura that should make a fine meal for him.>"
4578,"The Big Brew-haha : It's a disaster, <name>!When I went to visit the Dancing Serpent Inn yesterday, they were all out of brew. They said the shipment from Sri-La Village had been stolen. STOLEN!Turns out those Oona hozen have been making all kinds of trouble down at the docks, including taking all the brew to their cave at Oona Kagu along the coast.I can't handle a dry spell. A life without brew is not a life worth living!Someone needs to go and save the brew!"
4579,"Bad Yak : Is this the place where they replace defective yaks?Can anybody help me out, here?"
4580,"The Warlord's Ashes : <Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver defeated Warlord Gurthan centuries ago, but the mogu beastmaster's spirit continues to haunt the ruins of his old stronghold.Showing proof of your victory over this spirit may gain you favor in the eyes of the Klaxxi.>"
4581,"Stoneplow Thirsts : Excuse me... <name>? Did I hear your name correctly?I've come from Stoneplow, in the west. They sent me to pick up some emergency beer rations, but the Stormstout Brewery is all boarded up!It looks like your handsome friend there - no, not Mudmug, the other one - has a few casks with him. Could you spare a keg for a town in need?"
4582,"Westwind Rest : <Admiral Taylor winces in pain.>  Jade Forest was a disaster.   Anduin's gone. We lost some good people. We didn't stop the Horde from advancing into the continent.   But I think I've found a way to get the locals on our side. You just helped fight off some of these ""yaungol"", no?  I hear yaungol sacked Westwind Rest, a local village. We've been told that two groups of survivors have camped out along the road west out of town.  We help them out, maybe they'll consider siding with the Allliance."
4583,"In Search of Wisdom : Lorewalker Cho came by and asked for you while you were gone.He needs your assistance urgently in the town of Dawn's Blossom to the north. For what reason, he did not say.Speak to Kitemaster Ut-Nam. He would be happy to send you there."
4584,"The Head : Monkey King receive word on where to find the head,The hozen who got it has long since been dead. Kunzen chiefs pass the relic from father to son, But then virmen Skiggit came and the head it won. Now the wikket worships it in a hollow. Since it was too ookin' big for him to swallow. I sent a royal finder north to find him and stand. Look for finder in mountains west of the Heartland."
4585,"The Rider's Journey : Excellent, just excellent! I will return the other eggs to their nests, undisturbed.In the meantime, deliver your egg to Instructor Skythorn at The Arboretum."
4586,"The Heartland Legacy : At the very bottom of the treasure chest, you find a stack of scrolls and a soft leather sack with seeds.Unrolling the scrolls, you see they contain detailed farming notes, drawings of plants, numbers and calculations, locations of nearby water springs, and countless other snippets.There might be someone at the Tillers Union who would like to see this."
4587,"The ""Jinyu Princess"" Irrigation System : <The back of the box features a caricature of a jinyu maiden surrounded by marketing copy.>""Hey there, greenthumb. Are you pouting over parched pumpkins? Crying over crusty cabbage? Are your leeks lame and your melons melancholy?Then it's time you brought home the Jinyu Princess! She'll wash over your garden like a sweet spring rain, dousing that drought with a deep draught of...""<It goes on like this for six paragraphs.>"
4588,"A Trail of Fear : You now know Niuzao's secret. We are not only the wardens of this temple... we were the wardens of the Sha of Fear that was buried beneath it.The Sha itself may have escaped... but it left traces behind. If you're truly going down into the catacombs, you should eliminate those traces, before they escape and cause greater problems than those we already face."
4589,"A Seemingly Endless Nuisance : I apologize for the state of things around here. The virmen - those rabbity creatures, down the hill - have been pushing further and further into my family's farm, and our crops - which are normally bigger, and more delicious, by the way - have been suffering because of it.I'm no soldier... but you might be! Would you mind pushing some of these virmen off of our land?"
4590,"The Rumpus : Master Stone Fist has trained you in the art of one-on-one combat. Now you learn the art of one-on-many.How does fifty sound?Lower yourself into the Ring of Inner Focus below, then, when you're ready, set off this firework. My assistants will come at you, several at a time.All you need to do is survive."
4591,"Family Heirlooms : We recently lost a fierce battle against the hozen at Moonwater Retreat.We evacuated as many of our people as we could, but still, there were many we could not save.We have no tokens of our lost over which to send our prayers.If someone could go and retrieve heirlooms from the dead bodies, we could properly lay them to rest, and move on.It would mean so much to us if you could do this, <name>."
4592,"Fiery Wings : I think that old paper said something about ""fiery wings."" Those little dragons around here have wings. They're kind of fiery, in a way.You're quicker than me. Try catching some of those dragons... or at least slapping the powder off of them.No point in killing a harmless little dragon, if all you want is the sparkle from their wings."
4593,"Defiance : The damn mogu hit us out of nowhere! Anyone they don't kill on sight is being dragged away into the woods.This is the only safehouse, and its all I can do to hold the door.What do you say, friend? Are you willing to stand up and fight for the weak?"
4594,Dread Space : Shado-Pan marksmen keep a constant watch over the Dread Wastes from the top of the Serpent's Spine. They would surely welcome the aid of a skilled <class> such as yourself.Take a kite and check in with Bowmistress Li.
4595,"Ranger Rescue : I must ask a most important task of you, <name>.Somewhere among the cages in the Osul camp is my husband, Lin. He is the light of my world.Please find him and return him to me, and save as many of our fellow Shado-Pan as you can as well.You should find keys to those cages on the Osul Marauders."
4596,"Sampling the Empire's Finest : The wonders of the kypari sap never cease to amaze me. Among its numerous properties and applications, the sap can be refined into a nutritious and extremely delectable elixir.Nowhere in the Empire will you find a finer execution of this brew than the palace itself. Surely, the homes of the loyalists have feeders brimming with this sweet nectar.Fill this jar at their feeders and return it to me. I long to sample the imperial ambrosia once more."
4597,Hit Medicine : Our warriors are fighting to keep the yaungol at bay in the Kun-Lai Pass to the northwest.Take this liniment.  It is a powerful medicine that has been passed down in my family over the generations.Use the dit da jow to heal the injured warriors if you do not have healing powers of your own to use on them.
4598,Roadside Assistance : A luckydo remembers to bring incense on a journey in to the mountains. The smellier the luck the better.Can you journey up the road to One Keg and light the incense you find along the way?This will give good fortune to grummles that must travel the road.Brother Lintpocket can give you many rewards. Speak to him when you arrive.
4599,"They Stole My Luck! : My journeys through Kun-Lai have taught me two things. First, never sneak up on a sleeping yak. Second, having luck on your side is both necessary and hard to come by.The grummles believe in carrying a lucky trinket at all times. In my mind, if one trinket can sometimes bring luck, then many trinkets would guarantee it!After arriving in One Keg my lucky trinkets were stolen by those little menace sprites. I'd be truly grateful if you could retrieve them for me."
4600,"Champion of Chi-Ji : While you will always hold a place of honor among our order, you are still welcome to participate in our duels.One of our current champions awaits you in the Dome Balrissa. I know that they would be honored to duel with you."
4601,"To the Valley! : This sealed communication was sent for you, along with urgent orders to travel to the Valley of Emperors in Kun-Lai Summit.  This looks serious. I'd not delay if I were you.Speak to Tak-Tak for transportation."
4602,
4603,"Cut Off the Heads : Okay. We're stuck in the middle of three mogu armies, and Uncle Chen is too hurt to move yet.  It's not hopeless though. We have the chance to take out the leaders of these armies. Maybe that will slow them down or distract them long enough for us to get back to the gate!  See if you can get out there and take down the biggest, baddest mogu you can find. Those will be the commanders."
4604,"Up In Flames : The mantid coming across the bridge have thick carapaces that shrug off most of our attacks. They have a weakness though: fire.Lao-Chen's men brought kegs to the battlefield for exactly this purpose.  Kick the kegs into groups of mantid, and Lao-Chin's archers will light them up.They should be easy to finish off from there."
4605,"A Wolf In Sheep's Clothing : AAAIIIIEEUUGGHHHH!!!! This is the last straw!Those stupid hozen on the mountain killed my SHEEPIE!I know exactly who did this, and it is time for REVENGE.If you are willing to help me, take this old sheepskin.Use it to disguise yourself anywhere on the mountain to the north, wait for that little dooker Krungko to come out of hiding, and then break his bones!"
4606,"Welcome Wagons : Did you see the size of those war wagons? They're packing so many explosives, I cannae tell if the Horde is here to take over this continent or just blow it out of the sea!We need to neutralize those wagons before they leave Garrosh'ar Point.Here, take me pocket flares. Fire 'em into a wagon and watch the fireworks!"
4607,"Crouching Carrot, Hidden Turnip : Uncle Chen's still got his eye on me, which means I won't be wandering off any time soon. I guess it's up to you to take these turnips... I mean, ""carrots""... into the Twisted Warren and deliver them for me.It should be pretty simple. Just toss the vegetables in front of virmen, then watch their reaction when they find out it's really a turnip!"
4608,The Great Banquet : The banquet should be starting any time now. Go find the High Elder and pay your respects. I'll be right behind you.
4609,"They Don't Even Wear Them : A few weeks ago, a group of those jumpy little Springtail virmen broke into my lockbox and stole several handfuls of my jewelry. I've since found a few pieces, but they still have most of my collection.If you're headed up to the Springtail Crag, in the cliffs to the north, you should keep an eye out for them. I'd love to get my jewelry back."
4610,"Grummle! Grummle! Grummle! : Now that grummles are rescued, we need to rescue our supplies.The Ook of Dook is only chief because he has supplies.Go to the Dooker Dome area north west of here. Take some grummles with you. Keep them safe and get them near supply crates.Grummles know what to do from there.Rabbitsfoot and I will meet you there."
4611,Chasing the Storm : We need to figure out where they are taking the Thunder King's remains. It won't be possible for them to resurrect him in the Valley of the Emperors. They would need to be somewhere remote and secure.It appears that getting out of here may also prove to be a challenge....Fight your way out and look for information concerning the location of the remains.
4612,"Preserved in Amber : Take... this...<The dying mantid struggles to outstretch his arm. In his mangled grasp rests a metal fork with two long, thin prongs and an ornately jeweled handle.>Awaken... the Wind-Reaver...It is the only way... to end the swarm."
4613,"Weeping Widows : The spiders near Sri-La Village have grown very aggressive. They pose a severe problem to the anglers who fish along the coast.For their safety, I need you to go and eliminate the Weeping Widows in The Widow's Wail.You can find the cave along the coast to the north."
4614,"The Ritual : From the moment I first rose from the river, I knew I was destined to be Waterspeaker.  I was taught many rituals, and have performed all of them, save one.  There was one, an extremely ancient one, that we were told to call upon if our people ever turned against us.   This must have happened in our people's distant past, because we haven't needed to use it in our village's memory.  I suppose now is the time to do so."
4615,"The Leader Hozen : The time has come to face the Ook of Dook. We beat him, and the hozen won't have someone telling them to ravage.Here is the plan: Yakshoe will lead Tassle in to arena and scare away Chomp Chomp.Then, you sneak in and fight the Ook of Dook while his hozen are distracted by the yeti rampaging through their home.We'll meet you back at Kota Basecamp with a big reward. Good fortune to you, friend of grummles."
4616,"The Burlap Trail: To Kota Basecamp : This here's hozen lands. Very dangerous. But grummles must trek through. Supplies must reach the Serpent's Spine.Go, protect the next wave of grummles on their trek to Kota Basecamp.If at least one survives, good fortune will find its way to you."
4617,"The Fate of Dalaran : Jaina is refusing to hear me out. Father was hoping I would have some pull with her, but I think she still sees me as a child.You, on the other hand, are a hero of the Alliance and I know she respects your deeds.Is there something you can say to her to convince her we need her help?"
4618,
4619,"Needle Me Not : The Arboretum is our home, a safe haven where we raise young hatchlings and train our students.Unfortunately, there are other, more dangerous creatures who wish to make this their home as well.To the north, beyond the river, we have seen a great wasp feeding on the nectar blossoms.This creature has already stung several of our students.Use this honey to lure the wasp out of hiding. Then, destroy it before it harms anyone else."
4620,
4621,
4622,"Enemies At Our Door : The Zandalari have begun their attack! You must help defend the village!If we can't push them back, we will never find the Thunder King's remains!"
4623,"The Bigger They Come... : Killing the smaller mantid works mostly as a distraction. It forces them to replenish their numbers before they consider any serious offensive.  The big ones, though - we kill a few of those, and we really disrupt operations on the island. That buys ourselves a substantial amount of time. With mantid, it's like their size is directly proportional to their importance in the empire.  So kill some of the big ones for me, while you're out there."
4624,"The Jade Witch : The Jade Witch must still have Shin.I... I can't do it! I don't want to see the witch. Can you please go talk to her and see if she has Shin?You're an adult, I don't think she would try to turn you into jade."
4625,"Cheer Up, Yi-Mo : Ever since this storm began, I've just been... tired.Not physically... no. It's like my very soul is exhausted. Worthless. Hopeless. I imagine it's what one feels when a mate leaves them for someone with a rounder belly, but I've never had a mate so how would I know?How can I claim to know anything? I'm worthless to everyone but these thunderbirds. At least they'll have a good meal out of me.<Yi-Mo sighs deeply and continues staring off into the sky. It doesn't look like he's going anywhere.>"
4626,"Saur Loser : Inside the Beast Pens you will encounter some of the most skilled beast tamers in the Zandalari military. They are trained to kill with axe, beast, and claw. This is where they build their cavalry.We need you to kill any Zandalari you find in the Beast Pens before they can get their mounted monstrosities out into the open battlefield."
4627,
4628,"Dead Zone : A Klaxxi'va whispers to the tower. It carries their whisper far; to other towers, to mantid, to paragons. The whisper bounces back, and the Klaxxi hear it.This way, they see all.A tower near the palace is quiet. This will not do. It must sing for the Klaxxi.It is my job to fix the tower, but if you serve the Klaxxi, you should serve me as well. You fix the tower, and I will wait here!"
4629,
4630,"The Battle Ring : We have some fresh trainees that are far from being a danger to you, but in numbers, they may prove enough of a challenge. And if not, they could use the lesson in humility.Step into the battle ring when you're ready. Don't go easy on them."
4631,"Tear Down This Wall! : The time has come. Our forces are well-enough entrenched here that we can risk pressing forward, into the Thunder King's lair. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like he'll be opening that gate anytime soon.I suppose we'll have to make a gate of our own then. Let me know when you're ready, <name>."
4632,
4633,"Sentry Wards : We've spotted heavy air support over their base, in the form of way too many dwarves on way too many griffons. Means we can't get any vision of the area from above.  A troll... friend of mine gave us a set of Sentry Wards, which we can use to spy on their base and get a vantage point on what's going on in there.  Bad news, friend - you're going to be the one going in there."
4634,"Hero's Call: Townlong Steppes! : All able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Taran Zhu in Townlong Steppes.  The Shado-Pan want to reclaim their land from the clutches of the yaungol, but lack the numbers to do so.  Assist them with their assault against the yaungol.  Glory to the Alliance!"
4635,"What's in the Box? : We are trying to uncover the secrets of one of the mogu artifacts Garrosh insisted we investigate. It is proving most difficult, as anyone who probes it magically is greatly affected by raw, negative emotions.I called in the assistance of Arch-mage Aethas of the Sunreavers in the hopes that he and Rommath could crack this puzzle. They asked for you specifically - apparently you have some relevant experience?Go to the chamber below Farstrider Square east of here and see if you can assist them."
4636,"The Third Riddle: Strength : The mallet you seek is not a toy for children,It calls trouble like the song of a siren.A test of strength the Monkey King will require,Before you receive this tool of your desire.At the Temple of the White Tiger you will findA challenger to test how well you are resignedStep through the main door and then turn right down the rampChallenge the ook waiting for you there like a champ!"
4637,"Emptier Nests : Oh, thank goodness, another cloud serpent trainer!I just received word that the wild hatchlings at Windward Isle to the northeast are in serious trouble!While the adults fight those terrible saurok, who is watching the cute little babies? No one, that's who!WE HAVE TO SAVE THEM!I'm sending every trainer I can find to go and help. If you aren't too busy, can you make sure the hatchlings are safely delivered back to their mothers' nests?"
4638,Warchief's Command: Jade Forest! : All able-bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to General Nazgrim in Orgrimmar.  Recent victories in our naval battles against the Alliance strengthens our resolve.  Report to Grommash Hold and assist the Horde's invasion fleet.  For the Horde!
4639,"The Quest for Better Barley : Looking for sweet grain? My father once mentioned a malted cave barley that sounds about right.If you are willing to brave the peril, there is an ancient cave at the base of the Winds' Edge south of here.There is even an old lift my father made when he would travel into the jungle.In the cave is a bush as old as my family. From that bush you can pluck a grain so sweet it will humble your senses.Just watch out for its guardians."
4640,"Pest Problems : One of my farmhands, Wika-Wika, has been tilling the soil in my westernmost field. I understand he's had some problems with pests.He's got plenty of pesticide to spray the bugs that eat my crops, but I'm afraid he has no way to deal with the marmots.Would you lend him a hand? With rampant hozen and virmen attacks, I can't afford to lose crops to simple pests."
4641,"Blinding the Riverblades : ""A hooded falcon catches no quarry.""This is one of the first mantras we teach young monks at the temple. It means that even a foe as swift and lethal as a falcon can be neutralized by depriving its senses.The saurok have scouts all over the region acting as eyes for their raiding parties.It's time we put their eyes out, don't you think?"
4642,"A Strange Appetite : Food. I must have food.In my time, the meat of the starfish brought not only strength, but also clarity of mind. This is what I must eat.Bring this to me from the nearby shallows.Wait much longer, and I will devour you instead."
4643,"Seeing Red : Ahead of us is the main thrust of the yaungol army.Here, they prepare their vast army to attack the villages of Kun-Lai.If we strike at the Osul now, we can cut them at their very core.Remember, for every of their number that we strike down here, we save one of our own back at home."
4644,Heroes of the Shado-Pan : You said that Taran Zhu is in Townlong and was asking for me?  Must be something important...
4645,Where Silk Comes From : Would you like to be a Silkmaster for a day?The first thing you'll need are fresh mulberry leaves. You can find them in our grove of mulberry bushes to the northwest.Next you will need to feed them to a hungry silkworm in our feeding pit to the west.And finally you should get some raw silk from our processing hut on the south side of our farm.Have fun!
4646,"Kang Bramblestaff : Kang's pride regularly becomes overconfidence, which often leads him down dangerous paths. His current path is as dangerous as any - he is headed deep into the Krasarang Wilds.I wouldn't normally ask a favor of a stranger, but... would you make sure that he is well? It would give me relief to know that a brave <race> was looking out for him."
4647,"Potency : To make the Dream Brew, we will need several ingredients.First, to improve its strength, I will need an ingredient from a fearsome creature, the legendary Mist Horror.It is said that this creature only appears where the fog is deepest.North and east of here, you will find smaller Mist Creepers roaming the swamps. Kill these creatures until the Mist Horror appears, and then bring me its heart."
4648,"The Tomb of Shadows : Given the artifacts you found on the altar, I would guess they were attempting to perform a Spiritbinding ritual.Most of the texts involving Spiritbinding were locked away in the Tomb of Shadows. Perhaps we will find the answers we seek there.Look for anything that might help us. You'll find the tomb on the first rise closest to the ritual altar."
4649,The Lorewalkers : So you are interested in learning more of the lore of this land?Very well! You should speak to Lorewalker Cho at the Seat of Knowledge.He can be found in the room above the entrance to the Mogu'shan Palace. Speak with Mishi for a ride.
4650,
4651,"Spirit Dust : The spirits that the Yaungol are entrapping from the remains of their ancestors still have a bit of the essence of life within them.   If you defeat the spirits in battle, you can collect essence from the spirits as dust, and then return it to the corpses in the area, which will send the spirits, finally, to the next life.  This is the only way to set right what the Deadtalkers have done. It will also help keep us safe."
4652,"A Courteous Guest : I heard, I heard! The High Elder wants you to train with us!There's going to be a banquet for us, the trainees... and you should probably bring a gift, as a sign of courtesy.The oranges in the grove south of the temple are extra-sweet right now. Bring some back, for the banquet."
4653,"Resupplying One Keg : If you're looking for the best supplies in Kun-Lai you've come to the right place! Oh sure, it looks a bit empty. Don't let appearances deceive you..Oh, who am I kidding?! Between the hozen attacks, and the sprites pillaging what few supplies we do get, my stock has dwindled to a dangerous level.If you could help me recover some of my supplies I should have enough to contribute to your journey."
4654,"To the Wall! : They are attacking again!  <Lin looks to the Ox Gate.>  Archers... on the wall!  I need you to get up there. My wife Suna went to scout the wall with that fool Lao-Chen. Perhaps if he had spent more time preparing defenses and less building that ridiculous ale lift contraption...  It matters not. Get a kite from Len, to the west, and then get up there and find my wife. She'll know what to do next."
4655,
4656,
4657,Another One Bites the Dust : The Alliance have planted themselves off our southern coast and continue to pepper our ground forces with cannon fire. Let us see how great their siege is without such support.Board the enemy vessels and destroy their reserve ammunition. This will take the teeth out of their bite.
4658,"The Trainer's Challenge: Big Bao : Are you ready for another lesson, <name>?Today, you will spar against Big Bao. He is large of stature and of heart, and he will not give up until he is wholly beaten.If you wish to defeat him, you will need to persevere.Speak to him in the training ring to begin the challenge. Good luck."
4659,"Envoy of the Alliance : North of this base is a cherry blossom orchard and a village tucked away behind it. We will need to quarter there and tend to our wounded while we plan our next move.Head to that village and make contact with the native leader. Agent Mishka and I will rendezvous with you there.Be courteous, <name>! I am authorizing you to represent the entire Alliance here.I'm banking that seeing a powerful Alliance hero like you should make a favorable impression."
4660,"Face to Face With Consequence : I do not know the history of this war that you fight, and I am not interested. This land responds to negative energy in kind. The hatreds, doubt, and violence you have brought here now ooze out of Pandaria like blood from an open wound.Your actions have wrought havoc all over these ruins! Clean up after yourself and meet me in the village below - I will do my best to explain what is happening here."
4661,"Rampaging Rodents : I went off this morning to watch my papa fight the virmen. When I came back, the farm was full of marmots!I don't want to kill them, but we need to get rid of them. Hey, I know! We can close the holes!Fill in their holes with dirt, so they can't come out in our farm anymore."
4662,"Critical Condition : We may have won the first battle, but a critical task still remains.Dozens of Skyfire pilots were shot down during the initial aerial battle.Without medical aid, their condition will deteriorate over time, until they finally perish. We are their only hope for survival.Go into the orchard and revive as many pilots as you can find.We will leave no one behind."
4663,"Hozen Love Their Keys : The hozen have a yeti! They call it Old Poot Poot and keep it at the back of their cave.Hozen are normally scared of yeti, but now they feed it grummles.They have a Hunter Chief, Cho Cho the Wicked. Can you see if he has a key on him to the yeti shackles?Bad fortune for hozen if a yeti is loose in their fort."
4664,"Seein' Red : I was just about ta curl up an' die, mon.Now, dis!Snuff an' me go way back. Oh, da memories...No way I can face Snuff in da afterlife without avengin' his death first, mon!Dese hooligans be led by one named Konk. We gotta sniff him out an' den snuff him out - for Snuff!"
4665,"Courting Destiny : The Vision of Time is nearly perfected, we now have much more control over the visions we seek. Your efforts have been instrumental in completing the artifact and restoring the strength of not only my flight, but also our allies in the Timewalkers. All of us are in your debt.Quite fortunately, I have located a sort of crux in time - an intersection of timeways - right here in Pandaria. Take the Vision of Time to the Temple of the White Tiger. There, in the cellars, turn the hourglass."
4666,"Smoke Before Fire : Sully scouted the Horde establishment to the north, and he reports seeing a large pile of explosives, along with a small force of demolishers. That's not to mention the demons that their warlocks have summoned.Luckily, we came prepared. We've got air support from the Skyfire. We just need to show our pilots where to strike.<Rell hands you a smoke flare, and gives you a knowing nod.>"
4667,"Pristine Sound Beacon : This artifact has been restored to a remarkably excellent condition.  Perhaps you will put it on display at the Seat of Knowledge, so that lorewalkers and archaeologists can study it."
4668,"Understanding The Shado-Pan : The Shado-Pan rank among Pandaria's oldest defenders.For years we train in our snow-capped monastery high in the Kun-Lai Summit, perfecting the martial secrets passed down by our ancestors.Our numbers may seem few, but a single Shado-Pan can be deadlier than a hundred trained soldiers.To join the Shado-Pan order is a long journey full of hardship. If this is the path you seek, then you must first prove your worth.There is urgent work to be done here. Help the Golden Lotus defend the Vale."
4669,"Jailbreak : Without healing, your friend Taylor will die. My village is just east of here, in the middle of the large lake.I will take Taylor myself, but the fighting is most dangerous in that direction.I need you to help clear a path through the hozen, so that I may run safely into my village.Can you do this?"
4670,"Bigger Fish to Fry : I've prepared a team of bright young Pearlfin trainees who need field experience.Take them northeast, into the Bamboo Wilds, and kill any wildlife that you find.Don't bring them back until they're fit for battle."
4671,"The Mantidote : <Mei motions towards the battlefield.>You see those huge mantid commanders out there? They have a strange aura about them. It reminds me of the sadness we saw at Zhu's Watch.Perhaps... they're under the influence of the sha, too?I kept Ken-Ken's mask - the one he used to remove the sha from Yi-Mo. I believe that, if we use it on the mantid, we can convince them to turn back."
4672,"Bound With Wood : <Vu eyes the recipe.>Hmm... ""bound with wood"". We don't typically brew with wood. Sap, yes... but not wood.We have, on rare occasions, infused our drinks with corewood from the treants to the west of here. Most of them have fallen to the mantid... but their remains should suffice for our recipe."
4673,"Helping the Cause : Welcome back, <name>! It seems the Jinyu have taken to our training even better than I had hoped. We're in the final stages of our preparations now.I need someone to go check in with Amber, Bold Karasshi, and Mishka. See if they need any help to complete their training.You'll find Karasshi and Mishka here in Pearlfin Village. Amber is training recruits in Slingtail Pits to the northwest."
4674,Evie Stormstout : I was too late. She was so small... and I was too late.She should be given a proper burial. A little warrior like her deserves better than this.
4675,"Research Project: The Pandaren Empire : Ah, adventurer. You come at a most opportune time. My daughter and I are researching the history of our people and have hit a roadblock in our research.Should you come across fragments of the pandaren past, please, bring them to us here. We would benefit greatly from the additional information."
4676,"The Golden Dream : Ashyo must have experienced what we call the golden dream.Many of us working here have seen it, too - often after a long day of toiling in the pools. It is said this vision--and the feeling of elation it brings--is a reward to the mind for working the body.There IS an easier way, though we rarely resort to it anymore: a tea can be brewed using lotus root and dreamleaf, which grows around the shrine on the upper tier.Bring the dreamleaf to Yan back in town and he can brew the tea for you."
4677,"Enraged Vengeance : <The Swordmistress does not look well. There's a darkness to her eyes uncharacteristic of the pandaren.>I don't think I've ever been as... as furious as now. What betrayal!I fought them off when they attacked, killed a few here, but Merchant Shi is too much of a coward to let me go and finish the job!You, do it for me. Kill them. Kill them all."
4678,"Darnassus Attacked? : As you know, our night elven allies moved the Divine Bell you retrieved to Darnassus for safekeeping and study. Moments ago, they portaled some Highbourne mages over here to ask for backup. Details are hazy - some sort of stealth attack on the city?I don't know what to make of it, but Jaina Proudmoore is already on the scene and I suspect they need all the help they can get.Speak to Seamus Goldenkicks over there for a quick portal to Darnassus. Find Jaina!"
4679,"Shark Week : Crabbing is our big money-maker, but we send all kinds of goods back around the wall. Oils, plants, even rare minerals - the sea's bounty is rich out here!Right now the big craze in the markets back home is thresher teeth. Apparently they make great necklaces?Threshers are all over the Shelf of Mazu to the west. Bring me lots of teeth!"
4680,"Beastmaster's Hunt: The Crab : Along with the crate, you get some advice on crab hunting:Crabs are strange, old creatures, with different motivations than us.Small crabs are easy to find and hunt, but the big ones hide beneath the sands, out of danger and out of our reach. To draw them out, we play on their sense of smell.The Unga villagers to the southwest allow their fish to ferment before they eat them. Bring enough rotten fish together, and you will catch yourself a colossal crab."
4681,
4682,
4683,"Scouting Report: Like Jinyu in a Barrel : With our leader turned to jade, our hozen guide disappeared, and a prisoner of war in tow, there was only one thing that Kiryn and I could do:March into our enemy's territory and deliver some vengeance.Want to know how it went?"
4684,"The Waters of Youth : She is headstrong, my little Lyalia. I should have known she would try to challenge the Lord Reclaimer.Since her mother died, I forsook much of the time I should have spent with her in search of immortality, insisting that we could live forever, together.And now my obsession has cost my little Lyalia her life.Please, $p, when she wakes, tell her I love her."
4685,"They're So Thorny! : The crate, once full of desperately needed supplies, has been thoroughly pillaged.A quick scan of the area shows evidence left behind by the thieves. Icy thorns, just like the ones on the water sprites on the shoreline to the east.This is a life or death situation for your band of survivors. Those supplies need to be retrieved from these thieving pests and returned to camp."
4686,"Tiny Treats : As you near, your serpent opens its mouth and begins drooling. It looks quite hungry since you last left it.From the way it whimpers and slaps its tail, you can tell it is not looking for just any treat, but a special favorite snack.Your serpent loves to munch on tiny spider eyes, but this delicacy comes only from the Widowspawn spiders in the cave along the coast to the north.Well, what's a rider to do? Your serpent is waiting."
4687,"Work Order: Operation: Shieldwall I : <Yoon's writing decorates the page though his feelings seem conflicted.>I normally try to stay out of conflict, but an order is an order. Since you are of the Alliance I decided to pass this order your way.Operation: Shieldwall has requested a whole heap of witchberries.I can't be sure, but I think they have an idea to use them in some sort of weapon."
4688,"Damage Control : Kor'ik has been sending signals to the empress for weeks. Everything the Klaxxi have done, the empress knows about.That stops now!Kypari Ik will be the first to receive news of Kor'ik's demise. It would benefit us to make sure that message does not make it to the empress.Destroying the whisperers and beacon there will buy us enough time to come up with a plan before the empress can act."
4689,"The Challenger's Ring: Lao-Chin the Iron Belly : Lao-Chin seems to have his head in the clouds... or, rather, in his beer.  After all of his recent battles, he seems completely obsessed with with trying to develop the perfect brew for fighting.   That's well and good, but we need him to actually do some fighting!  You should go challenge him, see if you can snap him out of his rut.   If you beat him, he'll probably want to go out and help fight just to try to one-up you!"
4690,Wee Little Shenanigans : So... we bought some cheap grains in bulk. It turned out the grain was infested with sprites.I HATE sprites. With their wee beady eyes and constant smiling.I would like to resolve this quietly. Can I buy your services to discreetly eliminate some of these grain thieves?
4691,
4692,"Where It Counts : I've been watching those Kunzen hozen, and I've noticed a consistent pattern. Whenever they're getting ready to attack, they participate in strange, barbaric rituals around their totem.If we can disrupt this ritual, not only will we put off any impending attacks, we can deal a huge blow to their morale! So get in there, rough them up, and make as much of a mess as possible!"
4693,"SI:7 Report: Lost in the Woods : <Rell coughs heavily before speaking.>Please, <name>. You need to hear what we've been through.The whole damned Alliance needs to hear what we've been through. There may not be much time left."
4694,"The More You Know : This whole area is littered with Zandalari artifacts. I would be lying if I said studying them didn't interest me. I am fascinated by the significance of these objects to their rituals.The more we understand our enemies, the better prepared we are to defeat them.If I am to study them, I will need to see them up close. Bring me as many artifacts as you can find."
4695,
4696,"Pitching In : The yaungol's siege weapons - those ballista spearthrowers down there - are tearing apart our defenses both at Longying Oupost and in Kun-Lai Summit.Those terrible weapons must be destroyed.Take these explosives. I've covered them in the pitch that you collected.Toss them at those ballistas, and we'll give the yaungol a little taste of their own medicine."
4697,"Gao-Ran Battlefront : With your help, we have quelled the spirits of this place.At last, they may rest in peace.Our journey into this cursed land, I am afraid, has only begun.I have some important matters to finish up here, but we will be moving out soon.I need someone to go ahead and tell Lord Taran Zhu that we are joining him.Find him at the Gao-Ran Battlefront. Tell him what has transpired here."
4698,"Mists' Opportunity : Now is the time to strike.Golgoss, Arconiss, and I will go east, into Jahesh's domain. Meet us there, and prepare for battle.Today, we restore the pride of our people."
4699,"The Meat They'll Eat : I told you earlier, my pigs are picky eaters. They need to eat meat to grow strong, but they don't like mutton, they don't like yak, and I'm not about to feed them any pig meat.They do, however, eat meat off of the mushan beasts, and they're also quite partial to turtle. Both creatures can be found in abundance to the west.My skills as a hunter are admittedly quite weak. Can you help out a young rancher and his pigs?"
4700,"Manipulating the Saurok : I have three magisters entrenched in Ihgaluk Crag, monitoring the saurok and - where they can - turning them against the mogu. I need you to find them and see if they need any supplies or assistance.They will be concealed from view. Look for shimmering columns of light within the saurok village."
4701,
4702,"Beating the Odds : At first, the Slitherscale were too frightened to approach the wild serpents.Then, I caught them snatching the eggs under the cover of night.Now, they are slaughtering adults and hatchlings alike!If we do not do something, these gentle creatures will be completely wiped out. Then there won't even be an Order of the Cloud Serpent to join!Go and slay these vile Slitherscales, and then we will talk."
4703,"Feeding Time : <The serpent darts forward and bites your fingers.>Ouch! It seems, without a doubt, that the little beast is hungry. You recall that some meaty-looking turtles can be found on the wild cloud serpent island to the northeast.Perhaps some turtle meat will fill the hatchling's voracious appetite."
4704,
4705,"Gods and Monsters : Dear $p,Is it true that the mogu are really connected to the titans? I find this very hard to believe. But looking over your research, some of the truth about the mogu begins to take shape.If you visit us at the Seat of Knowledge in Vale of Eternal Blossoms we can add this contribution to your personal collection.Thank you for your diligence!Sincerely,Lorewalker Cho"
4706,"Through the Portal : Ah, just the <class> I wanted to see!We've finally figured out why the portal is not working. We need more arcane powder!It would take us months to get a shipment sent out to us, but luckily, the mogu on this island carry plenty for their own spells.They tend to use some older stuff, so we're going to need a lot of it."
4707,"The Hidden Master : We should be able to handle the defense of Stoneplow from here on out.<The Watch Commander motions towards Lin Tenderpaw.>Lin here is searching for someone she calls ""The Hidden Master"". I believe I know who she's talking about, and I have a clue for you.Go north."
4708,"Minh Do-Tan : Your next challenger is another relatively new trainee. His name is Minh Do-Tan, and he has won his last two matches.He will be waiting for you near the crane statue to the south."
4709,"The Swarm Begins : Without the wall to protect us, we barely stand a chance. If you hadn't gathered so many people to help us, we wouldn't have a prayer.Check in with Captain Oakenshield - he should be up near the break in the wall. Kill as many mantid as you can on the way there.If we win, we win. If we lose, we go down fighting. For Pandaria!"
4710,"Feeding the Beast : I must join the Klaxxi Council and the other paragons immediately, but I am barely strong enough to stand.I must feed, Wakener.I sense the beating hearts of creatures on the northern bank of the lake.Kill them for me, and I shall do the rest."
4711,"Got Silk? : Strange noises comin' from over at the Silken Fields.Strange smells, too.Almost makes you think that they could use a cash-strapped <class> to complete a few odd jobs for 'em. Make a few pieces of gold.Or not."
4712,"Gambling Problem : If this war is to be won we cannot afford to leave anything unchecked, outsider.There is a disturbance along the coast that needs to be investigated. The presence there is not our kind and are of no value to us. However, their supplies could prove very valuable.If there is anything of use there we must get to it before the empress."
4713,"A Strong Back : Some of our trainees have... larger-than normal appetites. We have occasionally had difficulty supplying enough food for all of them. In times like these, we have to ask for help.A kindly older woman, who lives in a small house to the northwest, has agreed to make some stew for our trainees. All you need to do is go and get it."
4714,"Oil Stop : When the yaungols came, they began to dig up oil. What is this ""oil"", I wonder? Perhaps it is thing of much undiscovered luck. This I must know.Here, take this vial, and fill it with yaungol oil from one of their windmills. I will give you many fortunes if you bring me some."
4715,"To Winter's Blossom : The battle against the Sha is eternal - we can not leave this place.   But I am troubled by the absence of reinforcements from the Monastery given that we sent for them days ago.   You have performed admirably, perhaps you could travel to Winter's Blossom, our base camp on the way to the Shado-Pan Monastery. Speak with Lin Silentstrike once you arrive - he should know what is happening. To get there, travel north of the village and follow the road through Shado-Li Basin to Winter's Blossom."
4716,"The Darnassus Mission : The Divine Bell is in the city. We don't want to cause a scene, we just want the artifact. I need you to find a way in, WITHOUT getting caught. That means no mounts, no flying, no fighting.I can provide aid. I will magically cloak you, so you may move with stealth. I will also give you a small charm that you may use to return to safety, should you get in trouble.Now go, <name>. Go, locate the bell, and tag it to be teleported back with you."
4717,"The Kirin Tor : $p, King Varian has asked that I send you after his son to Dalaran. He believes you can help negotiate the withdrawal of blood elves there.These ""Sunreavers"" claim fealty to the Horde and represent a major threat to the war effort.Now that our very own Jaina Proudmoore is in charge of the Kirin Tor it should be easy to convince her to remove this Horde threat to her city.Use the portal here in Lion's Landing to go to the Purple Parlor and lend what aid you can to Prince Anduin."
4718,"A Return to Krasarang : Wherever your loyalties might lie - with Rommath and I, with Garrosh, or elsewhere - one thing is true: your acts today were truly heroic.I can arrange for your transport back to Krasarang Wilds. Speak with me if you would like passage back to Pandaria, <name>."
4719,"If These Stones Could Speak : This is a very ancient place, traveler.Only recently have I pieced together a method of translating the forgotten language carved into these stones.Oh, the thrill of discovery! This never gets old, I assure you.Here, you are the guest. You do the honors. I insist.Use this key to unlock the secrets the stones contain."
4720,
4721,"Assault Deadtalker's Plateau : We have always left the Deadtalkers alone. For so long, they were just responsible for maintaining the sacred burial grounds of the yaungol tribes.  Now, though, they are practicing dark magic, defiling the corpses of their former clanmates...   I know not where they learned those dark magics, or why they no longer treat their dead with respect, but we do not have time to find out.   We need to stop them."
4722,"Holed Up : I can't believe you made it here!  I don't know how much longer I could have stayed hidden in here.I'm sure that there are others. <class>, we have to rescue them! Then we can go to Shado-Pan Fallback. The master there will know what to do!"
4723,"A Gift For Ella : That poor Ella. She's so shy! I saw her standing in the Halfhill Market, looking really hungry, but afraid to talk to any of the chefs.We should bring her some food! And not any boring food - something special.The Kunzen hozen make spicy shrimp dumplings from ingredients they've stolen from our farms. I don't like spicy food, but Ella might!"
4724,"The Scouts Return : Hey, while you were out our scouts came back. And get this, they found some Alliance kid.You should probably go debrief them."
4725,"Jaded Heart : The more powerful remnants of that horrible manifestation may be too much for you to handle on your own, <name>.I fear I'd be of little help in terms of actual combat, but I can suggest a solution.The great jade statue was soon to become a living serpent - one of our revered celestials. Its construction imbued it with special powers that may sufficiently weaken these adversaries."
4726,"Priorities! : Those ""orc"" things ransacked the brewery and made off with my family's finest barrels of cider.I know there is a war out there, but I am not a brewer who will stand idly by while his prized vintage is chugged by undeserving lips.The ""Horde"" will likely put up some resistance. Why don't you put that weapon to good use and help me recover my cider?"
4727,"All of the Arrows : As soon as their reinforcements arrive, the yaungol are going to overrun our position here. If they do that, the village will be lost.Would you be willing to retrieve as many arrows off the battlefield as you can carry? I have a plan that just might save us with your help."
4728,"Direhorn or Devilsaur : We have an opportunity to disrupt the Zandalari war machine as well as have a little fun in the process.Within these beast pens, a devilsaur and a direhorn are being outfitted with armor, their minds being enslaved to the Zandalari charms.Go into the camp and disrupt one of these binding rituals. It doesn't matter which one. Just kill those who are trying to bind the creature. This should let the fully armored beast run mad through the Zandalari camp. Then sit back and watch the hilarity ensue."
4729,"Robbing Robbers of Robbers : Ah, a <class>. I could make good use of your skills.A convoy was struck just up the road by a band of marauding saurok. These marauders made off with some... merchandise... her ladyship, the Madam Goya, had a mind to sell.One does not steal from her ladyship.If you recover these items I will gladly provide you a finders fee."
4730,"Trouble on the Farmstead : I... I escaped from Farmer Chow's, to the southeast of here. It's been taken over by yaungol, but the old man and his wife just won't give it up!  Please, go there and help him out. Maybe if you do, he'll be willing to send some folks back here and help you guys farm up some food for the new town?"
4731,"The Silkwood Road : West of here is the Silkwood Road. It has fallen into shadow as the spiders there have turned to a more evil and gluttonous path.I would face these villains myself but someone has to defend the noodle shop from... um... dangers and such.Go, hero, and conquer these beasts! Should you succeed perhaps I shall regale you with some of my epic tales of heroism.I'll also pay you."
4732,
4733,"Green-ish Energy : One word: Methane!We're going green. Clean burning, high availability, all natural, and will keep the druids off my back when we get back to our neck of the world.That, and I ran out of blasting powder...So, I need your help, <name>.No, no, I wouldn't ask you to do the dirty work - especially not in front of the general. I'll collect these 'deposits' myself.You gather up some wood for an outhouse - I'm thinking long-term here!"
4734,The Second Riddle: Fellowship : You want to stop the Divine Bell? We need the mallet first.You want the mallet? We need to be friends first.You want to be friends? We need a Metal brew first. You want a Metal brew? You need to go to the Shrine of Fellowship first. You want to go to the Shrine of Fellowship? Great! It's in the Jade Forest southeast of the Tian Monastery.Ring the bell and get the Monkey King some brew while there. Oh... you may have to fight for it.
4735,"Ihgaluk Crag : Archmage Modera has taken over at Ihgaluk Crag, to the southeast, continuing her efforts to turn the Saurok against the Zandalari and mogu.Go to her, and help in any way that you can."
4736,"Jaina's Resolution : For too long, I have toiled to mend fences between Alliance and Horde. Time and time again, I've given the Horde the benefit of the doubt - and time and time again, they stab me in the back.I refuse to be betrayed again! If the Horde intends to use the Kirin Tor as a weapon against the Alliance, then they have no place in Dalaran.Come with me, <name>."
4737,"Emergency Response : Your companions have made themselves at home in our land, and brought with them a dangerous conflict.The full extent of their destruction here we cannot yet know. Already it is... unspeakable.Nevertheless, to forsake your friends out of spite would be against our way. Any that yet live are doubtlessly wounded and in desperate need of care.These fireworks were to celebrate the statue's completion. Use them near your companions to signal Mishi, and she will bear them off to safety."
4738,
4739,"Sonic Disruption : Relying on sonic whispers to manipulate the kunchong was only the most primitive stage of my research, and yet the Empire seems to have adopted the practice wholly. The manipulators of the Shek'zeer are too impatient to form a proper bond with their kunchong.Their laziness will cost them dearly.Strike this tuning fork near the dread kunchong in the clutches - watch as they reel in confusion and lash out at their masters. Use this to your advantage and put them down."
4740,Joining the Fight : Lao-Chin's archers will need these arrows down at the bridge. Can you bring them?
4741,"Ancient Power : Hozen skulls are prized tokens among my village.We use them to perform ceremonial rites, and the older the skull, the more potent its magic.Luckily for us, the hozen are careless, filthy beasts. They leave the skulls of their dead scattered among their huts and campfires.Collect these skulls for me, and I will reward you handsomely."
4742,"Buried Secrets : I am told that the mogu once possessed hundreds of hidden armories full of earth-shattering weapons.When a mogu army prepared for war, they struck fear and terror into the hearts of their enemies.THIS is the knowledge I seek here on Pandaria!I have sent an expedition to study some ruins to the west, but they work as slowly as dim-witted peons!Go speak to Fanlyr Silverthorn, their leader. Tell him that I want to see results immediately."
4743,"Echoes of Thunder : Ah, <name>, we meet again. I have heard some wondrous news.High Chieftain Baine Bloodhoof of the tauren has arrived here on Pandaria.He meets with Warchief Garrosh Hellscream and Regent Lord Lor'themar Theron now, at the Shrine of Two Moons in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.He sent me a strange request - to send him a loyal champion of the Horde, capable of combat... and discretion.I can think of none better to send than you. Speak to Tak-Tak if you seek transport."
4744,"The Death of Me : I have resolved to remove this spear from my side.For this, I require your assistance. Your grasping hands are stronger than mine."
4745,"Twinspire Keep : I do not trust this Horde. They wield foul magic, and their intentions are clearly malevolent. We can no longer stand their presence in Twinspire Keep, so close to Paw'don.I beg you, visitor: thin their numbers before they do something awful to this village."
4746,Compy Stomp : The raptors and compies of the Zandalari represent a substantial threat to our forces here. They are superb hunting beasts that can track prey over great distances and are often lethal to encounter when caught unawares.I need you to head into the Beast Pens and cull their numbers. We need to make sure to slay them before they are fully trained.
4747,"Spirits of the Water : Our war against the hozen rages without end, and the future of our tribe is uncertain.This is why our waterspeaker has decided to seek wisdom from the waters.Elder Lusshan is waiting. Please deliver the instruments so that they may begin."
4748,Going on the Offensive : Ha! So my father just wasted twenty years of our lives on a fool's errand!I'm taking charge.When Tyrande sent us here she was very specific that we not come back until we find the source of the Light that she saw in her visions. It's obvious now that the Pools of Youth were not it.I want you to look for my scout. I sent her to investigate the Crane Temple but she hasn't returned.Get her report and rendezvous with us at the Sentinel Basecamp further west.
4749,"Trapped! : <Hao struggles against the rubble with all his might.>HNNNGHHH!!Let me guess: my wife sent you? Imagine that, my delicate little snow lily all worried. Ha ha! She's always frettin' over me. Look--HNNGHH!!!--it'll take more than a little--HNNGGHHH!!--cave-in to keep ol' Hao down.Some o' the boys, on the other hand, are in trouble. Help 'em out if you find any, will ya? I'll be fine.Really."
4750,"The Bees' Knees : You really hozen friend, wikket? Let's see, hmm?Hozen at Grookin' Hill all outta slicky bait. Tigerflies' legs stay twitchy in water - make best bait!Bo Bo sick from stings. Wikket get bait and take to Grookin."
4751,The Greatest Prank : So riddles three you answered me. Good good. The Monkey King is not so old that he tells just anyone his tricks.It was the greatest prank ever!You want to hear story of the Mallet and the Monkey? Too bad! No choice!
4752,"Amber Arms : You! Filth!You work for me now!The amber blades of the Shek'zeer Bladesworn are the finest weapons in the empire.If you are not impaled upon them immediately after leaving here, bring me as many of the blades as you can carry! I want to make sure we have weapons in reserve, should we need them."
4753,
4754,"Sunset Kings : Olon had a clever idea. He thinks that we should visit the sprites to the west, and ask them if they have any of these ingredients. Some of the elements to this recipe are seeming... strange.The Rikkitun sprites have a village to the west of Kor'vess. I hope to see you there, <name>."
4755,"Time Keeper Kairoz : You have found your way to the Timeless Isle, <class>. The bronze dragonflight is keen to investigate the mysteries of this place, but the island is dangerous, and we will need your help.Midway up this beach, you will find a paved path to the east.It will lead you to the ancient Celestial Court. You will find Kairoz there, one of the Keepers of Time that we are working with.Kairoz will answer any questions you might have. Be careful: The way may not be safe."
4756,
4757,"Kor'thik Aggression : I'm no brewer - just looking at all those heaps of ingredients makes my head spin. Just put the brew in front of me when it's finished, thank you.No, I'm here to make sure that the brewers don't get cut in half while they're trying to make that perfect brew. It's not an easy job.The Kor'thik mantid across this basin have been attacking us nightly. If you're already heading over there, why don't you return the favor and attack a few of them?"
4758,"Dust to Dust : The Mawsworn never cease to invent new forms of suffering.  Even the ground on which we tread is formed from souls pounded into dust. With the flood of souls passing through Gorgoa, the Mawsworn are keen to expand their domain.  At present, the Mawsworn are burying souls and crafting new terrain from their torment. It is not too late for some of them.  Free the buried souls and stop the endless expansion of suffering."
4759,"Ogudei's Lieutenants : There are two extremely powerful mogu spirits that the Alliance unearthed in their ineptitude.  These are choice targets for us, <class>. If you kill them and collect each of their essences, we could make great progress on decoding the history of this strange ruin."
4760,"Target of Opportunity: Sra'thik Hivelord : Near the ocean, on the eastern side of Sra'vess, there is a cavern that leads to a network of caves.  From there, the Sra'thik Hivelord maintains Sra'vess and plots against us. If we manage to take him out, we'll disrupt their operations for days.  Let's go to it."
4761,Gardener Fran and the Watering Can : You want me to just GIVE you some hops? Pfshh! This is the third time today some little <race> like you has come up to me asking for food!You want food? Then you'd better work!<She shoves a watering can into your hand.>Now go water my plants!
4762,"A Crocolisk Tale : How could this crocolisk have grown so large?Certainly, rumors exist of very old crocolisks that have grown to enormous sizes... but this female can't be more than a dozen years old.Perhaps someone in New Cifera can shed some light on the subject."
4763,
4764,"Students of Chi-Ji : Our order prides itself on excellence in combat. We hone these combat skills by dueling one another, here on the Cradle of Chi-Ji.Prove yourself in the eyes of the Red Crane. Venture south, into the center of the island, and duel with your fellow students."
4765,"Insertion : <name>! You'll do perfectly.We know where the Alliance have hidden the Divine Bell. We've already inserted an agent into enemy territory, we just need you to help him execute his mission.Pack up, <name>. You're headed to Darnassus."
4766,"Fat Long-Fat : You have been matched with a... special trainee. His name is Fat Long-Fat.<Thelonius chooses his words carefully.>Fat Long-Fat... operates outside of the normal rules of combat. He does not fight every day, and when he does, he chooses his competitor. Today, for some reason... he has selected you.You will find him atop Angkhal Pavilion."
4767,"The Kun-Lai Expedition : I have another message for you from High Chieftain Bloodhoof.It seems you've made quite the impression on him.He travels with the Warchief's vanguard into Kun-Lai Summit, to the north. They have set up an outpost, Garrosh'ar Advance, just east of One Keg.You had best not keep him waiting. Speak to Tak-Tak for swift travel."
4768,"Work Order: Dominance Offensive II : Once your red blossom leeks are ready to be picked, you'll need only to package them for pick-up.Just think; your red blossom leeks will be a part of your faction's efforts in Pandaria!"
4769,"The Trainer's Challenge: Ace Longpaw : You are rising up the ranks of our students, <name>.Just as a sword must be forged through fire, so must our students test themselves against one another.Today, you will spar against one of our brightest disciples, Ace Longpaw. In order to defeat him, you will need to make use of your defensive capabilities.Speak to him in the training ring to begin the challenge. Good luck."
4770,"Hop Hunting : With Li Li fetching grain, and Mudmug handling our water, all we need is hops, and some good wood barrels. I'll handle the barrels... but I need you to gather the hops.I don't know much about the hops from this land, but I'm sure the nearby farmers have something worth brewing with. Go see what you can rustle up."
4771,
4772,"The Bloodletter : I have heard a disturbing report, <class>.Just beyond our position, in the Court of Bones, the mogu bring captives to a general named Kaida the Bloodletter.He thrives on torturing his victims.This monster must be stopped. If you fall to his blade, I wish you a swift death."
4773,
4774,Rest in Peace : The spirits... the cavedwellers... they howl in agony... Trapped... in this world... cannot move... to the next.I... will go mad... listening... to their cries... Please...go...put them to rest.
4775,"A Gift For Fish : That Fish Fellreed is kind of weird. First of all, her name's Fish. That's weird.Once you talk to her, though, she's really a nice lady. Did you know that she's an animal lover?I've got an idea! The Kunzen hozen, in the mountains to the west, make little animal statues and put them in their huts to scare off bad guys. I bet Fish would LOVE something weird like that!"
4776,"The Assault on Shaol'mara : Our scouting efforts along the coast have given us valuable intelligence about the island, <class>.However, we will accomplish nothing if we do not advance forward onto the mainland.I have assembled a team of our most elite aerial units to begin the attack.I would like you to join the assault. A champion such as yourself could turn the battle in our favor at the critical moment.When you are ready to begin the attack, speak to me."
4777,"My Husband... : Lin...  I don't care what Ban, Lao-Chin, or even Taran Zhu says. I'm moving ahead into Townlong. I may not be able to save Lin myself, but I'm not going to sit around waiting for everyone else to catch up.  Once Taran Zhu opens the doors to his precious monastery, we'll save Lin. Until then, I'll scout ahead and make sure he's alright."
4778,"Serpent's Scale : I see you have gained your own hatchling, <race>.Have you been feeding it, cleaning after it, and playing with it properly? Only by doing so will it become strong and healthy.Now let me tell you a trainer's secret. To the north, in The Widow's Wail, you can find a mushroom known as Serpent's Scale.It is difficult to acquire, but this mushroom has powerful properties and important nutrients. Your serpent won't like eating it, but who likes eating their vegetables?"
4779,"Golgoss : The leader of the yaungol mist-shaman is named Jahesh. He is known for his strength.One of my kind is also known for his strength. His name is Golgoss.Golgoss sleeps within the mists of the Upper Sumprushes. Help me to summon him, and he will join me in avenging our people."
4780,"Not Fit to Swarm : Newly hatched mantid have only two instincts: kill and feed. They turn on one another, devouring the weak and leaving the strongest to mature.Those hatched during a swarm - the swarmborn - are turned loose on our enemies instead.The swarmborn in the Clutches of Shek'zeer have been tainted. They are born into shadows and nightmares. Driven by terror, not hunger.They are not fit to swarm. They must be purged."
4781,"A Not So Friendly Request : Scouts have reported a non-mantid presence near Kor'vess. Their intrusion and their theft of amber would normally be dealt with swiftly, but our forces are needed elsewhere.This task seems suited to you, Wakener. You will convince them to leave this land, or you will destroy them in the name of the Klaxxi'va."
4782,The Mantid Threat : The mantid have been corrupting their kypari trees to imbue their amber with power from N'Zoth. The swarm is enough of a menace on its own. N'Zoth could transform them into something even more dire.  The Shado-Pan need to hear about this. I suggest you bring this information to your other allies as well.
4783,"A Fair Trade : <The roar bellows out again, louder and more fierce than any of the yetis you've encountered so far. Again, a grummle voice replies...>Eep! Please, great Kota Kon, forgive grummle. Let me go, I'll bring lots of kafa right away! Promise!<The beast called Kota Kon answers with another meaty roar.>"
4784,"Shrine of the Dawn : The ""children"" you seek are not actually children but grown pandaren, despite what their elders might claim. Their love will not be held in check by the feuds of their families.You will find both Syra and Lo at the Shrine of the Dawn, ever seeking an answer to their dilemma amongst the pandriarchs of old."
4785,He's In Deep : Agent Connelly has managed to infiltrate Garrosh's camp in Kun-Lai! He's been following their every move.Connelly requested you specifically to assist him in gathering some vital intelligence.He sent along a disguise for you. Make sure you put it on before approaching the camp! It will no doubt be heavily guarded.He insists you will know him when you see him. Something about your keen eye for details...Go talk to Fennie over there for a drop-off.
4786,"Stay a While, and Listen : Rush rush rush - are your people always in such a hurry?Sit and have some tea with me a moment, and we will discuss your plight.<Lorewalker Cho's features settle into a patient smile.>"
4787,"Good Luck, Have Fun : I've got some customers lined up that wanna collect some good old fashioned ears. But not any old ears. They only want the absolute waxiest ears money can buy!   Guess they think they're lucky or something'.  Anyways, I need you to go get 'em for me. I don't want to hurt any animals, so you'll need to get 'em from the Alliance over at Lion's Landing.  Have fun - and remember, only bring me the waxiest!"
4788,"Mistblade Destruction : Korven has told me of his findings. There is an enormous amber deposit sitting at the bottom of the Lake of Stars.Unfortunately, a hostile saurok tribe lives at the edge of the lake, and revere the amber as their own.They will not allow us to enter their territory easily.Go south to the lake. Kill the Mistblade saurok, so that we can more easily harvest the nearby amber."
4789,"Devastation Below : Let's get down there and finish that big bug off, you and I."
4790,"One Traveler's Misfortune : Did you have to throw our supplies at them?! Why not use your weapon? Maybe fancy spells or kicks? Why the supplies?!Now we don't have enough to last us, especially with Nephew Bentnail here. His appetite is like a yeti's!You threw it, you get us more. There is wreckage down the path. Maybe you will find supplies there."
4791,Anduin's Decision : You have done all you can for the Prince's friends.You completed your mission and found the White Pawn - Prince Anduin. Admiral Taylor and the other SI:7 agents will be eager to have the boy safe in their custody.It is time to return home.
4792,"A Funeral : As I said, I will gather the town - we will be at the funeral.   As the one who has done so much to honor our friends, we feel it is only right that you will be the one to light the Incense of Life and usher their spirits to the life beyond."
4793,"Egg Collection : Ahhh, I should have known! You have the look of a hungry initiate.I would gladly help you choose a serpent egg, but the Slitherscale have thoroughly raided the cloud serpent nests.I'm terribly sorry. I don't know what to tell you.Unless you're crazy enough to sneak into the saurok camp to the east and retrieve some stolen cloud serpent eggs, I'm afraid I can't help you."
4794,"Prophet Khar'zul : Prophet Khar'zul is a powerful caster, but he is also underestimating your abilities.Khar'zul and his forces must be destroyed to protect this village. His death will send a strong message to the Thunder King that we will not be defeated!You'll find him on the Isle of Reckoning."
4795,
4796,"They Call Him... Stormstout : Things were not always like this, <race>. Oh no, they were much, much worse. Not three weeks ago, we were under siege by saurok bandits. They stole our jade, befouled our food stores, and terrorized our cubs.We needed a hero, and a hero arrived.He drove back their forces, defeated their leader, and returned our stolen jade. All he asked in return was a serpent ride for his niece.I was never able to thank him. If you are headed to the Valley of the Four Winds, would you relay our thanks?"
4797,"Beastmaster's Hunt: The Tiger : Along with the trap, you get some advice on tiger hunting:Tigers are gluttonous creatures, and large game is hard to come by in this jungle. If you wish to tempt the most elder cats out of their hiding places, you may do so with a meal.Just on the other side of the Serpent's Spine, you will find a herd of yaks. Slay them, bring their meat to the jungle's edge, set up your trap, and wait."
4798,"Between a Saurok and a Hard Place : Dear $p,We have received your research on the saurok and believe we have pieced together clues about their past.If you visit us at the Seat of Knowledge in Vale of Eternal Blossoms we can add this contribution to your personal collection.Thank you for your diligence!Sincerely,Lorewalker Cho"
4799,"Bottletoads : Have you heard about the crisis we're having at the pools?Toads have moved in and are spawning like crazy! It's become a real problem for the lotus farmers.Coincidentally, I make a jam out of gelatinous toadspawn. I call it ""Bottletoads"" and it's a big hit with the kids around here. Can't keep any in stock.If you're heading to the pools, you'd be doing everyone a favor by uh... liberating some of those toad eggs.Into this bottle. For me.Just look for bubbles and scoop right in!"
4800,
4801,
4802,Legacy : I'd say we've earned our reward. I can't wait to taste what Mudmug's been brewing.
4803,"The Shado-Pan Offensive : We Shado-Pan have amassed our forces for the first time in many ages.The Sha of Hatred has escaped beyond the Serpent's Spine, and it is our sacred duty to imprison it once more.However, our warriors are great, but our numbers too few. Help from a capable <class> may not be turned away.If you wish to join the offensive, speak to Taran Zhu in the Townlong Steppes."
4804,"A Humble Offering : I'm almost ready for the ritual, there's just one more thing we need: An offering.Relax, I don't mean a sacrifice. Just a bit of food.There are sure to be mushrooms growing in Tideview Thicket to the northwest that are suitable for this. Please bring some."
4805,"Keep It Secret : The Zandalari here are a threat to our campaign, <class>.Their use of magic is an abomination. They mix the power of arcane with the darkness of shadow with little care to consequence.We cannot afford for them to find their full strength here or for the Horde to learn of their twisted magic.Their numbers must be thinned. I will leave this task to you."
4806,The Harmonic Mallet : $p! Prince Anduin has somehow slipped his guards again. His control over the light is greatly increasing.He was last seen heading to Kun-Lai Summit. He gave our mages the slip around the Valley of Emperors.Can you find him? He insists on searching for what he claims is a counter to the Divine Bell. Perhaps you can talk some sense into him before he seizes control of your mind and has you dance your way back here.Talk to Fennie for a ride into the mountains.
4807,"The Gratitude of Stoneplow : One last thing, <name>. Don't worry, it's not another favor. You've killed enough mantid today.We recently received a shipment of high-quality armor from Kun-Lai Summit. I was planning to keep them for my men... but I can't think of anybody more deserving than you. You'll find them on the second floor of the inn, here in town."
4808,"Work Order: The August Celestials II : Once your striped melons are ready to be picked, you'll need only to package them for pick-up.A trainee from the Cradle of Chi-Ji will be along shortly to collect their order."
4809,"The Restless Watch : I'm being told that our scouts have been on duty in Shallowstep Pass for more than 2 days straight, no rest. No wonder mantid are slipping through. Even the most dedicated scouts would slip with those kinds of shifts.I want you to go out there and deliver orders to the scouts that they are to return to the battlefront immediately for rest and rations. I'll arrange for a new shift to be posted."
4810,Cutting the Swarm : The mantid numbers have been increasing since you left for the cleft. Let's put these orbs you gathered to use.Get down on the battlefront and man one of the cannons. Let none through.
4811,"You're Either With Us Or... : The assistance of the nearby village has now become a necessity, $p.We will need to use the village to regroup and tend to our wounded.Perhaps the villagers will join our cause after seeing the brutality unleashed by the alliance.You will act as envoy for the Horde. Ensure the cooperation of their leader. Do not disappoint me!"
4812,"Thieves to the Core : You and that Chen fellow are good people, helpin' out with the virmen like you are. I don't like to ask for favors, but I ain't gonna turn 'em away, either.While you're out there puttin' the hurt to those rabbit-men, you wouldn't mind keepin' an eye out for some bags o' hops, would ya? I'm pretty sure they lifted 'em last night.Probably usin' em for pillows, knowin' how they are."
4813,"Stashed Supplies : The invading mantid have been making off with the Golden Lotus' supplies lately. They're probably hoping  they can starve us out.  Well, they may be right if we can't get some of our supplies back.   While you're taking the fight to the swarm, keep an eye out for anywhere they might have stashed our supplies. You'd be doing the Golden Lotus a big favor if you could recover some."
4814,"A Line Unbroken : When we regrouped after their initial attack, we numbered three less. You can fight, and we must plan our defense should these cursed yaungol attack again.   If you would help us, grant our fallen comrades their last rites, and recover their armor. You will find their bodies to the west, near the gate.  And try to keep the birds off them."
4815,"An End to Everything : These spirits must have been released when the tombs were opened... Death was not final for the Mogu. Instead, death was merely a stop over on the path to a new body. Spiritbinders used a foul magic to transfer spirits from one shell to the next.Years of being trapped in the tombs has left them confused. They need to be destroyed before their confusion turns to anger or worse, they find a new shell."
4816,"Kuo-Na Quillpaw : Most of the duels within the Cradle take place between two trainees. Rarely, when a trainee exhibits a rare amount of skill, they will have an opportunity to duel their trainer.Today, you duel against Kuo-Na. She will be waiting for you at the Pedestal of Hope."
4817,"Mindel Sunspeaker : Our highest-ranked trainee is an outsider like you. It is both strange and exciting to live in a time when so many foreigners have embraced the way of the Crane.Your challenger's name is Mindel Sunspeaker, and he awaits you within Angkhal Pavilion."
4818,"A Gathering Storm : If General Nazgrim sent you, then I trust you are capable of discretion.When I arrived here, I found Garrosh... experimenting... with some ancient power that he found in the mountains to the north.He believes that this ""sha"" can strengthen our soldiers.Unfortunately, so far the results have been quite the opposite.Our troops are erupting into random violence. Go and interrogate them. If they threaten you, be prepared to defend yourself."
4819,"The Fall of Shan Bu : Long ago, Lei Shen found a rare clutch of storm dragon eggs. One of these creatures - Nalak - was particularly brutal, and Lei Shen took it for his own.  The Thunder King's servant, Shan Bu, works to resurrect Lei Shen's dragon, Nalak.  We must defeat Shan Bu and, if we are able, prevent him from resurrecting the dragon."
4820,"The Ruins of Korune : It's time for our boldest move yet, <name>.Since you acquired intel on the location of the Divine Bell, we've amassed a top team to excavate the artifact without delay.Commander Sarannha Skyglaive leads the expedition into the northern-most reaches of Kun-Lai Summit.Join them at once, and use whatever skills you need to make the endeavor a success.Good luck, <class>. I don't need to tell you how important this mission is to the Alliance.Speak to Fennie. She'll get you there quickly."
4821,"In the Wrong Hands : Look... um... this is really embarrassing. I set down my sword for like ONE SECOND to gather some orbs, and a big sprite sprung out of nowhere, snatched it, and bounded off down the western gap.I can't go back to camp without it. Losing your weapon is a sure way to get kicked out of the Shado-Pan. It's sacred.Please, can you try to find this big sprite and get my sword back? It would mean a lot to me."
4822,"Riding the Storm : Shan Bu, the leader of the Shan'ze, is performing some kind of dark ritual at the summit of the island to the northwest.We believe that the subjugated Shan'ze Cloudrunners are powering the spell. How, we still do not know.We believe that the Shan'ze Cloudrunners can still be saved from the corruption that taints them.Take these bronze claws. Use them to mount the back of a Shan'ze Cloudrunner.Attack them. Beat some sense back into their heads!"
4823,"Maul Gormal : Thanks to you, there's a small militia of farmers hiding nearby. Hanae said something about giving them ""liquid courage"" which, I'm pretty sure, means they're sauced and ANGRY.The mogu think they can walk all over us - we'll give them a fight that will open their eyes.Follow the trail through the ruins and down to the beach. Find their leader. When you engage him, we'll be there to back you up."
4824,"Yakity Yak : For now, the yaungol invaders seem content to steal yaks. Surveying the area, however, you notice they could easily move on the Yak Wash at any moment.Thinning their numbers may help show the yaungol that this area is protected."
4825,"You Have to Burn the Ropes : I, umm... well...Oh, never mind. It was a stupid idea.It's just that, I was thinking that maybe we can stop the Kunzen hozen from attacking us without having to, you know... KILL anything. I noticed a few ropes on the side of the mountain. I think they're using them to climb down to our farms and...No, forget it. It was a silly idea anyways."
4826,"The Call of Thunder : Within the graveyard, in the deepest ruins of their western crypt, the Thunder King's most powerful sorcerers are charging a lightning rod with crackling electricity.We suspect that this weapon is meant to rain destruction on our stronghold at Violet Rise.There is no time to delay. You must stop their ritual at once."
4827,"Surgical Strike : Zandalari spiritbinders perform sacrifices to their gods, the beastcallers bend innocent skyscreamers to their will, and the jaguar warriors venture closer to us by the day.  Dispose of these threats in Za'Tual, <race>, and watch the might of the trolls weaken."
4828,"Beyond the Horizon : I recognize all you've managed to do here, <class>. My report to the Warchief will include an account of your deeds.But there's no time to rest!This land must be charted and prepared for Horde settlement. I've already selected an away team to do just that.Find them before they grow comfortable here. Inform them of their mission, and try to convince your new friends to send along one of their own to serve as a guide.You'll be staying here with me. We have preparations to make."
4829,"Chasing Hope : Chi-Ji is always with us. Even when he is not here in the Cradle, pieces of his spirit run through the forests and beaches of the island, watching us and testing us.Prove your dexterity in the eyes of Chi-Ji, <name>. Find and catch the spirits of the crane."
4830,"On Her Magic-ey Secret Service : Under orders from Jaina herself, some of our agents attempted to sneak past mogu lines to find out what was going on in the mines.  They were captured, and are being subjected to who-knows-what kind of awful tortures.  You must free them and kill whoever captured them. We don't leave anyone behind!"
4831,"The First Riddle: Mercy : So, you wake up the Monkey King for a mallet hmmm? Answer first, these riddles three, and then the mallet you shall see.First riddle!  ""Softly singing a song of pain    There is a creature tortured and lame.    Way down south and beyond the wall,    It hides from its wikket masters' call.    Seek out the creature sad and somber,    And free it from its untamed amber.""Bring me the untamed amber."
4832,"Round 2: Kang Bramblestaff : Your next challenger is a Bramblestaff. Strength is in their blood. I remember a full century of only Bramblestaff champions.No pressure, little <race>.Go to the eastern arena north of here and face this young challenger. See first hand if strength is earned or inherited."
4833,Wakening Sickness : You will forgive my current state. I have slept for many years.A Klaxxi'va should have been here to attend my Wakening with kypari sap... but you will have to do.I sense the buzzing of sapflies to the south. They gorge on the nourishing sap I need. Bring them to me.
4834,"A Tangled Web : We have had a disturbing report from the Anglers fishermen of Sri-La Village, <name>.Many of their villagers are missing, taken by the spiders who live in The Widow's Wail, a cave along the coast to the north.The victims are dragged into the dark depths, wrapped in cocoons, and left to become the spiders' next meal.We believe that some of the people may still be alive. There is still time to save them! I need you to go and rescue as many villagers as you can find."
4835,Extracting Answers : Kypari Ik is just one of many locations that houses some of Empress Shek'zeer's offspring. In their juvenile state the young are reckless and difficult to control. They are also deadly.Swarmborn are hatched with a highly toxic venom that diminishes in potency with age. The venom can incapacitate even the strongest and most skilled fighter if it hits flesh.I would like you to bring me some of this venom.
4836,"Wing Clip : The young fliers of this era are fascinating. Their exceptional agility and endurance were, in my time, the feats of incredibly skilled or mature fliers.This would seem to indicate some kind of evolution in wing structure... Or perhaps a result of advancements in training? Induced genetic mutation? Selective breeding?Gah! There's no way to know for certain without tissue samples.Bring me their wings! And try not to ruin them in the process, will you? I need them intact!"
4837,The Zan'thik Dig : We have just intercepted a message from an adjunct on Zan'vess. Yaungol laborers there have unearthed a paragon in the amber quarry on the back side of the island.Get there immediately and free him before the Zan'thik destroy him!
4838,"Taking Stock : I was dispatched back to camp to gather pitch-tipped arrows for our archers at the bridge, and this is what I came to. I trained with most of these pandaren... I wasn't prepared for this.Still, the archers at the bridge need our help. If you could help gather arrows from the wreckage, then maybe we can salvage something from this horror."
4839,"Sra'vess Wetwork : The mantid outnumber us quite badly. Hundreds of them for each of us.  And, they surround us on two sides - at Gao-Ran in the south we're holding them off, but to the west, on the island they call Sra'vess, they continue to mass unabated.  We're not stupid. We're not going to launch a full scale attack on them. We can't sustain an intense battle on multiple fronts.  Instead, we're going to send you, and one of our Wu Kao, to do some dirty work. Sounds fun, doesn't it?"
4840,"The Missing Admiral : Alright. According to the clues you found, that was Anduin's ship, and Admiral Taylor was the captain.   And Admiral Taylor's last entry says he was going to fight off the hozen and protect the vessel after the shipwreck.  The locals say these hozen sometimes take prisoners, and I didn't see Taylor's corpse anywhere among the wreckage. So you'll probably find Taylor at the hozen encampment to the northeast.  Get going, we have no time to lose!"
4841,"Farmhand Freedom : Those Ordo yaungol are working my farmhands to death! It just ain't right.Please, <class>, save them before it's too late."
4842,"The Murksweats : Take a good look. The river nearby is swarming with these snakes. Their venom causes a condition the locals call ""the murksweats.""Several refugees were bitten as they fled the temple and have already begun to show symptoms: nausea, vomiting, and intense sweating as the body rejects all fluids, causing dehydration and potentially death.We are administering anti-venom as quickly as possible, but we'll need more venom glands. Don't bother removing the glands yourself - just bring back the whole head."
4843,"A Terrible Sacrifice : I have an idea, and... am prepared to make a terrible sacrifice.  As much as I know that we need my stout brew, to fortify our defenders for the long-term security of the Ox Gate...  It is too painful to discuss details now, but please - while you are up here defending the wall, gather the barrels of oil they are using to light their arrows. We will need them."
4844,"Burning Down the House : Look, <name>!These Alliance dogs built a camp up on the ridge.Here, take my grog. Let's make a fire they can see from Stormwind!For the Horde!"
4845,"The Rider's Bind : Have you seen the young serpents in the training yard?The littles ones tend to be mischievous, and some of them ran off to play before the training session.The Mistress will get angry if she discovers they're missing.Would you go find them and bring them back to me? I don't want them to get into trouble.They like to play out in the open, so look for them in courtyards and around the spires."
4846,"Memory Wine : <The radio static crackles, and Agent Connelly continues speaking.>Now comes the real challenge, <laddie/lassie>. Head on over to the center of camp and see what you can overhear."
4847,"Round 4: Master Windfur : Well done, challenger. You have reached the final round.Your last opponent is a powerful master of the winds. He has defended his people for many years and stood as champion on more than one occasion.Face this Master Windfur in the main arena when you are ready.And challenger... good luck."
4848,"The Easiest Way To A Serpent's Heart : <The hatchling scowls at you.>Uh-oh, looks like someone is in a bad mood today!Luckily, you know just the thing that will cheer up the little beast.Cloud serpents love the taste of tiger meat, but the tender flanks can be... challenging... to acquire.Luckily, you recall there are some fat, juicy tigers to the northwest, on Windward Isle.Sure, you might suffer some scratches and a little mauling, but it's all worth it for your serpent, right?"
4849,"On The Prowl : I have heard report of a great white beast that stalks the wood on the northwestern side of the wild serpent island.This savage creature is mate to the Windward Huntress, and already he has taken down several of the adult cloud serpent matriarchs.We cannot have such a fearsome predator roaming the island unchecked.Go and deal with this creature. Let us see if your training has paid off."
4850,"The Kunchong Whisperer : To really connect with Kovok you need to challenge him mentally and physically. You must respect his strength and intelligence; only then will he allow you to really train him.The muckscale tribe may provide an adequate test of his abilities and with you there he shouldn't be in danger.Additionally, this will allow us to decrease their numbers in the Briny Muck."
4851,"In Skilled Hands : <name>, take these crossbow bolts and then bring them to Hawkmaster Nurong at Farwatch Overlook to the southwest.Nurong is praised among all the Wukao for being a flawless shot. His efforts are credited with holding the line here for these many months. I'm hoping you can work with him and judge for yourself. He may be the final Shado-Pan we need for the hunt."
4852,"Pristine Banner of the Mantid Empire : This artifact has been restored to a remarkably excellent condition.  Perhaps you will put it on display at the Seat of Knowledge, so that lorewalkers and archaeologists can study it."
4853,"Marshals of Madness : The n'raqi have long served as the commanders and taskmasters of the Old Gods' forces. Their presence on the field of battle shows that this invasion is a coordinated effort rather than a random outbreak of corruption.  Led by these faceless masters, the chaotic forces of the Old Gods transform into capable military.  We must make it a priority to fell these creatures. Only then might we take the upper hand against N'Zoth."
4854,"An Air of Worry : My sight has long since faded, but when the wind is right I can still smell the blossoms of Nectarbreeze Orchard as if they were in my own palm.Today, though, their fragrance is muddled with smoke. Please, if you are able, check in on the orchard and see that things are okay. Perhaps my old nose is playing tricks on me.You'll find the orchard to the southwest, beyond the statue of the Jade Serpent."
4855,"Spitfire : We've tended these orchards and made cider from their nectar for generations. In that time, we've learned a special trick for putting out fires in a pinch.<Hanae pushes a jug of cider into your hand.>The cider itself - when mixed with crushed gingerleaf and saliva - quickly becomes sticky and viscous. Perfect for smothering flames.Please, while you're out there, try to get the flames under control. I've already mixed in the gingerleaf, just swig and spit."
4856,"The Conquest of Stone : In the Court of Bones, the Thunder King's sorcerers perform dark rituals.To bolster their numbers, the Shan'ze soulrippers are imbuing ancient stone statues with stolen spirits from the living.After these stone conquerors are brought to life, they will be formidable opponents on the battlefield.We must stop their ritual before these statues can be revived."
4857,"Warn Stoneplow : So much death. And more to come, if Ambassador Han's stories of the mantid are to be believed.We must help. We must do our part to save lives.Travel to Stoneplow. Warn them of the coming mantid attack.I will join you with what forces I can muster once I have laid Kor's body to rest."
4858,"Hue : The most distinguishing feature of the Dream Brew is its iridescent, dream-like color.To the east, you will find Glittering Amberflies. I will need their wings to create the final luminescent color of the brew.Take this knife and use it to collect 8 wings."
4859,"The Korune : These terracotta wardens are fearsome, but not nearly as horrifying as the creature that we found at the top of the ruins.Some of our surviving scouts reported seeing some kind of mogu spellweaver on the highest rise to the north.He practices a type of magic unlike any other we have seen.We must learn whatever we can from this creature. Slay him, and bring me anything you find."
4860,"Ellia Ravenmane: Revenge : Your ""rival"" has appeared again. Ellia Ravenmane has been avoiding her duties on the island, instead focusing on personal training, with the intent to defeat you in battle.""I will destroy <name>,"" she said.I have honored her request for a rematch, but I will be keeping a close eye on her. Her motives may be shifting in a dangerous direction."
4861,"Back to Eastwind Rest : Well, far as I figure, we've got quite a lot of rebuildin' to do.  I'm not one for joining any big causes, but my farmhands aren't gonna have much to do 'round here, to be honest. And, since you helped them out, they want to join your ""Horde"". So, who am I to stop 'em?  Bring 'em with you, back to Farmhand Ko. I'll miss 'em, but they're better off with you."
4862,"Setting the Trap : Take these 3 ritual stones to the location I have marked on your map. There, you will find a Shan'ze ritual object that you can use to beckon one of their powerful allies.You will need capable friends at your side for this trap to work. Do not go alone, for these will be some of the Thunder King's most powerful servants.When your enemy shows itself, show no mercy."
4863,"The Silver Covenant's Stronghold : I have it on good authority that Archmage Aethas Sunreaver is being held in the Silver Enclave, home of the Silver Covenant. Arcanist Rathaella holds him in captivity.Most Covenant agents are out slaughtering Sunreavers right now, which means our chance is ripe. Slay Rathaella, and spring Aethas from his prison."
4864,"Za'Tual : The Zandalari have been a constant nuisance since we arrived on this island. I've assigned Archmage Lan'dalock to take charge of dismantling their presence at Za'Tual, in the south.Report to him when you are best able. He will have work for you."
4865,
4866,Taoshi and Korvexxis : Taoshi is setting up an ambush for one of the mantid leaders on the south side of Sik'vess. She is tasked with retrieving his crystal so that we can use it to open the door.Two are stronger than one. I want you there to make sure it goes smoothly.
4867,"Into the Crypts : Every day, we uncover additional relics from the Court of Bones.Recently, we discovered this scroll amongst the gravestones in one of the deepest crypts.I believe that this incantation can be used to call beyond the grave. And if my Mogu is up to date, I'd say you should use it in the last room in the Hall of the Exalted.Would you be willing to test out my theory?"
4868,"Mogu?! Oh No-gu! : I know your friends are worried about the animating statues over at Mogujia, but I'll tell you what you should really be worried about.  Where there are animated statues, there are Mogu. I don't know if you've seen one before, but if you haven't...  Well, let's just say Mogu are bad, bad, news.  While you're dealing with whatever else you're doing, you need to get the Mogu behind the trouble!"
4869,"Centuries in Sentries : Sacrifices are common place in Zandalari society. There is however one oddity among these barbaric rituals; volunteers. They treat it as a great honor!The weak still seek to contribute, even if that means giving their lives to be bound to the sentries you see walking around. Locked away in service to their people.Take this resonating crystal. Once destroyed, drain the sentry of its Zandalari inhabitant. Return the crystal to me when your task is complete."
4870,"The Source of Korune Power : Why hullo there! Have ya ever seen tha like o' these statues? Fascinatin'!I was scouting up along the ruins earlier, and I spotted somethin' innerestin' up on the highest rise.I couldn't get close enough, but I think it might be one o' these mogu statues, 'cept it was movin'!I can't get through all those nasty blood elves, but you look like you could.Would you mind going up there and bringing me back anything of interest?"
4871,"Gourmet Kafa : It was genius: kafa berries go in the goot, seeds come out.Kafa'kota is already rare and worth a fortune, but my invention--Kafa'goot--is GOURMET.But it's over now. Uncle is upset and peak is a muss. All that's left is to collect the rest of the Kafa'goot and never make it again.I won't ask you to gather it--kind of a mussy task, not fit for hero-- just mark it so I can find it easily when the mountain is safe again."
4872,Gifts of the Great Crane : The cranes of Krasarang are a gift from Chi-Ji. Even the very feathers they leave behind are a gift for us to appreciate.We use these feathers to adorn our garments and to fletch arrows. But first... they must be gathered.
4873,"Ellia Ravenmane: Rematch : Ellia Ravenmane requested a rematch with you. She seems to identify you as her ""rival"".We discourage rivalries here within the Cradle of Chi-Ji, but we rarely decline a rematch request. You will find Ellia near the Pedestal of Hope, on the island's eastern side."
4874,"Ellia Ravenmane: Redemption : Ellia Ravenmane, your rival, has returned. She demands that you meet her atop the Pedestal of Hope.You need to understand, <name>... something horrible has happened to her. She has changed. You will see for yourself when you arrive at the pedestal.Good luck, <name>."
4875,"What's Yours Is Mine : The elders want us to mount a defense? We're not monks, <class>; we need weapons if we hope to fight!Scavenge some arms from those barbarians for me. I should be able to melt them down and make something more suitable for our villagers to fight with.Bring me as many as you can carry and I'll take care of the rest."
4876,"The Trainer's Challenge: Suchi the Sweet : Today you will face Suchi the Sweet in the training ring. Despite her sweet exterior, she is a tough opponent.She attacks swiftly and surely, but such potent attacks can become tiring over time.If you hope to defeat her, you will need to concentrate your damage when she is weakened.Speak to Suchi to begin the duel. Good luck."
4877,"The Endless Swarm : Gao-ran's men need help down on the southern front. If you want to stand by the Shado-Pan, that's where you should do it."
4878,"The Mogu Menace : Our scouts have discovered a heavy mogu force at Shan'ze Dao to the northwest.The island was supposedly uninhabited, so their presence is disturbing news.Even more disturbing is the fact that they are performing sinister experiments on the island.I need a capable <class> to check out the situation.The Shan'ze are likely to give you trouble, and if they do, kill them."
4879,"Piercing Talons and Slavering Jaws : First the hawks came. You've probably seen some of them circling up above.The wolves came shortly after. I think they smelled my weakness.I'm not nearly as brave as Master Shang thought I was. The master will be quite cross with me if I don't do something about these beasts.Can... can you help, <sir/ma'am>?"
4880,Loa-saur : The Zandalari have found a way to bind loa to their beasts giving them impressive and lethal powers.We need to put a stop to this.Search the Beast Pens for a loa speaker and slay him. You should be able to find them by keeping a look out for their glowing beasts.We must not allow these atrocities to continue.
4881,"Raid Leader Slovan : The raiders are led by a particularly violent saurok known as Slovan. The Crane Temple usually comes to our aid when he attacks but now we find ourselves outmatched and outmaneuvered.Please, <class>, aid us by destroying this raid leader.You can find him in his den behind the Krasari Falls."
4882,"A Zandalari Troll? : While you've been destroying the reanimated mogu statues, the unmistakable accent of a Zandalari troll has been taunting you.It's clear that the threat to Westerly Rest will not end until he's been dealt with."
4883,"Poisoned! : The... mogu. Do not trust. Poison. Get sample... sample blades. Bring to Dezco... in Thunder Cleft, west of here."
4884,The Beast Pens : I do not want to see another Zandalari beast rider breach our defenses!I have dispatched Scout Captain Daelin and some war mages to the Beast Pens northwest of here. Their mission is to infiltrate and harass the Zandalari siege and cavalry units. I want you to join them and lend your expertise.Keep an eye out for the tell tale shimmer of their magical cloaking spell.
4885,"A Gift For Sho : Sho - that girl who lives up in the mountains - is in town today. I saw her walking toward the Halfhill Market.Such a long walk... she must be hungry! And I think I know just the thing that she'll like.The hozen up on the Skyrange cook a soup out of fish and apples. It sounds gross, I know... but it's awesome. You'll find it near their big, scary totem."
4886,"Clearing a Path : First thing's first. If we're going to take the leader captive, we'll need to thin the numbers of his agents.  Be careful. These mogu are particularly dangerous - they appear to be manipulating the sha in ways we haven't seen before."
4887,It Takes A Village : The villagers have been guarding Zouchin since the first attack. They are exhausted and many are injured.If the Zandalari attack again the last thing we need is for the defenders to fall asleep on the job.Relieve them of their posts so that they might have time to heal and see their families.You'll find them stationed around the village.
4888,"Allies in the Shadows : The Shado-Pan arrived here before we did, and they are already at work undermining the Thunder King's forces.I want you to meet with Taran Zhu, the leader of the Shado-Pan, and offer your services on behalf of the Sunreavers. I doubt he is truly in need of the aid, but the gesture holds importance in itself."
4889,"Seeking Fate : I have not been completely forthright with you, despite all that you have done to aid the Timewalkers. I cannot tell you everything, not yet, but know this - there is a traitor amongst us. Tell no one of your mission today, and take caution around any of my flight while you hold the Vision of Time.Quickly now, return to the Siege of Orgrimmar once more and use the hourglass.And be safe."
4890,"Slaying the Scavengers : The rotting corpses are attracting hyena scavengers.In addition to spreading diseases from feeding on the dead, the feral creatures will attack us on sight.Go and eradicate the beasts. It is unfortunate, but ultimately for the best."
4891,Shackles of Manipulation : The Zan'thik employ a sizable force of... indentured labor.Yaungol are bound in special shackles which enhance and prolong the effects of sonic manipulation. It is this technology that allows the Zan'thik manipulators to command such large quantities of thralls to endlessly toil for them in the quarries.I would like to study these shackles.
4892,"Research Project: The Mogu Dynasties : Ah, an explorer. Just what I could use. I am on the verge of discovering the dark secrets of the mogu.Not all of the secrets, mind you. They kept a lot of dark secrets. But I am on the verge of discovering ""a"" secret at least.If, in your travels, you come across some fragments of the mogu past, bring them to me and I will happily reimburse you for them."
4893,"Onyx Hearts : The Shan'ze Serpentbinders dominate the minds of wild cloud serpents, but they also create their own dark creatures from stone, metal, blood, and ancient sorcery.Their creations, the Onyx Stormclaws, guard the island to the northwest.I wish to study the magic binding these creatures. Bring me their hearts, so that I can better understand what sorcery we are up against."
4894,The Moth Rebellion : Oh... oh good! A <class>! Could you help me?I created a strain of vile monsters during my experiments to improve silk output.The result was a full-scale moth rebellion. Can you use your <class>iness and destroy some of these mutants?
4895,"Thinning the Sik'thik : For all our efforts to keep the mantid in the Dread Wastes, some have broken through, seemingly intent on Niuzao Temple. My men have been attempting to extinguish their presence to the west, at Sik'vess, but to no success. If you're half of the <class> Taran paints you to be, maybe you will fare better.Head west, and kill any Sik'thik mantid you find. And remember, this is no time for mercy. There are lives at the temple depending on us."
4896,"The Kunzen Legend-Chief : I've heard people talk about the hozen like they're just some tribe of barely-functional idiots... but that's not true! They have brains, too - they just don't all like to use them that much.I've heard that the Kunzen tribe has two chiefs - one in charge of fighting, and one in charge of stories, lore, and history.What I wouldn't give to see what kind of stories they tell..."
4897,"Preventing a Future Threat : It pains me to think of the torture the poor skyscreamers  must endure as the trolls train them to become implements of war.  The hatchlings are quite fearful, and will fly away if you even get close them. Please, frighten some away before the Zandalari corrupt them."
4898,"Direhorn vs Devilsaur : We have an opportunity to disrupt the Zandalari war machine as well as have a little fun in the process.Within these beast pens, a devilsaur and a direhorn are being outfitted with armor, their minds being enslaved to the Zandalari charms.Go into the camp and disrupt one of these binding rituals. It doesn't matter which one. Just kill those who are trying to bind the creature. This should let the fully armored beast run mad through the Zandalari camp. Then sit back and watch the hilarity ensue."
4899,Zandalari on the Rise : We've spotted a Zandalari leader up the central stairs. We need to eliminate him before returning to camp.Can you handle this one?
4900,"Julia Bates : We welcome all kinds here within the Cradle, as long as they recognize and subscribe to the ideologies of the Red Crane. One of our new, more exotic trainees comes from the human kingdoms to the northeast. She goes by the rather foreign-sounding name of Julia Bates.She is your next challenger. You will find her on the island's western shore."
4901,"Just A Folk Story : What!?! This don't make any sense! <Fish's face falls.>What's this mumber jumber about a maiden and an ancestor and a buncha stairs?I can't make any reason outta this, can you?Well, there are lotsa folks 'round here who're much older than you and me, <name>.Can you go talk to the folks in Halfhill? I betcha they might know somethin'!"
4902,"Enraged By Hatred : These scorpions are infected with sha. It seems to have driven them out of their hole and into our camp, seething with hatred at invaders in their territory.We need to clear the scorpions and secure the camp. Kill any you find."
4903,"The Dreadsworn : The Klaxxi see far and hear much. They have shared their insight with me.The Vor'thik embrace the sha, using its power to fuel their march in this false swarm. Their warriors consume tainted amber and call themselves dreadsworn.There is no future for them. They are waste which needs disposing.And YOU will begin that process for us when you reach Kypari Vor."
4904,"Knocking on the Door : Now, onward to the Stormstout Brewery! It's high time that I was reunited with the rest of the Stormstouts... and what better way to reunite than over a few mugs of ale?You know where the brewery is, right? Just follow this road to the west. You can't miss it. Of course, you're free to share the road with us - we'll be leaving any moment now."
4905,
4906,"Educating Saurok : The Spring Road is under the protection of her ladyship, the esteemed Madam Goya.The saurok of Hatescale Burrow northeast of here require ""education"" in this fact. We have warned them before but sadly they seem to have a very short memory.Travel northeast to this burrow and find their shaman leader. Eliminate him and you will have the gratitude of her ladyship. As well as an appropriate bounty."
4907,"Finding Yi-Mo : My nephew, Yi-Mo, has always been sort of a downer. When this wave of despair hit the town, he took it harder than most. He sat around for days refusing to eat, just staring off into the horizon.Now he's wandered off toward the cliffs northeast of here, where the thunderbirds nest and hunt.Please, <class>, will you look for him?"
4908,"Scouting Report: The Friend of My Enemy : We weren't only looking for Alliance, you know. We were also looking for those snooked-up, tik-flikklin' jinyu!Well, we found 'em all right..."
4909,"The Pearlfin Situation : I've been thinking.We are cut off from support and a long way from home.Although these Pearlfin jinyu mistrust our presence, they do not appear to be hostile.If we could convince them that we are their friends, an alliance between our races could prove extremely valuable.<name>, you must go speak to the jinyu around the village.Convince their leaders that we are not to be feared, and that we only wish for peace."
4910,"Borrowed Brew : A delicious smell wafts out from the bottle on the table.A little taste couldn't hurt, right?"
4911,"An Ancient Legend : My father has dedicated his life to studying the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.The Vale is a mythical place, sealed after the Pandaren revolution twelve thousand years ago. We know so little about it!My father followed a trail of clues to the cave down the hill, seeking a very old poem known as the Song of the Vale, but he is in no condition to retrieve it. It is guarded by some sort of ancestor spirit.If you are heading that way anyway, would you mind bringing it back to him?"
4912,"Maximum Capacitor : The mines north of here are critical to the mogu supply line. They are using giant lightning enchanted drills to extract the ore.  If you can disrupt the drills, they'll be destroyed, greatly slowing their ability to make weapons.  Oh, also, kill whoever is in charge, will you?"
4913,"No Plan Survives Contact with the Enemy : Quickly and quietly; that's how SI:7 prefers to operate. That was the plan, at least.Rell Nightwind is already inside Garrosh'ar Point looking for signs of Anduin and Taylor, but it's getting hot in there and he needs support.Fight yer way through these dogs and find Rell!"
4914,"Mission: Predator of the Cliffs : During my routine patrol of the mountains this morning, I spotted a huge white bird diving down to the farmlands.It lifted an entire yak in its talons and disappeared among the cliffs.Today a yak, tomorrow a farmhand!We must eliminate this bird before it chooses its next victim."
4915,"The Vale of Eternal Blossoms : It's been many lifetimes since the gates to the valley were open, <name>.I wouldn't miss this for the world, and neither should you!Meet me at the southen edge of Kun-Lai Summit. I'll wait for you there."
4916,"Fate of the Stormstouts : $p! It is so great to see you healthy, and traveling so far. It would seem that our paths are quite tightly intertwined.I'm here looking for my family. I am told that several Stormstouts came across the wall to help face the mantid threat. I mean to find them, and join them.Have you seen anyone named Stormstout come through here? Would you mind helping me ask around?"
4917,"Free From Her Clutches : The Shek'zeer manipulators are corralling young kunchong into that clutch and exposing them to raw fear energies, twisting them and accelerating their growth.Disgusting! I will not allow it!Break open the cages and set those hatchlings free."
4918,"Bronze Claws : Among the Shan'ze's fiercest and most loyal creations are their quilen.These beasts will hunt until they kill their prey, or die in the process.I need you to not only cull their numbers, but also to retrieve their bronze claws.Their claws are strong and razor sharp, and we can use them to make weapons and hooks for our cause."
4919,"Defense At Niuzao Temple : Niuzao Temple, far to the west, is under attack by the mantid.The great Celestial holds them back for now, but he cannot stand alone forever.Go and help the defenders, <class>. The Temple must not fall!"
4920,"Fox Mastery : So, when I was scouting east of here I saw a collection of foxes. That's what I first learned to hunt when back on the Wandering Isle.If you want to see the challenge a young pandaren hunter faced when growing up, head east and face off against a bunch of foxes. They tend to be clever and cunning so be on your guard."
4921,"The Arcanic Oubliette : An Alliance member? Here? Elune be praised.My team has encountered a snag. We opened a portal to this land using some ancient scrolls we had found that predated Azshara's rule.Unfortunately, the coordinates provided on the tablets were warded and the portal that meant to take us to our destination landed us in this oubliette.We have been trapped here for days, and it is slowly leaching our energies to power itself.Can you find the nearby shackles that bind the oubliette and disable them?"
4922,"Immortality? : Something is... off. The water feels strange.When we arrived here I felt the presence of the Light, strong and vibrant, far to the north.I thought it would be the Pools of Youth. But this... this water is tainted somehow. Stained with mogu magics.I think it best I try only a sip and we see what happens."
4923,
4924,"Subtle Encouragement : The saurok are vile, but we share an enemy: the mogu. And I'd rather send saurok to kill mogu than send my own men.We've been collecting mogu weaponry. Bury these polearms into the skulls of the saurok. Feed our enemies' rivalry, and you may save Horde lives."
4925,"Citizens of a New Empire : At Shek'zeer's command, the great kypari tree of Kypari Vor was twisted into a totem of horror.Like those outside of the palace, the clutch nearby is now used to corrupt our swarmborn.Recover the eggs of the Vor'thik before they are tainted. We shall raise them here. They will be the citizens of a new empire, free from the sha."
4926,"A Kind of Magic : Greetings $p! I have heard a lot about your success in the field. I would like to use your services to test my latest ""Siege-o-Matic"", a device of terrible and varied abilities.I promise it is mostly harmless to its users.When you are around Domination Point be on the look out for my Scout-o-Meters. They have been dispatched to get info on good siege targets. When you find one, activate it and I will pilot a Siege-o-Matic to your location.See you in the field... as it were."
4927,"Totemic Research : As we entered the village, I couldn't help but notice yaungol totems lying around this camp.I have a suspicion that there are dark forces at work here, and those totems may be the key to drawing them out.Could you bring me some of these totems for further inspection? I would like to study them."
4928,"Trap Setting : Good to meet you, <class>. We have traps all along the pass to help us catch mantid that might be sneaking through, but their numbers have been so great that most of the traps have already been triggered.Taoshi said you might be able to reset some of them while you're out there. Can you help?"
4929,"Ancient Vengeance : I can hear them howling in rage... The spirits of the Gurthani mogu I slew so long ago. They wander this ruined terrace, seeking vengeance.If they find me in this state, I will not have the strength to fend them off. Draw their attention and put them down.Finish what I started, and I will tell you who I am."
4930,Joining the Hunt : We are one stronger. Your help is invaluable.Let's move on westward to Rensai's Watchpost to find the last member for our party.
4931,"Weed War : You want some hops? I've got plenty in the shed out back. I'll gladly share some with you... if you'll help me weed my field.Now ""hop"" to it! Get it?"
4932,Spellbound : Grand Magister Rommath has something in his possession that I want.He brought a very powerful tome with him. It would be better for our cause if it were no longer in Sunreaver hands.Locate Rommath's book of incantations and bring it to me.
4933,"Mushan Mastery : Mushan! Would ya look at the size o' 'em. Old as the dirt they walk on probably. A fine trophy.If you are lookin' to test your mettle as a big game hunter, start with them."
4934,"A Steady Hand : The black walnut extract you purchased from Miss Whiteblossom is but one of many extracts we keep in stock for various applications.Blushleaf extract can be gathered from the flowers in the Waxwood Forest to the west. Several units can be extracted from one flower, but only those with calm nerves and steady hands can remove all of the extract from one flower."
4935,
4936,"Apply Directly to the Forehead : Well... THAT was unexpected!Come to think of it, now Ken-Ken remember why hozen use mask in the first place...A legend about the Monkey King says he used a mask to cure old pandaren emperor, Shaohao, when he was too sad to lead his people. Then they buried mask--with all his sadness--in the ground.We should use the mask on more pandaren, but instead of putting sad away in ground, we gonna PUNCH ITS BUTT.Let's do this, <name>!"
4937,Ashes of the Enemy : The mogu at the Court of Bones are bolstering their army by resurrecting the spirits of their dead.We cannot allow them to revive their fallen warriors.Take this torch and burn any mummified corpses that you can find.We will destroy our enemies before they have a chance to rise.
4938,"Just Some Light Clean-Up Work : This is not a glamorous job. Let me put it to you bluntly.The Skumblade saurok pile all of their filth into a pool in the middle of their village. This filth is so concentrated and so rancid that it has congealed into moving, animate matter.The saurok can keep their filth-pool, but once it starts spreading outside of the village, I'd say it's time to intervene."
4939,"Orders are Orders : Hmm, maybe wikket not so bad after all!Other baldskins not nice to hozen.Hozen take this from bad wikkets!All wikket loot goes to Kah Kah - Chief's orders!Here, wikket. You take it. Kah Kah will want to meet new hozen friend.His camp south at Grookin Hill."
4940,"Tactical Mana Bombs : Ah, $p, just the <race> I was looking for. I have received another batch of tactical mana bombs that I need planted in key positions across Dawnseeker Promontory to the northwest.Here, take these. It is time to give the Sunreavers a taste of their own medicine.Plant one on the Sunreaver ships, another one on their scrying crystals, and the last on the bridge that connects to their forward base."
4941,"Thelonius : When we last spoke, I promised to tell you the secret of Fat Long-Fat. I still plan to tell you that secret... after I determine your worth.I will meet you on the western shore, and we will duel."
4942,"Round 4: The P.U.G. : And now the final round. I have selected three challengers for you to face. This may seem unfair... to a weakling. You are not a weakling, correct?Go to the main temple, stand in the grand arena, and face these three challengers. Prove you are stronger than their combined power!Good luck, Challenger!"
4943,"Rending Daggers : Forget about them, and forget their BREW. We've got real work to do.The scroll mentions ""rending daggers of the great ones"". I've got a feeling I know where to find them.A pair of mantid lieutenants patrol the Horrid March, to the south. Each one carries a ceremonial dagger.Bring those daggers back here, <name>. We may be on the brink of something big."
4944,"Why Not Scallions? : I heard Haohan mentioning that he was going to plant scallions today. I'm not sure if today's the best day for scallions, but I'd like to hope that he knows what he's doing. He is the head of the Tillers' union, after all.Could you plant a scallion for me?"
4945,Return to Mistfall : We have done all we can here. We know how much the mogu are a clear threat.  The forge is in great danger of falling into their hands if we lose our hold on the Vale.  Let us return to Mistfall and report to the Rajani. They will want to know what we are up against.
4946,"The Big Kah-Oona : The leader of the Oona hozen is a brigand by the name of Lord Oona.I have heard fearsome tales of this roaming sea captain and his crew. Everywhere he takes his tribe, destruction follows.The Oona land their boats on fertile soil, pillage the local villages, and drain the land dry before moving on to their next conquest.We shall not allow the same to occur on our shores, not while I am still in charge.I need someone to go eradicate him now."
4947,"Burn Out! : Those goblins are gettin' out of hand! First they level the forest and set up that abomination of a rig. Then, they start dumpin' their oil barrels into the bay!We got to put a stop to this madness! At the very least we need ta set them back.We need to take out their fuel supply! Maybe you'll even get to kill a few goblins in the process!"
4948,WANTED: Chief Engineer Cogwrench : Wanted for crimes against the Bilgewater Operation!Chief Engineer Cogwrench was last seen building what appeared to be a giant spider tank on the edge of Bilgewater Beach.Extreme caution should be used when approaching.A large reward has been posted for Cogwrench's destruction.
4949,"It Is A Mystery : We have detected several... anomalies in these mines, of an arcane or spiritual nature. They are disrupting our attempts to discern the nature of the magic used in the spirit binding rituals here.  They are quite elusive, but we've managed to isolate the arcane signature of one of these anomalies, and one of our mages has enchanted this bauble with its signature.  Take the bauble. It will begin to glow more brightly as you approach the anomaly. Once you reach it, you can use the bauble to draw it out."
4950,"Fallen Sentinels : Our sentinels can fight for days on end, but even they have their limits. Since the mantid swarm began, too many of them have pushed themselves beyond their abilities.Please, aid them in whatever way you can. If you are unable to heal them yourself, you may give them some of this. A mouthful of nutritious yak's milk will give them the strength they need."
4951,"Pristine Mantid Lamp : This artifact has been restored to a remarkably excellent condition.  Perhaps you will put it on display at the Seat of Knowledge, so that lorewalkers and archaeologists can study it."
4952,"Practically Perfect Produce : Here, <name>. My father will be wanting this.Thank you, again, for helping with the virmen."
4953,"A Neighbor's Duty : I'm not the only one having trouble with his stock, it seems. One of Francis' sheep has wandered over to my ranch, for the third time this week. I'm beginning to think he needs help tending to his flock.You should check up on him, neighbor. And bring this poor little thing with you."
4954,"Materia Medica : Alright, Ken-Ken pretty sure he knows what wrong with pandaren! Got old, old hozen remedy that do the trick.Need to mix honey, fish oil, and salt. Ken-Ken saw lots of beehives in the trees around town, and there must be fish left in the dry ponds.That just leave salt... Mei might know where we can find some."
4955,"Back to Nature : I'm afraid I have another favor to ask, <name>.The bottles you recovered contain neither the spirits of mogu ancestors nor recently slain foes; they contain spirits of beasts. It seems the spiritclaws have resorted to poaching in an effort to fuel their simulacra.This complicates our task, for I cannot take the beasts with me through the bridge.Take the bottles west to Tideview Thicket and smash them to return the spirits to nature. Some may be blind with rage and will need to be subdued."
4956,
4957,Rebuilding the Mallet (Tracker) : Time for the fixing and then time for the mixing!
4958,
4959,"Thinning The Pack : The past few seasons have been plentiful, and as a result, the wild tiger population on Windward Isle has exploded.The savage creatures have hunted out all the nearby game, and are beginning to encroach upon the cloud serpent nests.As a result, as the tigers thrive, the cloud serpents decline.If we are not careful, the predatory cats could completely wipe them out.We must thin the tigers' numbers, <race>."
4960,"Work Order: The Klaxxi I : <Though Yoon's writing leaves something to be desired, it's nice to still have a little piece of him on the farm.>An order came in this morning from the Klaxxi. Strangely enough they are requesting mogu pumpkins for some kind of research.I find it's best not to ask them too many questions...Best get started on their order. I'd hate to see what a bug of that size could do to your crops if you don't!"
4961,"Unwelcome Intruders : Those are mantid scouts down there. Gao-Ran's Battlefront is meant to keep them out of eastern Townlong Steppes. If we allow them north of the barricade, we may lose our foothold here.Let's clear them out. I'll be with you."
4962,"The Unending Siege : The mantid continue to attack us. Their numbers ebb and flow, but they do not stop.It is no matter. The yak is stamina embodied. We will not bend to them.  We will defend his home forever.Will you help us?"
4963,"Fear Takes Root : The fallout from Shek'zeer's madness will continue long after her reign has ended. We will struggle to heal our lands for many years to come, and even then our efforts may prove fruitless.A new species of sha-twisted flora has begun taking root near Zan'vess. Destroy any that you find, but beware - there is no telling what kind of sinister defenses it may have."
4964,"The Siege Swells : Today's mantid swarm is among the worst I've seen. We are lucky to have Niuzao join us in battle.Help him, <class>. Return to the courtyard, and join in the defense of our temple."
4965,The Late Mrs. Muskpaw : This well worn trinket has several markings on it confessing love and adoration from the late Mrs. Muskpaw.Perhaps Lao would like his wife's trinket back.
4966,"Re-Reclaim : Mogu are thugs. They have always been thugs.Only when they ruled their empires in the old stories did they ever know any kind of magic.But these mogu are using arcane portals and spells. We need to stop them!$p, look for any artifacts the mogu are using to cast their magics with. I saw a number of their collectors and reclaimers to the west and north that were gathering these items."
4967,"The Threads that Stick : Ah, welcome traveler. I have need of your services!Syra Goldendraft was looking for some silk. Personally I hate silk as it always gets stuck in my fur.I really want to impress her though.If you bring me some silk from the Silkwood to the west of here I will gladly pay you for your help."
4968,"The Stoneplow Convoy : Help me, $p. These poor pandaren are in need of healing, and my powers are weakened.I did find an old tome in my collection that allowed me to convert the herbs you collected earlier into a healing poultice.Use this on the injured pandaren and it should get them back on their feet."
4969,"A Gift For Tina : That Tina Mudclaw is in the Halfhill Market today, visiting her sister. She's really nice, but she's really hard to get gifts for!There's a little jewel that can be found in the cliffs to the north. It's called a chrysoberyl, and it changes color when you hold it. I'll bet she doesn't have one of THOSE!Look inside the virmen caves. I bet you'll find one really fast."
4970,"Red Blossom Leeks, You Make the Croc-in' World Go Down : Grandpa once told me that the smell of leeks will keep crocolisks off of your property. He must have had a point... he always grew leeks, and I never saw a crocolisk anywhere NEAR his farm.We're pretty far from the water... but I suppose you can never be too sure."
4971,"""Thunder King"" Pest Repellers : <An imposing image of a mogu face dominates this box, casting its gaze downward at neatly ordered rows of bold text.>""DO NOT LET WEAK, DISGUSTING INSECTS INFEST YOUR GLORIOUS CROPS. CONQUER THEM WITH THE MIGHT OF THE THUNDER KING AND PROTECT YOUR LEGACY.""<The rest of the space is dedicated to cartoon depictions of various insects crying out in lament or fleeing in terror.>"
4972,"All Dead, All Dead : Our Warchief has dispatched me to these shores to deal with this pitiful Alliance threat.These humans and their allies have proven to be very dependent on their leaders. No initiative of their own.As you walk the battlefield today look to the Alliance ships off our southern shores. Find their captains.Slay them.For the Horde!"
4973,"Flash! Aaaaaahhhh! : The gnomes have brought their flying contraptions. I want my skies CLEAR!Get up there on whatever mount you have with you and destroy those paltry devices.You may use this grog I ""acquired"" from our goblin allies. It would be better served blasting down gyrocopters than in the gullet of those little green fiends."
4974,"The Seven Burdens of Shaohao : Dear $p,It would seem you have discovered the full tale of Shaohao, the last emperor of Pandaria.If you visit us at the Seat of Knowledge in Vale of Eternal Blossoms we can add this contribution to your personal collection.Thank you for your diligence!Sincerely,Lorewalker Cho"
4975,"A Taste For Eggs : I can sense your anxiety, but you are not ready yet. Your training must continue before you perform the final test. As for your task... I need you to fetch me some eggs.Yes, eggs. The marshland atop the hills to the east is home to a number of birds, all of which are generally peaceful in nature. You should have no trouble gathering enough eggs to last me several weeks."
4976,Among the Bones : My scouts have spotted a dangerous Zandalari among the bones west of Ihgaluk Crag. I need someone capable to see him dispatched. Are you up to the task?
4977,"And a Heavy Fist : The greenwood sprites in the Waxwood Forest to the west pose no direct threat to us, this is true. However, their numbers have increased as of late, as have their wily antics.Part of our duty as wardens of this forest is to maintain the balance. Your duty is to do so by returning these sprites to the earth."
4978,Overpowered : The Kirin Tor are using mana foci to empower their forces. We cannot allow this to continue.You'll find these foci scattered around the outskirts of Violet Rise. Use this mana crystal to destroy as many as you can.Each mana focus we destroy is another small victory for our cause.
4979,"... and the Pot, Too! : Sure, I'm willing to help you guys out. But we need to eat, too! I don't even have a pot to cook in! Let alone ingredients to put in it!Here's a list of the things that I need. Now get!"
4980,"Scouting Report: On the Right Track : MOST of what Riko said is true.We didn't dare pursue Gorrok - the Horde's numbers here are far too few. Our forces can only sustain so many losses, and frankly, we don't know how powerful that witch really is.Let me pick up where the hozen left off..."
4981,"Break the Cycle : <Mogu conjurers call forth hapless spirits from beyond, forcing them into statues.It seems that destroying the statues alone will not be enough to break the cycle.>"
4982,"Herbal Remedies : Kang's remedy isn't working.There is something else at work here. A power deep beneath the soil. It is sapping us of hope, hitting us with depression and despair.Kang tells me this land has lotus plants. I might be able to make a tea that would hopefully lend Leza some strength.Please, $p, search the ruins south and west of here for lotus leaves. I will pay you for your efforts."
4983,"Even Giants Fall : The Zandalari worship the loa; animal spirits they often call to their aid. They may be trying to bind these spirits into a huge golem. The outcome would be disastrous.I've sent ahead a scout to gather more information, but I think this task may require your expertise.Stop that ritual at all costs!"
4984,"Mann's Man : <For once, the foreman lowers her voice.>Look, this ain't easy... I got another favor to ask. My idiot husband, Hao, is a shift lead down at the quarry. I told him not to go back, that it was too dangerous, but he's as stubborn as a hozen and twice as stupid. Says the boys need him around for ""moral support.""<Mann sneers.>What about my moral support?! What am I gonna do if that idiot dies?!Please... keep an eye out for him. Tell him to come home.<Her eyes soften before she turns away.>"
4985,Imposing Threat : One of Vereesa's scouts has returned with word of a mogu leader under the central tower. He needs to be removed.Would you be willing to handle this?
4986,"Get My Results! : Ah, $p. The Warchief has instructed me to dispatch you to Silvermoon.He grows impatient with the progress of Lor'themar's research and feels they might benefit from your... unique... experiences with the mogu.Go to Silvermoon and demand that Lor'themar increase the speed of his research."
4987,"A Dash of That : 100 Buttonbelly Mushrooms. Must be freshly harvested from a wet, dark place.<Scrawled along the edge of the page is a hand-written note.>Fungus is very good for the health! (Or it might kill you, cause serious illness, rash, hallucination, or loosen bowels. Note to self - MUST be careful when selecting wild mushrooms!)"
4988,"Legacy of the Korune : I'm not prepared to throw away more of our people fighting against an enemy we don't know or understand.   See if you can find any clues in the area as to who exactly these ""Korune"" mogu are. A contingency in case this operation doesn't go as planned."
4989,
4990,"Tracking the Thieves : We WILL get to the bottom of this.  <name>, you're coming with me. We'll search every inch of this city if we have to, but we'll find out how they took the bell... and where.  I'm picking up traces of arcane magic here... we need to follow the trail!"
4991,"Monkey Mischief : Strange tales have reached our ears from Sri-La Village.It seems that a hozen tribe has made itself comfortable in Oona Kagu, a cave along the coast south of the fishing village.Too comfortable, in fact. The tribe members are stealing and pillaging resources all along the coast.We must teach them a lesson... one that can only be taught by force. They have already overstayed their welcome."
4992,"Your Private Collection : Pandaria is rich with history, legends, stories, and lore of every sort. While you are traveling throughout the world I would ask that you keep an eye open for artifacts and pieces of information that you feel would be pertinent to our work here.When you accumulate enough knowledge, we will compile it in to a volume for your personal collection here.You can, of course, return whenever you like to review the volumes we are making for you."
4993,"Shortcut to Ruin : There is a champion among the loyalists, Vess-Guard Na'kal, whose strength comes not from experience or development, but from genetic modification. He was meant to be an example of the future of mantid - the sick idea that we can be born strong, without earning it.He's a mockery of my work! Gene augmentation was meant for mature, post-swarm veterans ONLY!End him. Perhaps it will serve as a lesson to Grand Empress Shek'zeer that taking shortcuts leads to ruin."
4994,
4995,Warchief's Command: Dread Wastes! : All able-bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Bowmistress Li on the Serpent's Spine in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.  The Shado-Pan are attempting to stop the mantid army from invading the entirety of Pandaria.  You can reach Bowmistress Li by securing a kite and flying to the Serpent's Spine.  Destiny calls!
4996,"The Search for Restless Leng : One of my best scouts, Restless Leng, went missing during a mission on the other side of Sik'vess. I'm hopeful that he was captured rather than killed, but with the mantid corrupted so heavily by sha, it doesn't seem likely.Still, can you investigate the cages around Sik'vess? I owe him a more thorough search than even this, but I have no men to spare without allowing our southern lines to break.Please, <class>, even if there's no life left in him, find him that I might know his fate."
4997,"They All Fall Down : The Zandalari do not tolerate weakness in their ranks, <class>.Those that are deemed weak are often sacrificed in barbaric ceremonies. The victims' spirits are captured and entombed within the sentries you see guarding the grounds.I wish to study their essence. For this I will need your help.Take this resonance crystal and siphon the spirits from the sentry corpses. Do not allow them to escape!"
4998,"Encroaching Force : We've received word of a Zandalari war party up the beach, north of our foothold. We need them hunted down and killed.Are you willing to do this thing for us, <class>?"
4999,"Huck Wheelbarrow : Usually our trainees are adventurers like yourself, or monks from Tian Monastery, or occasionally retired Shado-Pan. Very rarely, though, we will greet trainees that have no fighting experience whatsoever.Huck Wheelbarrow is one such trainee. He has requested a duel with you. Look for him on the island's western shore."
5000,"Restoring the Balance : The situation at the islands remains dire, <name>.The Slitherscale saurok have not responded to our attempts at peace, so only one option remains.In order to protect the wild cloud serpents, we must rid the island of their presence. Only then can the cloud serpents be left to live in peace."
5001,"An Unexpected Advantage : Things seem to be goin' our way more and more lately, <name>. I was out doin some explorin' when I came upon this little beauty.<Sully gestures to the ballista to his right.>Problem is she's one of a set and the other one is still in pieces. I'd have gotten it together by now if those pesky Grimleers hadn't ambushed me and taken some of the gears and bolts.Hey, ye seem to be pretty good at handlin' the natives. Ye wouldn't mind goin' and helpin' ol'Sully out would ye?"
5002,
5003,"Hatred Becomes Us : I should have suspected a sha presence earlier!We are safe as long as we stand inside the Totem of Harmony's protective wards, but many of our people were not so lucky.They were trapped outside the camp when the sha's powers manifested, and now they turn upon each other!Take one of my totems with you. Place the totem near a crazed ally to purify them, but beware.You may have to face the darkness that gripped them."
5004,The Cost of War : This whole place is going up in flames and the Skyfire is reporting that more of those... shadows are crawling up out of the ground. We need to get our people out of here.Clear a path through the base on your way north and head for the town. I will rendezvous with you there.
5005,
5006,"Ashyo's Vision : Have a look at that!<Ashyo motions at the massive waterfall to the north.>This must be the water supply for the whole valley!Think about it, <name>: the pandaren use this water to grow vegetables the size of a house. Where could it come from? What is so special about it?The elders among my people know a technique for speaking with the water and divining the future. Perhaps this same technique can provide insight into the water's source...It's worth a shot at least!"
5007,Captive Audience : The Kirin Tor have gone too far! Now they hold our fellow Sunreavers as war prisoners!There will be no discussion of prisoner exchange. We will handle this ourselves.Go to Violet Rise and free as many prisoners as you can. Do not get captured yourself. We cannot afford to lose you too.

The reports indicate they are attacking the mist lurkers in the area. Find out why and put an end to it!"
5009,
5010,"Monstrosity : It's plain to see that this statue and the surrounding ruins are of ancient origin. Clearly, this land has a deep history, which means it could not have been born of the cataclysm.And yet these waters have been explored for ages now, with no record of anything here but open sea.Perhaps if you were to sketch the pieces of this broken statue, you might shed light on the continent's origins."
5011,"Thieving Raiders : Saurok!These vile creatures are obsessed with killing and stealing. They attacked our settlement without provocation or warning.Please, <class>, can you aid us?Help us recover our lost possessions from these Riverblade raiders that march along the river and we will gladly reward you."

5014,"Bad Blood : The Explorer's League is here to excavate the ruins, and it's my job to protect them.When we arrived, we found this place crawling with blood elves. Apparently,the Horde are just as interested in the mogu as we are.This gives quite an opportunity to thin our enemies' numbers, and steal their findings, too.Slay any blood elves you find in the ruins, and bring back whatever they are digging up."
5015,"Find the Boy : Have you seen my son, Lo? He was here a moment ago and I told him we were leaving today.I'm sure he's off trying to woo that young Syra Goldendraft.

Any chance you could head out there and look for them?"
5016,"Round 2: Clever Ashyo & Ken-Ken : You may know your next challengers. They were arguing fiercely when they arrived, so I have charged them with fighting side by side.This will teach them the strength of friendship, and possibly entertain me in the process.Go to the north eastern arena and face this jinyu and hozen.Do not be gentle, they need to learn to work together."
5017,Relics of the Swarm : This strange-looking carving is covered in a complex written language that might be mantid in origin.You notice more relics strewn carelessly among the camps and inside the lake.Perhaps the Klaxxi would be interested in examining these artifacts.Who knows? Perhaps it will earn you some favor.

Cubs wrestle playfully on his shoulders and dangle from his muscular arms.At his side, a stoic female - of equally impossible physique - balances a massive, overflowing cornucopia gracefully on her head while kicking a virmen in the face.>""The Earth-Slasher. Master the land. Master your life."""
5019,"Hints From The Past : There is much to learn of this place, yet it does not yield its secrets willingly.Something you mentioned the last time that we spoke intrigues me. This Mistweaver Ai, she carries a time-worn journal, if I recall? This may be the answer to many of our questions, or it may simply raise more. I suppose that it all depends on the diligence of the explorer that put pen to paper in this preposterous place.Obtain a time-worn journal and return to me with it. We shall delve into its mysteries together."
5020,
5021,"Running Rampant : There is one thing that every army needs, and that is a supply line.The enemy camp to the west contains a large beast herd, which serves as the yaungol army's main source of food.Luckily for us, the yaks and mushan beasts of this region are easily scared.Sneak in, give the beasts a good slap, and watch the results."

How's a girl supposed to get any work done with them gobbling up the miners AND the ore?!This seemed like a good opportunity to use my newest invention, Bug Off. See, all you have to do is spray this stuff all over the shale spiders. They hate it and it doesn't seem to have many long term side-effects for the miners!What could possibly go wrong?Take this handy sprayer and get to work!"
5025,"Pristine Remains of a Paragon : This artifact has been restored to a remarkably excellent condition.  Perhaps you will put it on display at the Seat of Knowledge, so that lorewalkers and archaeologists can study it."
5026,"In Sprite Of Everything : The sprites of Shan'ze Dao have always been capricious tricksters, but now they have fallen under the mogu's influence.Even as we speak, they gather under a new leader.We cannot allow this to happen.Their mischievous pranks were one thing, but united, their dark magic is too powerful and too dangerous to comprehend.Take out their leader before it is too late."

5029,"Pandaren Prisoners : Look, I know the Horde needs recruits, and there's just not enough of us here right now to make a fighting presence of this town.  But I know that the yaungol over at Fire Camp Ordo, to the west, have taken many of my people as prisoners. And I also know that if you would be willing to rescue them from their captivity, they'd more than likely be willing to join the Horde.  What do you say, <name>?"

5035,"Lingering Doubt : I heard that there has been some strange behavior down at The Widow's Wail to the north.Hyacinth and I went to investigate, and I am certain that some presence of the sha has found its way into the cavern.I created this device to measure sha energy levels.If you are going that way, would you mind taking measurements of any sha disturbances?The disturbances look like streams of white and black sha energy pouring from the ground."
5036,"Attack! Move! : Sure, they've got about plenty of grunts out there, pounding on our door, waiting to cut our heads off.  I'm not worried about grunts. But they've got shamans and raiders, too. The shamans use their magic to empower the grunts, and the raiders are fast and specialize in taking out our buildings.  I need you to get out there and kill some of those shamans and raiders.  Go! Attack! Move!"
5037,"The Dark Heart of the Mogu : Dear $p,We have always known the mogu to be dark and sinister.

5051,"Tear It Up : The Alliance may be cowardly, but they are not fools. Their assault would be formidable, if it were directed at lesser creatures.To sustain a siege and put pressure on our troops they are air dropping in supplies to support their ground forces.Search the beaches and docks to the south for any airdropped supplies and smash them.Let the Alliance see their food and ammunition destroyed before their eyes and despair."

Let me know when you are ready."

I'm just going to assume that they were shoulder-mounted rocket launchers until I'm proven wrong.Point is, in the arms of a skilled <class> like you, they could probably take down a chopper.

His mask, known only as the Silent Skull, is legendary among the clan, and could help us learn more about them.  Until recently, he was thought to have vanished.

What do you say?"

And before you go, thank you for all you've done for us here, truly. You and your army have turned the tides of a war that you could have just as easily walked away from. We will not forget."

Carry one crystal at a time to the three pylons that surround the ward, then activate the control panel nearby!"
5112,Quakefist : I'm getting reports of a giant in the forest.A few of the Karabor peacekeepers have followed it to a cave. In all honesty I don't think any of our troops are willing to engage the beast.Maybe you could investigate? I'm sure the peacekeepers would appreciate the help.
5113,"Pinchwhistle Gearworks : Commander, a courier arrived this morning.He said he's from a goblin settlement to the southeast called the Pinchwhistle Gearworks. They've asked for our assistance with some sort of ecological disaster.We're spread thin but if we can earn their trust then we might be able to gain a valuable ally.Head down there and see what sort of assistance we can provide. I've already spoken to the flight master and he's set up a special flight to get you out there."
5114,Lost Lumberjacks : Shelly and her crew haven't returned from Gloomshade Grove.It's been days... I hope everything is okay.
5115,"Chains of Iron : The artifact we seek is within our grasp.Be prepared for a fight. If they truly have learned how to control gronn, this may be more difficult than I anticipated.I will join you in this battle as soon as you arrive."
5116,"The Silent Skull: Taking from the Taker : With the reagents found, you should seek out Grinning Tolg's camp in the nearby cave to brew the elixir.   Once the elixir is consumed, you should be able to communicate with the ravagers there. With any luck, they should be able to bring you to Skulltaker.  His mask should bring a hefty reward."
5117,"Ring of Trials: Crushmaul : So you want to fight in the Ring of Trials do you? It's your funeral, bub!Your first fight is against an exceptionally large and angry ogre named Crushmaul. That's not all though, you'll have to take out his armored boar companion too; Crushmaul never goes into the ring without him!I hope your affairs are in order, because the last gladiator that fought Crushmaul went home in a body bag...I'm counting on you! Get your ass inside the arena and speak with my associate Guzrug to start the fight!"
5118,
5119,"Naval Domination : Our naval domination continues!However, we are going to need even more experience and resources to take this shipyard to the next level.  Once we reach our goals, we can upgrade the capacity of the shipyard to hold even more ships!"
5120,"Back from Beyond : We must begin preparations for the Talon King's return.From within this realm, I can travel quickly to Veil Terokk.You, however, should be returned to the other side. You are powerful, and will attract unwanted attention."
5121,"We Need An Outpost : Commander, we've gathered enough materials to build an outpost that will support our mission against the Iron Horde.How shall we proceed?A lumber yard would be valuable for gathering resources in the dense overgrowth to the south, and in confronting the plant monstrosities that defend it.On the other hand, a sparring arena would provide us the brutish forces we'd need to push through the magnaron wastelands to the north.When you're ready, make your choice on the table."
5122,"The Might of the Warsong : <The officer is in a great deal of pain. It's clear that he's not long for this world.>The Warsong. Surprise attack.Headed into... the Burning Blade....<He takes a moment, before continuing.>They took the... blueprints....<These are his last words.>"
5123,"Vouchsafe Our Arrival : A matter of great importance has arisen. While you were away, Archmage Khadgar contacted me.He is investigating demonic influences to the north.Being a human, the Frostwolves will not accept Khadgar without you there to vouch for him, nor will they accept a night elf such as myself.I will wait for you outside Throm'var in the Frostwind Crag."
5124,"Ominous Portents : Now that Priestess Moonfang has created the blessed water, it is time to deal with the demon.Take the water and the scripture of Elune.Through the power of each, you will compel the demon to show us what the orcs are up to at Gul'var."
5125,"Upgrading The Fleet : You have been doing a great job out there commander.  However, we are going to need more experience and resources to upgrade this shipyard.  Once we reach our goals, we can upgrade the capacity of the shipyard to hold more ships!"
5126,
5127,"The Laughing Skull : Ah, $p, good. I need someone who is not of my clan to negotiate with the Laughing Skull.We could use their help navigating this land, but they are dangerous and unpredictable, much like Gorgrond itself.Follow this road and seek out someone willing to speak with you.Perhaps they will see you as something new and be willing to talk first and stab later."
5128,"Not Without My Honor : The blade is not the only important item a blademaster carries.Once he has passed his final tests in the Masters' Caverns, the blademaster is given the honor of wearing the Burning Blade's banner.When my petition to reclaim my rightful place with the clan fell upon deaf and craven ears, I was stripped of that honor.No doubt, my banner has been stored away somewhere in Hallvalor. They'll give it to some other aspiring blademaster if they don't burn it first."
5129,"Mulverick's Plight : You were sent here to free me? It seems that makes us allies.Slavemaster Turgall within the Soostained Mines will certainly have the key to this cage.While you're in there, do you think you could see which of those spineless taskmasters took my axes?"
5130,"Return to Veil Terokk : <A small note is tied to the kaliri's foot.>""Percy should have brought with him a basket of goods, assuming he didn't dump it off somewhere along the way. The contents are a token of my gratitude and an apology for the altercation with your scout.I must urge you to return to Veil Terokk so we may press forward with our plans.- Reshad """
5131,Iyu : There is a genesaur here!It wants its artifact back.Kaz and Draka are fighting it now on the surface but they need you. Draka said I could fire the big gun. So I will stay here and do that.
5132,"Onslaught's End : ""Guard Gul'dan and his Shadow Council with your lives! The portal cannot function without our prisoners' fel magic. Fail me and watch all that you hold dear turn to ash.-Grommash Hellscream.""The Iron Horde appear to be holding prisoners that are crucial to keeping the portal open. Search the nearby spires!"
5133,"The Pale Threat : If we are to succeed in stopping Cho'gall from destroying the naaru, we will need to fight our way through the Underpale; a dark, winding cavern infested with the Pale.The Pale are fallen orcs that despise all that is good and holy. The longer they are left to their devices beneath the ground, the further their dark plots progress.Make your way into the Underpale, slay the vile creatures within and take out their leader, Greyseer."
5134,"Naval Commander : You're a natural at this, <name>. You've got the salt in your veins. Now it's time to run our first naval mission and control the seas of Draenor!You will want a high vantage point to plan out these seafaring missions.  I know a good spot just up the path behind us. Meet me near the shipyard entrance and we can get started on our first mission."
5135,"Welcome to Gorgrond : Gorgrond is one of the most untamed landscapes in all of Draenor.Only the most skilled of rangari venture this deep into the wilds.It is their camp we are heading for. If you wish to travel ahead, it can be found down this path and to the right.Maraad and I shall follow after you momentarily. We still have some logistics to work out before we leave the landing."
5136,Gloomshade Game Hunter : <You find a list on a piece of parchment.Arsenio needs some ingredients for a new recipe he's preparing at your garrison.>
5137,"To Catch a Shadow : Gul'dan is on the Shadow Rise just up the hill to the west. But, you must hurry, <name>. We know that he's about to leave for Talador and Frostfire Ridge.The use of the soul trap is straightforward. Simply point and shoot to ensnare Gul'dan. The crystal will take care of the rest.I'll see you back at Starfall Outpost when you have him.Good luck."
5138,A Gathering of Shadows : Veil Terokk is just ahead.Let us hope the others have made the journey safely.
5139,"The Dark Heart of Oshu'gun : We are not far from the inner chamber, <name>. The truth behind the evil here awaits us.I can project my spirit into the chamber to guide you, but it will be up to you to defeat the evil that lays within.May the wind of Kalandrios guide your arm, the wisdom of Aborius enlighten your faculties, and the flame of Incineratus burn your enemies.May the memory of Gordawg be your shield."
5140,"The Clarity Elixir : I see a thousand glimpses of the future, swimming in a chaotic blur.It is possible to focus my energies to see the true eventuality - the future most likely to come to pass.I will need an oracle stone to focus my power, and a special elixir to still my mind.To make the elixir, I will need the following ingredients: wing dust from Swamplighters along the river, fresh hearts from a monstrously-sized hydra, and a rare star lily.Meet me at Moonwillow Peak when this task is done."
5141,"Free Our Brothers and Sisters : These Thunderlord curs use coward's weapons like nets and chains.Many of our villagers and wolf-brothers and sisters have been trapped.If you free them, they will fight at your side with honor.We must quell this attack with haste so I may return to Bladespire Citadel and continue my preparations."
5142,"A Choice to Make : We're ready to start building. All that we need is for you to make a choice.The blueprints are on the drafting table. Take a look.Then, let me know if we're going to construct a corral or a tankworks."
5143,"Treasure Contract: Amulet of Rukhmar : It seems the Adherents of Rukhmar have stumbled upon some information leading to an ancient amulet, said to possess the power of their god and bestow it upon the wearer. We should make sure they don't find it.  Head to Skettis and find what they have learned. Hopefully we can find it before they get to it."
5144,"Through the Looking Glass : Your allies sent along a goblin, Gazlowe, to advise us against the Iron Horde. Thus far, he has proven a valuable asset.  He has a looking glass set up that can see a great distance and, he claims, even hear.  Use this looking glass and report back what you've seen. I will stick to my standard spyglass."
5145,"At Your Command : Commander, the outpost is nearly fully operational.Gazlowe provided us with two different blueprints to fill this final plot - an Arsenal or an Arcane Sanctum.Either one would provide us with the additional firepower we need to stop the Iron Horde's advance.The plans are on the drafting table. It's your call."
5146,"Gutrek's Cleaver: The Spirit Forge : With the pieces recovered, all that is left is to reforge Gutrek's Cleaver. Goldspade's journal seems to indicate that the only place to do this is the location where it was initially dismantled.  The journal mentions a ""Spirit Forge"" used to dismantle the blade, and that it may be located somewhere in the nearby gorge. Find the forge and use it to combine the pieces you've gathered."
5147,"Scraps of Iron : At the armory, we can take scraps of Iron Horde armor that you collect and turn them into new gear. It's not the strongest stuff in the world, but it looks good.  Get some Iron Horde scraps and come back my way. I'll set you up with a nice tabard for your troubles."
5148,"Into Twilight : The safety of my people is of the utmost priority.It is likely that Ner'zhul has taken the prisoners to Shaz'gul, his stronghold to the southwest.I do not wish to use aggression against him, but he may force my hand.Meet me at Twilight Glade, <name>. Then, we shall try our best to recover the prisoners."
5149,
5150,"Tricks of the Trade : To pass the time, traders have been known to consume beverages of an inspired nature, if you know what I mean.  Sometimes, they drink a bit too much. Your trader might have stumbled beyond the gates and passed out under a tree. It's been known to happen from time to time.  Luckily, I have a brew that I use to rouse groggy traders. One splash and I find they're more willing to work."
5151,"We Be Needin' Supplies : Commander, our forces are not prepared for frost fightin'. I took da liberty and sent some of our shadow hunters north to establish a supply base. Ya might want to be headin' up dere and see what they be up to. Look for a hollow between the Crackling Plains and the Savage Crag."
5152,"Escape From Shaz'gul : I've failed, <name>...My squadron was caught by a wandering patrol. We fought fiercely, but the alarm had been raised. The rangari forced me into hiding before surrendering themselves to the enemy.They were under MY command, and they gave their lives... for what? I... I'm not sure what to do, <name>.We need to get out of here, but how?"
5153,"Gronnsbane: The Blessing of Frost : The weapon has been imbued with the Blessing of Fire, drawing power from the Molten Shamanstone. The Frozen Shamanstone should impart the next blessing. Argoram mentions its location in his journal:  ""As I was maneuvering away from the great boulders hurled at me by the ogron brutes, I glanced what looked like another monolith atop the tallest of the snow-capped towers in Bloodmaul. Perhaps this is the Frozen Shamanstone, which is thought to grant the Blessing of Frost"""
5154,"The Defense of Karabor : Defend Karabor from the Iron Horde.At the end of the northern courtyard is Arnokk the Burner. He guards the entrance to the harbor behind Karabor, where the main Iron Horde army is waiting.Once we've taken care of him, we'll need to deal with the Iron Horde leader, Commander Vorka."
5155,"And Justice for Thrall : The time has come, commander. You've dealt with all of the Warsong's allies and holdings.Our troops are massing at the gates of Grommashar. The shadow hunters have reliable intel that Garrosh is holed up inside the Warsong fortress.All of our efforts have led to this moment. Let's put an end to this once and for all."
5156,"Into Anguish : Rulkan's gift to you, the Fragment of Anguish, will allow you to pass into the fortress unhindered. Go up these stairs to the doorway, then use the fragment to enter the compound.Once you are inside, you will find three altars powering the magical barrier around their stronghold.Destroy these runes, and Yrel and I will be able to join you in finding Ner'zhul."
5157,"Arakkoa Exodus : I assume you're familiar with the arakkoa, commander? Great, flying birdfolk. Extremely territorial.  Some, however, have withered wings - a disease, maybe. They seem to be outcast from arakkoa society. You find them now and then, squatting in forgotten ruins or peddling trinkets on the roadside.  It seems the Iron Horde has incited the arakkoa by moving into their lands, and the outcasts are fleeing in droves.  We should make contact with these outcasts - they could have valuable information."
5158,"The Fate of Karabor : Threads of the future weave together, winding and unwinding, creating tapestries that change in form and color from one moment to the next.I must have clarity. I must focus on the ONE strand that will become reality.When you are ready to share in my vision, drink the elixir.When the vision begins, be on your guard. The events of the vision are as deadly as anything we experience in this reality."
5159,"WANTED: Kil'uun : It's that damned bird!Every few hours, this blasted thing flies right past here, and none of these idiots will stop it.""It's got the crazy in its eyes,"" they tell me. Pah!Commander, this bird will be the end of me. If you see it, could you cut off its stupid head and give it to me?It'd make me feel better."
5160,
5161,"Clear! : Oh, the gnomanity!The Pleasure-Bot 8000 broke before it could bring me a single Draenor truffle. It swam here and shorted its power fluctuator.AGAIN!I have power going to it, but it isn't enough to override the fluctuator.Could you get me the sacs from the electric eels in the lake? I think that would be just the ticket!"
5162,"The Shadow of the Void : The moment has come to take on the void lord. Invalidus grows more powerful by the minute, so you must move with haste if you are to defeat the monster.At each of the Warsong ritual locations there is a void crystal; these crystals are used to channel the energy of the void from within the Twisting Nether.Disturb the crystal, and Invalidus will sense your presence below.Be ready, as soon as the crystal is disturbed, Invalidus will waste no time hunting you down."
5163,"Preventing the Worst : Have you seen all the fungus on the buildings in Pinchwhistle Point? It's only a matter of time 'til it releases enough spores to infest the whole coastline!The remaining infected that are in Pinchwhistle Point will be too far gone for us to save later on, so let's do the right thing and put them out of their misery and prevent an even worse outbreak.I made some firebombs that will burn the fungus down, but I'll need you to place them while I set up the detonator.Are you up for it?"
5164,The Home of the Frostwolves : You have arrived in Frostfire Ridge. Farseer Drek'Thar can guide you from here.
5165,"Syth's Secret : Our deceased friend here was hiding more than a love of old scrolls and erotic sorcery-fiction. He had something truly valuable.If I'm reading his notes correctly, he claims to have found the Eye of Anzu - Terokk's scrying orb from the days after his fall.We need that orb! The notes say he stashed it in a ravager den just up the road."
5166,"As the Smoke Rises : Aruuna burns.The arakkoa swooped down from their spires and are turning everything to ash. Draenei, talbuk, even orc; they care not for allegiances. They merely want to watch the world burn.I barely escaped with my life, but my best friend, Barum, stayed behind to find his daughter. The others all say you are a great champion. Please, I beg of you, go to Aruuna and find them."
5167,"Rotting Riverbeasts : The botani are infecting the local riverbeasts with some kind of strange flesh-eating plant.I fear this infection could spread to our people.If you see any infested riverbeasts, kill the blooming plants that inhabit their bodies... before they kill you."
5168,"Gazlowe's Solution : I've identified some high value targets down in the forest below.  When you get near one, you can deploy my solution.  Deploy it and the objectives will be neutralized with great ceremony."
5169,"Establish Your Garrison : It's time for the main event! We've got the materials, we've got the manpower, we've got another thing that starts with ""m.""Let's build this thing!I got a gaggle of assistants up on that ridge to the west.They should have your personal surveying stand set up by now.Head on over there and you should be able to watch our progress from it."
5170,"Let the Hunt Begin! : I have no time for my brother's whimpering. We hunt for vengeance or death.The Thunderlord chieftain slew my father and left me for dead, so I shall take his three sons, the first of which is this runt in my hand.This filth has revealed the number and positions of the Thunderlords in the ravine beyond.Join us, if you dare, and you will witness how real warriors of the Frostwolf clan fight. Get in my way, and I will end you."
5171,"Warlord of Draenor : Durotan...<Raza'kul spits.>He cowers behind the white flag of peace, relying upon diplomacy to win over our sworn enemies.Enemies that have taken our homes and driven us from our ancestral lands.There is only one way to deal with the draenei and their newfound alliance of cowards - blood for blood.Join me in crushing our enemies. Together we will flood this hallowed ground with the bones of the Alliance and earn tributes fit for a warchief!Return here when your bloodthirst is sated."
5172,"Your Base, Your Choice : You have already constructed an impressive garrison in Frostfire. I believe I should defer this next choice to you.One region of Gorgrond is rich in resources. A lumber mill could help us make the most of them.Another region harbors hardened gladiators. A sparring arena would help persuade them to fight for our cause.Either path will strengthen us as we seek to find and weaken the Iron Horde.Which do you choose, Commander?"
5173,Hero's Call: Gorgrond! : All able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Yrel in Gorgrond.  Yrel and Maraad are requesting for a small expedition to be sent into the wilds of Gorgrond.  We hope to gain a better understanding of the land in hopes that it will show us how to exploit weaknesses in the Iron Horde.  Assist them with their expedition.  Glory to the Alliance!
5174,"Tooth and Claw : These wimps lugging wood around the jungle keep talking about how dangerous it is. You know, between the ravager den to the south or the raptors that stalk Zorammarsh - hey, even the beach creatures or podlings have teeth!What do you say you and I do a little hunting? Collect teeth from wild beasts. The bigger the beast, the more teeth. Meet me back here and we'll compare our haul!"
5175,"For the Alliance! : We wouldn't have survived Tanaan without your strength, <name>. Many draenei and Alliance alike owe you a great debt.Before we departed for the Dark Portal, King Wrynn personally recommended that I place you in charge of our operations here in Draenor. After seeing you in action, I'm inclined to agree.This is your garrison to found. Plant the banner and we'll begin construction immediately, commander."
5176,
5177,"Dark Grimoire: Breaching the Barrier : The components have been gathered and the ""Arcane Bunker Buster"" is assembled. Hopefully, this should pack enough punch to take out the barrier.  There's only one way to find out..."
5178,"Dirgemire : In order to fully understand the nature and properties of the Zangarium Draenormycota, I need to examine the strain within a complex fungal structure. The fungal brain of a spore giant would do nicely.Not just any spore giant will serve though, it needs to be big... mean... primordial... the perfect specimen!In a cavern deep below the surface is an ancient spore giant the locals fearfully refer to as Dirgemire. Slay the monster, but be sure to carefully preserve the fungal brain for our research!"
5179,Qiana Moonshadow : If we are to win this war we are going to need more than foot soldiers. We need champions.Qiana Moonshadow's performance in Tanaan and Eventide Landing was quite impressive.Perhaps you should speak with her about taking on a greater role in the battle against the Iron Horde.
5180,"To the Garrison : My father is avenged. The sons of the Iron Wolf are all slain.Go to the garrison your people are constructing in the south. There, herald my return to my laggard brother.The time has come for the ""chieftain"" to be reminded of what it means to be a Frostwolf."
5181,"Sanketsu, The Burning Blade : The blade is searing hot to the touch. The jewel on its hilt stares at you, as if daring you to claim it.Perhaps someone at your garrison would be interested in seeing this weapon."
5182,"Gormaul Tower : It is time for us to strike out against those who would enslave us!We travel to Gormaul Tower to wrest it from the Bladespire ogres. I would welcome your company.Mount up, and together we will ride to battle!"
5183,"Darkness Falls : It is already beginning, over the hills to the southeast.Ner'zhul has everything he needs to summon the Dark Star. The Iron Horde attack on Karabor is imminent. This is where everything ends.Champion, I must ask you to ride ahead and delay Ner'zhul. I will join you as quickly as I can."
5184,"Closing the Door : The Shadowmoon orcs are using portals to bring in reinforcements and smuggle away draenei captives.If we are to have any hope of retaking the village, we must destroy the portals at once.The only way to do this is to kill the portalmasters who keep the rifts open."
5185,"Migrant Workers : <name>, more recruits arrive at your garrison every hour. We will soon run out of food.I have made contact with Exarch Akama in hopes of securing rations from Elodor, the breadbasket of this valley. He has agreed, provided we supply labor for the harvest. Everyone wins.If you agree with my plan, speak with Foreman Zipfizzle here in the courtyard - he has gathered together available laborers. Akama and I will escort them and meet you at Elodor, far to the east!"
5186,"These Colors Don't Run : Bladespire has been a plague on my people for many years.That ends today!Now to explain it to the ogres in a way they will understand.If you still wish to help us, place our banner in the corpses of our adversaries. Their courage will falter as they behold a field of Frostwolf trophies!This is our way. I will meet with you ahead when you have completed this deed."
5187,"The Battle for Shattrath : To stop the Iron Horde, we must overcome prejudice and work together, if only for this purpose.  Horde, Alliance, past, present... all meaningless in the face of this enemy.  We will retake Shattrath together... or die trying."

There's nowhere to go from here but the very top...the reigning champion of the Ring of Trials!The current champ is an arakkoa named Roakk the Zealot. Roakk is a lunatic! He says he's on some divine crusade for the sun or something.Crazy or not, he's one of the most dangerous fighters I've ever seen and has even fought in the Highmaul Coliseum!I'm not going to lie, you're probably going to die in there...good luck!"
5190,"Think of the Children! : When the Shadowmoon attacked Arbor Glen, everything was thrown into chaos.Many of us escaped, but there are still three children missing.I believe they are still back in the village.Please save them!"
5191,The Razorbloom : Kaalya thinks she picked up a trail. Seems a bunch of dwarves went north to Razorbloom by the signs.Problem is that place is filled with plant people. I ain't much use against plant people.Are you willing to investigate?
5192,WANTED: Keeho's Severed Paw : Posted by: Taskmaster GornekThe saberon known as Keeho poses a serious threat to Axefall.He has taken to slaughtering peons on the night shift and dragging their corpses to his den in the pridelands.Anyone who can bring me his severed paw as proof of his demise will be rewarded greatly.

5195,"Save Wolf Home : Cowardly Thunderlords...  During the battle for the citadel, runners informed me that the Iron Wolf is striking at our home. He'll find no easy footing there, Draka will make them pay tenfold for any of ours that they slay, but we must return quickly and chase the mongrels off.  You and your forces have proven valuable allies of the Frostwolves. We'd welcome your aid in securing our Wor'gol.  I'll see you on the battlefield if you choose to come."
5196,"What the Draenei Found : They came here for an artifact? The miners must have found something in our crystal mine to the north.By the Light, can you imagine how powerful that thing must be, to attract them all the way here from their spires?I suppose it is in their hands now... You'd have to be crazy to go looking for it..."
5197,Darkest Night : This keystone will grant its bearer entry into Anguish Fortress.Take it and meet Prophet Velen outside the Shadowmoon fortress.He intends to face Ner'zhul head-on.
5198,"Pressing the Attack : We got Gul'dan's minions on the run, commander! If you be feelin' it, we should put some pressure on some of his other strongholds as well."
5199,"A Song of Frost and Fire : You have rescued many of my clan from the slave pens of Tanaan. Their liberation and the destruction of the Dark Portal are more than enough for me to consider you one of us.However, you are still a stranger to our leader, Durotan. I would like to introduce you to him."
5200,"Forbidden Love : My son, Kral'za, is beyond stubborn. After we split from the Shadowmoon Clan he refused to let go of his relationship with a young Shadowmoon orc.I forbid him to see her anymore. He ran off earlier today and has not returned. I don't trust Dol'mak. Like the other Shadowmoon orcs she continues to dabble in the void."

It's positively brutal - and the crowd loves it!Come talk to me to start your first fight - beat four of the fiercest creatures I've got and you'll get a shot at the champ himself!-Gurgthock"
5202,
5203,
5204,
5205,"A Lesson in Archaeology : As an archaeologist, it's important to make great discoveries and contributions to the field. Why? Because that's how you make a name for yourself!Even that hack Harrison Jones has a somewhat reputable name. If he can do it, then you can too!The Highmaul are hiding something big in that cave of theirs and we need to get in there and take it!Take this teleportation beacon and make your way to the back of the cave. Once you find the relic, place the beacon and my team will take care of the rest!"
5206,"Defungination : Have you seen the fungus out there in the water? It's growing faster than a baby ravasaur from Un'goro, and if we don't get it under control, the Gearworks is gonna be ruined like our last village.Uncle Krixel used to tell me to burn away the red fungus because that's what makes it grow so fast.You could help us out by taking a flame blaster and clearing out some of those spores down in the shallows."
5207,I See Dead People : Th... they're ghosts! All of them!Bryan was one of my best friends. Something is clouding his mind; we need to snap him out of it and get to the bottom of this!He was always obsessed with his work. Maybe showing him one of his schematics would help. One of the spectral laborers might have one.
5208,
5209,"Infrastructure Improvements : <Sir/Ma'am>, we built a vehicle to take ya up to the Throne of Kil'jaeden but whenever we try a test flight the navigation system goes crazy!In my expert opinion it's 'cause of that crazy demon magic the Iron Horde is playing around with up there.  If you could travel up there and place these telemetry beacons we can program the vehicle and give you a stable flight all the way up.  Just be sure to have some friends with you, the demons up there look especially vicious!"
5210,"The Kaliri Whisperer : An important contact lives in the nearby Shadowglade. He is meek, but trains kaliri of monstrous size which are quite dangerous.He once claimed they could knock a rylak out of the sky, but I'll believe that when I see it.Skizzik is holding a valuable treasure for me.

""Don't forget to connect the sanctum to the ley line network!""Commander, I'm a foreman, not a mage. I... have absolutely no idea how to do that.We've found Archmage Khadgar and some other Kirin Tor not far from here. To the east, near the mountains. Perhaps we should ask them for a hand?"
5318,"Dream of Argus: The Final Fragment : The last orc to be found was a hermit who kept away from the bulk of the Shadowmoon orcs at the Pillars of Fate camp, but was often seen in the high hills above. The journal reads:  ""It is said, however, that he can often be seen among the graves upon the high hill, overlooking the camp below.  There he would commune with the dead ancestors, whom it is said he preferred over his living brethren."""
5319,"Shredder Manual : Hey! I hear there's a curious object nearby. Scouts say it's some kind of shredder manual.  Go check it out for me, will ya? I wonder if it has to do with this new prototype I've been hearin' about..."

We need to keep our cool and do this the right way.I have a plan - a scroll of mass teleportation.The fungal giants and shamblers down below are covered with pustules full of an oily substance. We can use the oil to craft a makeshift ink substitute for the scroll."

There's one problem, the concentrated fel energy up there is causing the navigation system to go haywire!  I'll need you to place some sensors along the edge of the summit. With them in place we can stabilize the flight controls.  Just be sure to have some friends with you, the demons up there look especially vicious!"
5324,"Destroying the Competition : One battle does not win the war, Commander.  That Transport isn't gonna hold up long against this Iron Horde navy.  We are going to need another ship.  Lucky for us, a local smuggler has supplied us with the plans we need to build Destroyers.  We should construct one of these ships immediately!"
5325,"Dream of Argus: The First Fragment : In his quest to restore the Dream of Argus, Maatun enlisted the help of three orcs. These same orcs betrayed him and took the crystal shards before they could be combined. If you find these orcs, they may still have them.  The first target shouldn't be far. The journal reads:  ""I was told she spent most of her time in the crystal cave to the north of the encampment. There she studied the native crystals for ways to improve their potential abilities."""
5326,"Talon Watch : By now you must be wondering about all of this curse business. What could distort a majestic arakkoa into... well, into this?<Reshad drags a crooked hand through the mottled feathers about his face.>A raven is prepped and waiting to fly you to Talon Watch.

5333,"Keeping it Together : So much work to do... I don't even know where to start.Making sure this garrison is operational is not an easy task.Shelly still hasn't reported back to me, my assistant Brightstone and her crew are who knows where, ugh... I'm so caught up I haven't even had time to check our cache for resources.If I were a mage, do you think I could use mirror images to do all of this at once?"
5334,"Shipbuilding : The first thing we need to start building ships is a blueprint. With your help, I grabbed some of the best ones from the Iron Docks before we broke out of there.Let's make sure these don't fall back into the hands of the Iron Horde. Memorize these blueprints, <class>, and then destroy the evidence. Let me know when you are done."

5338,"The Avatar of Terokk : My long sleep was disturbed by dreams of the past. I cut down my old enemies again. I watched my daughter die again.  You were there. I felt your presence in these dreams. And your past was revealed to me as well.  Someone has woven our fates together. My people are yours to protect, and your enemies are mine to destroy.

5339,"Tangleheart : Hey there, peach. We've got the lumber mill good and ready, but we gotta find a way of choppin' wood fast out here.  The Laughing Skull talked about Tangleheart, where the botani grow things quick as a quark.  I'm headin' there now."

5345,"Rescue Rangari : Many of our rangari have not been accounted for. It would seem the followers of Iyu have taken captives.We will continue to search the area for survivors.In the meantime, follow the Wildwood Wash west toward Highpass and look for any signs of our rangari comrades.Our people are stout and capable survivors. You may find more than you expect. Have them stay near the road and we will follow as soon as this... dwarf creature... has fixed his mechanical vessel."
5346,"Crippled Caravan : I'm getting reports that the botani have started leaving their bloom and attacking wandering travelers. This is most unusual.We already dispatched a number of rangari to try and resolve this issue.A caravan from Azeroth passed through here recently, you should probably check on your people to ensure their safety."

5348,"Gutrek's Cleaver: The Second Piece : The search for Gutrek's Cleaver continues. The journal reads:  ""The hilt was to be buried in the marshlands, among the serpents whose poison claimed Gutrek's life. There's something here about covering it with a spiral stone, which is supposed to keep Gutrek's spirit at bay somehow."""
5349,"Unknowable Power : The one they call Gul'dan has ruined his own people, and now seeks to ruin what remains of mine as well. The fallen outcasts at Kra'nak have already pledged themselves to Gul'dan in a false promise of a return to the skies. He has given the most powerful of his minions the power of the Apexis, but twisted in a way that I cannot explain. Bring one of these fragments to me."
5350,"A Charming Deception : Reshad is more than he appears; a mottled old crow with his beak in a book, certainly, but we need him.Shadows gather beneath the lonely spire, in Veil Terokk. Reshad must make it there safely.Along the path you'll find charms primed with illusion spells. You need only touch them to take on Reshad's image.Adherent assassins are on the prowl for an old outcast with scrolls on his back. They will fall upon you.Oh, but won't they be surprised when the illusion fades?! Kee-hee-hee!"

They named it Moira's Reach.But half way through buildin' it the base got infested with goren.If you head south you should come to the structure.

5354,"On the Offensive : We cannot enter these gates, but you can, <class>.Your mission is critical, and the Shadowmoon will kill you on sight. Do not hesitate to return the favor."
5355,Curing With Force : The infection is getting stronger so I made some adjustments and I'm pretty sure I have the right formula now.It should now work but it needs to have less competition with the infected blood for it to have any effect.This means you will need to weaken them before you apply the serum for it to function properly.The infection is getting more advanced and will soon be untreatable so we have this one shot to save as many as we can.
5356,"Call of the Talon King : $p, you have done much for my people. I wish to thank you on their behalf.  Please visit Veil Terokk when you can."
5357,"Grumpus : One of Draenor's oldest stories is the legend of Grumpus.The story tells of a mean-spirited brute that would come in the night, in the dead of winter, and kidnap children that misbehaved. Back at his lair, he would present them with awful toys, and use their tears to spawn his minions.But Grumpus is no legend, he's real and he's taken our children! Please, you have to slay him!"
5358,"Peace Offering : We need allies amongst these spires, and quickly. Commander, I believe it would be wise if you sought out aid.There is a lone arakkoa outcast southeast of here living near a ravager nest. The ravagers do not attack him - I suspect he has information on the beasts we may be able to use.I have our last crate of cactus apple surprise ready for you. It is our best shot, <sir/madame>."
5359,"A Rediscovered Legend : This Sparring Arena is a good start, but we will need trainers to help mold your forces into worthy fighters.There has been a reported spotting of a draenei to the west who matches the description of Akaani.This is interesting, as we all believed her dead. She was one of the finest warriors the draenei have ever fielded and a master of nearly any weapon forged or found.Commander, you could not ask for a more skilled trainer. I advise seeking her out, if it is really her..."

She is causing the ground to quake.<The farseer makes a sign of warding in the air, and then continues.>Perhaps those who have disturbed the great worm are the same ones your friends are tracking down?Either way, Shui Halad must be put to eternal rest before her thrashing collapses all of the north into the ocean."

5366,"Hidden in Plain Sight : <Reshad begins hastily stuffing scrolls into his robes.>I thought I would have more time to prepare! There are powerful relics hidden out there in Skettis - if I leave without them, I may as well have died.The first is a pair of wingblades being held by an effigy near the front gate. You likely walked right past them on your way in.Another effigy on the east side of the ruins bears a white mask over its face.Bring those relics to me, and their secrets shall be yours."
5367,"The Cure : Cowards! A curse on these wretched meatbags!The Bladespire have always taunted the orc clans by taking our wounded as slaves to fight like dogs in their pits.In retaliation for our assault they have poisoned their orc prisoners, leaving them to suffer and die an excruciating death.Only their geomancers carry the antidote, traveler. Use it to cure the Frostwolf prisoners."
5368,"Requisition a Riverbeast : I have seen great beasts floating slowly along the rivers of Talador. The 'riverbeasts,' I believe they are called.Their hides are solid, like rock, and yet they float along the waters easily. I would quite like to see one of these up close, if you should head that way. Tormak has created for you another rope, if you are interested."
5369,"Rendezvous with the Ritualists : Our dear brother Sekara went to the Ravenskar with some of the flock to enact the great ritual of purification.No one has been sent back to the nest for supplies in the past day; caught up in prayers I suppose.I would go check on him but I need to make sure the scribe didn't mess up her transcription of my latest sermon. Could you do it? I'll be there in... well, who knows..."
5370,"Sol Sisters : When I was still a guard in Skyreach, I was tasked with protecting the sisters Veoryx and Krashyx.They were prodigies. At an age when most sun acolytes could barely read, the sisters conjured familiars of pure sunlight to illuminate their textbooks in the small hours.Now they unravel the secrets of Apexis technology, and their excavation has just breached two ancient chambers.Enter those chambers and cut down the sisters before they reap the terrible rewards of their discovery."
5371,"My Precious! : You've got to help me!I was hiding on the trade wagon that got ambushed just down the road from here. I snuck away before the saberon spotted me...but...but...THEY STOLE MY MOST PRIZED POSSESSION!You've got to help me get it back! I watched them drag it into Sabermaw and up that giant hill!Who knows what those filthy saberon will do to it!Please, I'm just a kid! You've got to help me out, right?"

Return Karab'uun to me."
5376,"Into the Hollow : I've learned that the Shadow Council is using the nearby deathweb spiders' venom to spread fel corruption and augment their forces after their defeat at the Burning Front.One of my soulbinders saw a dreadlord headed into the eastern mines with Sha'tari, one of the remaining pieces of the Heart of Auchindoun.I need you to wrest Sha'tari from the dreadlord's quivering corpse and bring it to me, champion."
5377,"The Sting : The exarchs seem to trust you, <class>. Are you venturing into the Umbrafen?The Sporebats in this area are usually docile, but something's got them all riled up. When they attack, their stingers wrap around exposed limbs. I've seen them tear through reinforced leather like it was paper. How do they work, I wonder?Could you bring me a pristine sporebat stinger? I'd love to study it."
5378,"Beatface vs. Boulder : The saberon took their treasure up the rise and barricaded themselves in after Birchus attacked. It will be difficult to get in but I hear you have resources to handle this.One of their entrances is covered with a large boulder. Too large for you or I, but perhaps an ogre with a large enough hammer could break it. I think you know who I am talking about..."
5379,"A Message of Terrible Import : Your scout... he got me out of that hellish place. Fel orcs surprised us out in the jungle and dragged us up the mountain. They tortured us... killed all but me. I fear one of us may have given up our secret before the end.I must ask you to go to the home of our order. Speak with Lagar, my leader, tell him... tell him Gul'dan knows."
5380,Nemesis: Manslayer : <Raza'kul hands you the bloody heart.>The ritual is complete. Your nemesis is marked for death.Now your work to rid this world of the enemy truly begins. Kill all humans that stand defiantly against the Horde.

Fail and be nothing.
5381,"What Horrible Presents! : That mean old Grumpus has amassed a collection of odd gifts. He's deliberately trying to crush the spirit of children everywhere by giving out the worst presents imaginable.Take this spirit bomb. Toss it on some of Grumpus's unusual gifts and take them out for good!We're in this together, <name>. Now go and save the spirit of the holiday!"
5382,"Return to the Pack : Part of me agrees with Karg - we COULD challenge the Iron Wolf right now. My fists clench at the mention of his name. My muscles scream for vengeance.But then, in my heart, I feel Asha. Calming me. Guiding me. I do not deserve her wisdom, but it is a gift I will not waste.<Lokra squints at the sky.>Durotan and the others will be gathering at your garrison about now. We should meet them."
5383,Spore-be-Gone : We got an emergency!A bunch of spore drifters have infested the shore and tore up our Spore-B-Gone turrets.We're caught with our armor off here! If we don't get those turrets back online then those spores are going to float right in to town and then we'll have another Pinchwhistle Point on our hands!We need to get out there and manually activate them.Well? Are you in?

5389,"Banished From the Sky : The Adherents have been casting their enemies into the hollow for generations.The pools carry Sethe's dying curse, crippling arakkoa with visions of darkness and intense pain. The mind reels, the body writhes, and the wings wither.Most arakkoa die or go insane. Only the strongest can resist - seek them out and use the Eye of Anzu to help them to their senses.Beware, for the worshippers of Sethe also prey on these survivors to fill their ranks."
5390,"Easing into Lumberjacking : <Sir/Ma'am>, we're going to need a lot of lumber if we're going to build this garrison into a suitable fortress. That means we're going to have to do a little work.While I certainly wouldn't ask you to dirty your hands with manual labor, I do need you to go out and find timber for our mill. Once you mark a tree an able-bodied lazy-good-for-nothing peon will come and chop it down and give you the timber.Frostfire isn't the best place for timber, but I did see a suitable small tree nearby."
5391,"Retribution for the Light : There are agents of darkness everywhere, fighting tooth and nail to envelop the world. The Light relies on us to balance the scale.You have the power needed to destroy Teron'gor's demonic minions once and for all. Send them to the Twisting Nether in pieces!"
5392,"One Step Ahead : Boss, Durotan set off with Draka and Gazlowe to track da Iron Horde's movements along da coast.Dey waitin' for ya on the cliffs to da northwest."
5393,"Hatred Undying : The blood of the dead god, Sethe, lingers in the pools here. And with it, his hatred of Rukhmar and Anzu.So strong was this hate that it animates the blood even now, eons after he was slain by his fellow gods.I need the congealed blood that holds those spiteful creatures together.There is nothing the Adherents fear more than the power of this curse - what if we could brandish it against them?"
5394,
5395,"Gatekeepers of Auchindoun : Auchindoun is under attack, stranger, and I intend to help defend it.The only problem is the only armor I could find was my grandfather's old set, and it isn't nearly enough to defeat the spirits blocking the path toward Auchindoun.Would you defeat them and let me through the gate with you? I will find a way to repay you!"
5396,"The Silent Skull: The Second Reagent : The second ingredient to the elixir is a vine from the Bonethorn plant. The journal reads:  ""I must find a vine of bonethorn, which grows in the bones of the ancient dead. I remember seeing the bones of a long-dead beast in the dry beds of the northern wilds. Its sun-parched skull would make a pleasant home for such a plant."""
5397,"Ga'nar's Vengeance : My brother's head is as thick as his axe and he is as stubborn as a gronn.When Ga'nar left he took with him some of the finest warriors in the clan and headed north to the Daggermaw Ravine. If they are still out there, you must find them. Ga'nar will not listen to me.Help him see his vengeance through if you must but please bring him back to us."
5398,Removing the Reinforcements : My own investigations have uncovered a permanent arcane portal from here to Highmaul itself.It is guarded but shouldn't be too hard to disrupt once you've gotten some breathing room.
5399,"Nazgrel : Escaping Stonemaul was the easy part. The ogre filth that rule the pits still have my son.For a while they used him as leverage to ensure I would fight in their arenas. But now that I have escaped they will try to train him to replace me.Please, rescue my son. If they see me they will kill him instantly."
5400,"A Sentimental Relic : My father's bangle sat here for ages before that imposter Ikiss stole it away.I thank you for returning it, but I have no need for keepsakes. Take it, with my blessing.If there are still Talonpriests loyal to the true Talon King, please bring it to them."
5401,"Zero Xuks Given : The spirits have spoken to me. They believe the magnaron, Gro the Uncreator, will join our fight and lead his underlings against the Iron Horde.This is an honor beyond any bestowed upon a Laughing Skull, at least in my time.I will commune with the magnaron, and together we shall destroy the Iron Horde."
5402,"A Parting Favor : I don't know what happened. My crew and I must have been the first to fall.My wife, the innkeeper, is in the same stupor you found me in. I can feel it... and there are others with her.Please, give the townsfolk peace and show their essences to my wife. That should bring her back from that cold abyss."
5403,"Hataaru, the Artificer : I will also need you to call upon Exarch Hataaru. I understand you were helping him with our defenses at the gate.Hataaru is our Chief Artificer - he understands our technology better than any other and has been working tirelessly to recreate the glory of the civilization we left behind.He has moved to his workstation outside of the Elodor Dig, our crystal mines located just to the Southeast. Look for him at the mine entrance."
5404,
5405,A Green Ogron? : Kaz always told me green ogron are bad.The botani here have a green ogron and it is mean.It was strong enough to take out my dad's entire hunting party.Are you strong enough to kill it?

A windrider be waitin' to catch ya up with the latest caravan shipment whenever you be ready, <sir/ma'am>.  -- Rokhan"
5407,"Deeds Left Undone : In his haste, Ga'nar advanced before this area was secured. He is a matchless warrior, mind you, but his tactics are sometimes costly.Gol'kosh and his troops were ordered to destroy enemy supplies, but ogres have stolen the oil he needs.Retrieve the oil and see that their mission is carried out, traveler. Then, if they still live, direct them to rejoin me at the citadel's entrance.I must see my wounded brothers to safety."
5408,Moving In : Gorr'thog is now dead. It is time now to secure our hold on Bladespire Citadel. Meet me below and we can begin strengthening our presence.

We do it together."
5410,"The Farseer : The Thunderlord warleader... <name>, you have to stop him.He went to attack Drek'Thar at the Pool of Visions to the northwest!"
5411,"All Due Respect : A group of Adherents came 'round just before the attack on Skettis. Disguised myself as a mushroom, I did. The fools walked right past me.My neighbor up the road was not so lucky.He had a fondness for texts, if I recall. Might be valuable information in his hut, if you give Reshad a moment to rummage around.Oh, and bring one of his feathers to the shrine near Veil Terokk, would you? He was such a dear, and I know it's what he'd want."
5412,"The Silent Skull: The Third Reagent : The final component of the elixir is a handful of Steamcap mushrooms. The journal reads:  ""The Crowfeeder said that they grow among the steam vents in the higher parts of the Everbloom. I have seen one such place above the northern hydra pools."""
5413,Heart of the Fen : The pounding in my head is almost unbearable but I must see this through. With all the spore samples I've taken I know where to go and what to do.I will find the source and spread... no! Destroy it! I will do what needs to be done!
5414,"Fair Warning : The ogron here are far from brilliant, but they are more intelligent than the gronn. They're large, and even stronger than they look.Their leader, Borogahn, is especially formidable. Despite several fights, I have not yet managed to kill him.Heed my words, friend. Take caution as you explore their lair.Nisha is ready to move. Ask her to take you to the mouth of the cave, and I'm sure she would be happy to."
5415,"Vol. X Pages ? : That shredder had a manual jammed in the cockpit, but it's missing a lot o' pages. If we can find those manual pages, I'd bet my third toe I can get the prototype shredder working again.  I coulda swore I saw a few of those pages floatin' about in  Archenon Siegeyard. Maybe the orcs there carry them."
5416,"Power Unearthed : What power could reduce a village to ashes in the blink of an eye? The Adherents claim it is the will of Rukhmar.A lie, obviously.They did nothing to earn such power - in truth, they stumbled upon it rather unwittingly, in a hole in the ground.Come and visit me near the excavation site just west of here. We must understand their technology if we are to defeat it."
5417,"Gas Guzzlers : <Sir/Ma'am>, to make the best equipment for your arsenal I need not only the best materials, but to use the best techniques.Over the years I've developed a method to greatly strengthen my metal, but it does require an exotic resource: goren gut gas!The nearby mine at Kuuro's Claim just came down with an infestation of the things. Could you collect a few samples for the arsenal supplies? Just kill a few goren and give their bodies a good prod with this gas extractor."
5418,
5419,"Honor Has Its Rewards : You have honored my people. Now, we wish to honor you.We have a rite of initiation in my clan. When one comes of age, they cover themselves in the blood of their first hunt, and rest their hands upon a shamanstone to honor the ancestors who came before them.In our brief time together you have already slain many foes more fierce than our hunters have ever had to face. Go, touch the shamanstone here in Wor'gol, and join our pack as an equal."
5420,"Nisha's Vengeance : Since I left on my last hunt, the Iron Horde have drawn nearer and reinforced their positions.<A grin spreads across Rexxar's lips.>They've created a target-rich environment.I must continue nursing Nisha to health for now. You go in my stead, friend. Fill them with the fear and pain that they inflicted on her.Make their screams fill the canyon!"
5421,"Commander in the Field! : This battle will be won, but it will be hard fought. Our rangari did manage to get a few scouts out to the rest of the jungle though.Perhaps it is best you collect this intelligence yourself and see what this jungle holds for us all."
5422,"The Critical Path : The auburn forests of Talador sit at a critical crossroads of this continent, commander. The Iron Horde's fleet is already en route from Gorgrond to Shattrath on the west coast.Talador will fall if we don't reinforce them. I took the liberty of dispatching Foreman Eksos, who has already begun construction on an outpost for your forces not far from the Iron Horde landing point. He awaits your orders sir."
5423,Trophy of Glory: Roardan the Sky Terror : Defeating Roardan has yielded you a trophy worthy of acclaim.Take this to Maraad at Highpass.
5424,"Arcane Essence : Kaelynara's lust for arcane power has consumed her and she threatens the safety of all in this mine. She must be stopped.Unfortunately, there is nothing we can do while she shields herself. We will need to find a way to penetrate her shielding spell.Perhaps if I were to build a focusing crystal, I could use it to lower her shield...I'll need you to search the crystal mine for the necessary components.First, I'll need arcane essence from the Crystal Ragers and Arcane Wraiths in the mine."
5425,"Burning Beauty : Before you go, there is someone you should meet.She might set some of your stuff on fire, but I believe she's the best mage this side of Draenor.She belongs on the front lines with you, commander."
5426,Captured Critters : This poor critter is about to be podling food. It would be pretty easy to set this little guy free.
5427,Engineering Her Demise : -- THE MOTHER HAS BEEN DETECTED. WARNING! WARNING! --
5428,"Exarch Maladaar : The council is almost assembled: Othaar, myself, Hataaru and Naielle are ready. Only Exarch Maladaar remains. He has not been himself since he returned from his capture at the hands of the Iron Horde... but Vindicator Maraad was able to track him down.Find Maladaar at the Fey Landing, just south of the town center."
5429,"Befriending the Locals : We need allies desperately if we want a chance at surviving until tomorrow. We've made contact with one of the outcast arakkoa, but he refused to discuss alliances without speaking to you first.He called himself Dusk-Seer Irrizar. You should speak with him, commander.You can find him just southwest of Veil Terokk."
5430,
5431,Words of the Raven Mother : We came here to perform the ritual of calling to bring the return of the Raven Mother. We had distributed parts of the scroll to everyone and had just begun when we were attacked by the Bloodmane. Now most of the flock has been killed and fragments lay scattered across our homeland.The ritual was a failure but we will not allow these mongrels to break our faith. We must continue our prayers here but we would be grateful if you can recover the scroll fragments for us.
5432,"Just In Case : When we set up shop the first thing we built was the cannon. Seemed like a good place fer it.We started buildin' the base up around it when them chompin' acid spittin' varmints came crawlin' out of the ground.The upside though is the cannon is built, just not loaded.We have to go down to the bottom floor of this thing anyway so may as well grab some Doomshot if you see any on your way down.Better to load the cannon and not need it than to need it and not have it loaded."
5433,"Taming a Talbuk : If we're going to start sending out patrols in this wilderness, we'll need swift mounts for our troops. We can capture young beasts and bring them back here for training, eventually turning them into formidable beasts of war.The talbuk is one of Draenor's fastest creatures, and that makes them just that much more difficult to capture. Take this talbuk lasso and head out to Shadowmoon Valley. Mount up and rope one of the young talbuk, and follow it until it's tamed. Don't let it get too far from you!"
5434,"The Eldest : There is Hatock, last and eldest son of the Iron Wolf. One of the greatest hunters the Thunderlord have ever fielded.He was there when his father murdered my father and left me for dead.When I am done with him he will regret not finishing the job."
5435,"The Strength of Our Bonds : Asha has passed, but we share a bond that cannot be severed by death. Even now, her spirit urges me onward to Grom'gar.The Iron Wolf claims our attachments make us weak... that love makes us vulnerable.He is wrong.Karg is my strength, and I his. I will free him from his chains, and together we will show the Thunderlord clan the strength of our bonds."
5436,"Botani Beatdown : Gidwin is doing much better. Thank you, <name>.I can't believe the draenei have lived alongside those horrible monsters for so long.Maybe we should show these beasts what happens when you mess with an Azerothian."
5437,"Sunsworn Camp : We no longer have a need to work alongside the Auchenai, champion. I have arranged for their lead soulbinders to continue to advise us, but I believe any action is best left to us at this point.Meet me at Sunsworn Camp, southeast of here. I can sense more demonic taint in the area, and we may be able to track down the remaining power crystal shards at its source."
5438,"Amulet of Rukhmar: The Final Key : One last key is required to access the Apexis device. The writings pertaining to its location read:  ""The final key has been housed deep within the fungal caves where the river makes its final drop. Though the pale orcs that dwell there may be vile, they should prove a worthy deterrent."""
5439,"Wolf Training: The Garn : I've got one last challenge for ye, commander, but if it isn't a doozy.They call them the garn. Wolves as black as night, and twice the size of a normal wolf, they can tear a man apart in seconds. Any beast in their right mind would be scared witless at the sight of such a predator.There's a lone garn that's made it from their usual home in Frostfire, all the way over to Nagrand. Take your wolf, mount up, and bring it down. If the two of you survive, your wolf will truly be ready."
5440,Assault on the Ruins of Kra'nak : The Shadow Council have recruited the Sethekk and other power hungry Arakkoa to their service. Our allies in the Order of the Awakened have tracked them to a ruin in the west of Tanaan where the Shadow Council is instructing them in the use of fel magic.  We must strike at them before they can master their diabolic powers.
5441,"Making Acquaintances : It's nice to see someone else taking a vested interest in the arcane arts, you know. It's all too rare these days if you ask me.Unfortunately, I must meet Cordana to handle an important matter, but we're in luck! One of my good friends in the Kirin Tor has agreed to help you connect your arcane sanctum to the ley line network.She's waiting at my tower. Let's leave immediately and introduce you to one another."
5442,"Cleaning Up Gul'var : Khadgar wants you to concentrate on Gul'dan, but that doesn't mean we're not going to take down the Shadow Council in the process.Gul'var's filthy with Shadow Council villains. Let's do something about them."
5443,"The Purge of Veil Shadar : Not all arakkoa are alike.<Iskar lifts his sleeve to reveal a mangled, useless wing.>It is no illusion. They did this to me. Before I was even given a name, I was given a place in society: at the bottom.We are many. We make our homes in the places this world has forgotten.Veil Shadar was such a place, but the Adherents have found it and started a purge. For morale. For fun.Help my people escape, and we'll be in your debt.When the sky burns, it pays to have allies in the shadows."
5444,"Inspecting the Troops : Southport lies not far from here to the southwest.No time for chit-chat. I will meet you there, commander."
5445,"Trouble at the Overwatch : Yesterday, I sent two of my best scouts to spy on the ogres at Mar'gok's Overwatch.I haven't heard back from them.<name>, would you do me the honor of checking on them? I'm sure it's nothing; the Overwatch is a large fortification.I'd feel better knowing they're okay."
5446,"What's Under There? : It is done.With this enchantment, not only can you roam amongst the goren freely, but you can move as they do.Your travels through the canyon are now made easier. You have safe access to places otherwise impossible to reach.Perhaps these tunnels will lead to more information that could be used against the Iron Horde."
5447,"Talbuk Training: Great-Tusk : The talbuk is ready for more training, and for this, we will return to its home in Shadowmoon Valley.One of the great beasts of this land, Great-Tusk, has taken the valley for his own. Pit your beast against him in combat, and if you should survive, it will have greater confidence in its own abilities."
5448,"Bring the Reinforcements : Greetings, Commander! With all of the fighting concentrated here in Tanaan, we've got the breathing room to divert some of our resources from nearby outposts to help make headway.Just let me know which reinforcements to call, and I'll get them here on the double!"
5449,"A Proper Parting : The ogres outnumbered us, *cough* but we made them pay for their deeds in blood.Even so, I was forced to abandon my fallen brothers and sisters on the battlefield. They deserve better than to have their corpses despoiled by the ogre filth.Here, take this torch *cough* and do what I could not: burn the corpses of my fallen brothers and sisters to the west."
5450,"Earth, Wind and Fire...and Water : The Elemental Plateau has become unstable, and so the cycle of rebirth must begin.It is a natural part of our life cycle that impurities are accumulated in the elemental body over time.When enough contamination has taken place, an elemental will become unstable and in some cases volatile.A necessary part of rebirth is pure, living essence which can be found atop the Elemental Plateau, as well as in the body of an elemental spirit.Return to me with the essence and we shall begin the rebirth."
5451,"Clearing Out Before Cleaning Up : Here's the situation.We need to get this salvage operation moving ASAP, but the ship went down right in the middle of the wasp nests.The ugly bugs are all over the place, and I can't call my team in here to start work until they're taken care of.Go kill as many of 'em as you can and I'll cut you in on some of the haul."
5452,"Trouble to the South : A group of Alliance soldiers headed south from here not long ago. They said they were searching for some sort of special flower.To be frank, I'm concerned for their safety. This area is still crawling with Iron Horde.They could surely use your help if you're able. Follow the road south and you should find their position."
5453,"Feeding An Army : We've had a chance to work with these beasts for a while now, and that's allowed us to develop a brand-new trap for you to try out. It should be much sturdier than the last one.The Improved Iron Trap will let you capture some of the meatiest beasts on Draenor. You will find that a single riverbeast or boar from Gorgrond can feed many warriors.Trap one and bring it back, and we will cook you a savage meal."
5454,"Bleeding the Bleeding Hollow : The Bleeding Hollow provide significant reinforcement to the Iron Horde in Tanaan. From their home in Zeth'Gol they relentlessly pursue our scouts, disrupt our operations, and gather more power for Gul'dan's magic.  We should consider a direct raid on Zeth'Gol to make them pull back their forces across the valley. This should give us some breathing room... for a time."
5455,"Nemesis: Becoming Death : You have chosen your quarry and surely soon they will feel your merciless wrath, but first you must venture out into the wilds of Draenor and rip out the still-beating heart of a draenei in mortal combat. Return here with your prize.Through the heart of your enemy the spirits will attune your senses, granting you second sight and keenness in hearing - all to stalk your prey and claim dominance."
5456,"Sons of Sethe : Many years have passed since anyone has been in contact with Anzu. He faded away, as Terokk did, to take refuge in the shadows.If we are to coax him back, we should make an offering.Sethe took the sky from us all - it seems fitting to take the wings of his children."
5457,"Best Deals Anywhere : Commander, two goblin smugglers - Mixxy and Trixxy Weldblast - came through here recently and went off towards the bog to the east.They had drilling equipment but weren't carrying any weapons, <sir/madame>.I'd bet anything that they'll have materials we'd want, and that they could use some protection in return.Commander, I think seeking them out would be a good idea."
5458,"If At First You Fail, Try Again! : Looks like that Submarine had a bit more firepower than we thought!  They used First Strike to hit us before we even saw it coming.  Losing ships is a part of naval battles, Commander.  Luckily, we were prepared for this exact sort of situation.  Speak with Solog down at the dry docks, he should be able to help us quickly produce another Destroyer.  Head back here when the ship is complete, we will have a new mission ready for you."
5459,"Only the Winner : I am Gronnstalker Rokash, and I only serve the winning side.I have heard of some of your deeds, commander, and seen the corpses left in the wake of you and your forces.I have grown tired of my current clan. They are soft, weak, and losing.I offer you this challenge: enter Colossal's Fall to the north and slay Sky-Singer Strag. Claim her totem as a trophy and I will hail you as my new chieftain."
5460,"Gazmolf Futzwangler and the Highmaul Crusade : I'm here in Nagrand recruiting for the Steamwheedle Preservation Society. We're the archaeological branch of the Steamwheedle Cartel.We're here to collect all of the artifacts, relics, antiquities and oddities that Nagrand has to offer! Currently, we're hiring surveyors, excavators, adventurers... you name it!If you're interested in getting your hands dirty, talk to Gazmolf Futzwangler over at Stonecrag Gorge. He's the goblin in charge of this expedition!"
5461,"An'dure The Giant : In order to break through Kaelynara's arcane shield, we will need a focusing crystal of rare power and quality.Within the mine is a crystal giant known to the Draenei as An'dure. The giant has slept far beneath the earth for ages, but due to Kaelynara's recklessness it has awakened.The heart of a crystal giant is a truly powerful artifact. Defeat An'Dure and return to me with a crystal giant heart.When you return I will construct the focusing crystal and together we will stop Kaelynara."
5462,"Not In Your Army : Your men caught one of da new recruits,  talking with da alliance behind your back. She be a traitor, boss-mon! She be a danger to everything you've worked so hard for.We have a wyvern ready to be takin' her to your garrison for proper punishment. I thought you would be wantin' to deal with da scoundrel personally.I last be seein' her on the back road out of Axefall."
5463,"Lost Lumberjack : Me friend was in the mole machine wit' me. Good ol' Frenna tried to make the best of it by writin' all o' her observations down in a journal.Penny here wants me to tell ya where she is. I cannae say for sure, but she was followin' me outta here and I don't think she made it."
5464,"In Ared's Memory : My master has gone on to the Light, but I will continue his work.<Miall looks to Ared >Shanai ortar, Ared.I will have his body sent to Auchindoun. For now, show me this artillery tower of yours."
5465,"Blades in the Dark : Those orcs got hold of Ishaal's orb, did they? That would explain the dangerous-looking fellow who crossed into this realm shortly before you.Not everyone handles the transition as... gracefully as you did. The oaf is still grappling with his own mind, stumbling about and muttering nonsense.Soon he will be drawn to the orb again, which would presumably lead him to Veil Terokk.Better to take him out now while he's still befuddled."
5466,"The Master Siegesmith : Not long ago, the most advanced weapon a Thunderlord could make was a really, really big spear. The Blackrock orcs must have shipped in a fearsome master to have them producing cannons so rapidly.We need to find that master."
5467,"Leave Every Soldier Behind : The ogron possess something of value to the Iron Horde. I am sure they're unaware, likely just bored and in need of something to torture.We could simply leave them to their fate, but we should follow up on this clue. With any luck, it will help us stop the Iron Horde from turning Gorgrond's most fearsome creatures into weapons.Try to find Corporal Thukmar and his notes."
5468,"Shrouding Stones : Long ago, the shaman of the Shadowmoon clan erected three stones in the woods. There, they performed their sacred rituals, blessing the beasts and the trees.Now, someone has placed a fel magic upon those stones. This corruption is what shrouds the village of Gul'var.Before we can use the captured demon to safely peer into the Shadow Council's village, we must bring down those stones."
5469,
5470,"Of Wolves and Warriors : The return of many of my people is a boon to us, and I thank you for your part in their survival.  Come, ride with me. We have much to discuss."
5471,Proof of Strength: Ravager Claw : This claw is proof of your strength at slaying ancients and your gladiator friend has born witness!Take the claw back to Limbflayer and claim your accolades!
5472,Laying Dionor to Rest : You have given me a tremendous gift with this bloom. I can finally send Dionor back to the Overgrowth for good and end this nightmare. All that remains is the ritual... stay and behold something you will never see again in your lifetime...
5473,
5474,"Echoes of the Past : When a spirit is consumed by the void, an echo of the soul is all that is left behind.Neither in the physical or spiritual sense of the word would these echoes be considered 'alive.' The echo is merely a twisted reverberation of the anguish left behind by the soul as it is consumed.If left unchecked, the echoes will lash out against the living and stir the spirits of the dead from their graves.In order to restore peace to the Ancestral Grounds, these echoes must be put to rest."
5475,"Where's My Wolf?! : My frost wolf, Nerok, was captured with me and the others. I do not know where they are keeping him, but I'll bet the so-called ""beastmaster"" who dragged us here does.He is at the beast pens nearby, boasting about his catch to the younger hunters.We'll see how he boasts with my axe in his skull."
5476,"The Exarch Council : Good work at the gates! The Shadowmoon orcs have been seeking prisoners for some reason. Their aggression helps our cause.Come with me. I would like to introduce you to the Exarch Council, ""The Hand of the Prophet."" I have been trying to convince the Exarchs to support our cause and go on the offensive against the Iron Horde, but they are - as always - too cautious and slow to act.Come with me, I will introduce you to Exarch Othaar up the hill. Perhaps meeting an Alliance hero can sway the council."
5477,"Amulet of Rukhmar: The Apexis Device : Now that the keys have been activated, the Apexis device that leads to the amulet should be accessible.   The Arakkoa research states that it is likely located in Lost Veil Anzu, within the ""shrine to the raven god."""
5478,"Talbuk Training: The Garn : The last test for your mount will pit it against one of the great terrors of this land.The garn. Wolves as black as night, and twice the size of a normal wolf, they can tear an orc apart in mere moments. The beasts here wisely fear them.There is a lone garn that calls Nagrand its home. Take your talbuk, mount up, and bring it down. If the two of you survive, your talbuk will truly be ready for war."
5479,"He Drew Aggro...culture : What you saw was the wake of the genesaur, Iyu. It was chasing this mechanical monstrosity and the person who drove it.I believe the pilot of this vessel is still alive and trapped within the ruins of the camp.If you wish them to be recovered, I recommend doing so now."
5480,A Little Wetwork : The shattered remnants of the Iron Horde pour into Tanaan through Ironhold Harbor. If we knew more about their fleet we could dispatch countermeasures from your shipyard in Shadowmoon.Perhaps you could gather some naval intelligence for our cause?
5481,"Hardly Working : Those who were not incinerated at Veil Akraz are forced to help the Adherents excavate the very weapons aimed at their heads.Anyone trying to escape is vaporized by the overseer's Apexis turret.With these effigies, they won't know anyone has left! Place one near an enslaved worker and observe as it creates a perfect copy. It even cloaks the subject in shadow, so they can slip away safely!"
5482,"Bushwhacker : Kaz is using us, I am sure of it. She is a Laughing Skull and must NOT be trusted.For now, I am willing to play along until we can learn more. Kaz is going to ask for you to travel to Evermorn Springs. When there, I recommend you slay any botani you encounter.Culling the numbers of these horrific casters will hopefully save future orcs from such a infested fate.I will stay with Kaz and keep a close eye on her."
5483,We Burn the Dead : I saw lots of bodies here. Kaz always said to burn the bodies.That way they can't come back as the mean greens.We should burn the bodies.
5484,
5485,"To Capture Gul'dan : Gul'dan is in the cave further into the Gloomspire.We know that he's about to leave for Talador and Shadowmoon Valley. You must capture him by any means necessary, <name>.I'll see you back at Throm'var. Good luck."
5486,"WANTED: Maa'run's Hoof : Posted by: OrrinA wild talbuk called ""Maa'run"" wanders the hills southeast of Embaari Village and west of The Draakorium.My brother was injured by this foul beast, and now lays in recovery.For the safety of all the nearby villages, we must put an end to this vicious, rampaging creature!A handsome reward will be given to anyone who can bring me his hoof as proof of his demise."
5487,"Extrinsic Motivation : The Shattered Hand aren't strangers to pain. They each cut off their own hand as a sign of their allegiance to Kargath.If you're going to get them to talk, it might take more than my poison.Slaughter them all. We'll see how far they're willing to go for their beloved warlord."
5488,"Into the Heart of Madness : <name>, Nyami ran off to 'take down Teron'gor herself.'You need to find her. She has no chance against him on her own.I must remain here and organize our ranks should another attack fall upon us. I'm counting on you."
5489,"Fun with Fungus : It is our mission as rangari to explore and understand this world. Around you is the Umberfen. Many draenei lost their lives when we first discovered this place. The volatile spores burst whenever anyone approaches.But we watched... and we learned.Around the swamp you'll notice ""Shimmershrooms,"" distinguished by their orange glowcaps. Their dust will make you invisible to the volatile spores. Grab the spores - gently! - and bring them to me.We will forge this savage world into a weapon."
5490,
5491,Reglakk's Research : These ogres have been using ancient Titan artifacts to empower a small cadre of specialized units called the Breakers. This Magister Reglakk is here studying ways to improve the process.Let's put a stop to whatever rituals he has going up on the bluff.
5492,"The Crone : Do you remember our greeting, $p?""Shadows gather when the raven swallows the day.""It is more than an old verse - it is a call to action. Followers of the old ways are gathering, and I must join them. You are needed, too, I should thinkFollow this road down to Crow's Crook. There you will find the home of an old crone. Greet her as you greeted me, and she will guide the way.You will not see me, but I will be close behind."
5493,"The Bloodmane : We had just arrived and begun the service of the headless fowl when the Bloodmane attacked out of nowhere.Clearly, this means that the Raven Mother wishes to test the worthiness of her children. Fear not, we are steadfast and will fervently continue our prayers regardless of what may come!<Sekara leans in and whispers to you.>Although, if you can get rid of the Bloodmane and their leader that would be a blessing as well."
5494,"Dark Iron Down : While you were away our rangari here found more clues leadin' to some of me other friends.Burrian Coalpart and Scorchbrow.Problem is, their trail heads right for Evermorn Springs to the west.Please Commander, will ya get in there and save them from mulching?"
5495,"Assassin's Mark : We need tae find the orc responsible fer makin' the poison tae make an antidote.Master assassins always leave their mark somewhere on one o' their kills. It's a claim tae fame o' sorts. An' trust me, this was the work of a master assassin.Let's split up and see if we can find some sign on one o' the outcast corpses that will lead us tae their killer. I'll meet ye at the bottom o' the hill, commander."
5496,"Unleashed Steel : Thank you... boss.I won't let you down! I didn't even try to sneak one of those low quality blades here that one of your peons placed right next to the cage. Which by the way was a pretty terrible idea and that thing should be moved before you get anyone less honorable in here.Enough talk, lets check this place out!"
5497,"Up and Running : The Warsong struck us hard. We lost Telaar, but we have a rare opportunity to strike at the heart of the Warsong.We need your wisdom and leadership to pull it off, <name>.First though, we're going to get our survivors out of Telaar. My rangari are ready to strike. We just need to get you to them.Thaelin has a copter that can get you to them. Unfortunately, his hands are full just trying to keep the infernal thing running.Help him get it up and running?"
5498,"More Lazy Peons : We have a rare opportunity to strike at the heart of the Warsong. But, we need your wisdom and leadership.The most important decision will be your choice between building a corral or a tankworks. This choice will setup our approach to the fight against the Warsong.Thazz'ril will head up our building efforts. Will you give him a hand?It looks like he's having trouble motivating his peons to work."
5499,"Lost Mole Machines : Few people know the Blackrock clan better than Dark Iron dwarves.So after Tanaan, we sent a bunch of mole machines to Gorgrond to build a listenin' post to keep an eye on them.Me own mole machine got way off course an' I got separated. It didn't take long to figure out all the other mole machines got off course as well.Accordin' to the readin's in me tank, a mole machine surfaced somewhere way to the west of here.Mind scoutin' ahead while we get this tank operational?"
5500,"Coalpart's Revenge : I'm so full I can't swing an axe even if I had one.Tell ya what, we got a mutual interest here. I need yer help to get a little vengeance on the big botani at the back of this bloom. In return, I'll point ya in the right direction fer gettin' a secret weapon the botani keep."
5501,"All Natural : Oh, you have a trading post?Fantastic!Let's make a deal. You help me power up my laser cannon, and I'll trade some of this... thermo... ultra... obsidiglass with you for some weapons.The ancients all around here are practically made of charcoal after the arakkoa weapon hit, you should go get some of that!"
5502,"Frenzied Manafeeders : There is a rare breed of moth in Talador known as the Manafeeder. These moths sustain themselves by feeding on arcane crystal dust from the mine.Typically speaking, these moths are nothing more than an occasional nuisance. However, they are now gorging themselves upon the intense arcane energy flooding out of the mine and have become highly territorial and aggressive.I have attuned this crystal to disperse arcane energy. Please use it on the Frenzied Manafeeders to soothe them."
5503,Nemesis: Troll Hunter : <Kuros hands you the bloody heart.>The ritual is complete. Your nemesis is marked for death.Now your work to rid this world of the enemy truly begins. Kill all trolls that stand defiantly against the Alliance. Let their deaths serve as a warning to the rest of the Horde: they will leave Draenor or they will die.Return when you have quenched your rage with the blood of troll.Conquer our enemy and be known as troll hunter. Fail and be nothing.
5504,
5505,"Goren, Goren, Gone! : We... we left the goren alone for too long. They have grown bold and forgotten who we are.Kill them! Kill them all. Rip them apart until they scream. Remind them what happens to anyone who tries to attack a Laughing Skull village.Oh, and welcome to Gorgrond."
5506,"Adherents of the Sun God : The arakkoa from Skyreach are all ruled by the Adherents of Rukhmar. They revile those of us who bear the Curse of Sethe, and decree that we must be purged in the name of their sun god.Soon their gaze will turn to lands beyond Arak.Challenge their warriors. Buy me time to prepare my escape, and help me set into motion their downfall."
5507,Down the Goren Hole : Dwarves are dumb. Don't they know that if you dig a deep hole you are going to have goren attack?If you are going to go into that iron fort you better kill a bunch of goren otherwise they are going to chew the walls enough to cause a cave-in.I would do it myself but I'm still stuffed from all that fruit the botani made me eat.
5508,"A Grim Harvest : The spores grow thick further into the marsh, but those larger fungus beasts are the key.Yes, kill them and take their spore sacs. I will need them to refine my... search."
5509,"Rage and Wisdom : Beasts of the western wasteland fight an endless war with the creatures of the eastern wilds.If one side were to overwhelm the other, all of Draenor would be doomed at the hand of the victor.The Laughing Skull seek revenge for their destroyed village. I have directed them to aim their vengeance at the nearby creatures, that our outpost here might be preserved.If you would, commander, oversee their efforts. I have not yet grown to trust the Laughing Skull."
5510,Assault on Ironhold Harbor : The Iron Horde continue to bring in reinforcements from all over Draenor to reinforce their position at Hellfire Citadel. If we don't cut off the flow of supplies then we risk losing control of our plans in Tanaan.  A strategic attack to the supply lines at Ironhold Harbor is just the thing to keep the Iron Horde on the defensive and maintain our momentum.
5511,"The Life Spring : It sounds like these... ""dwarves""... you found managed to steal a powerful botani artifact.But the fools didn't know they need a special water to power it.To the north is a well along the Evermorn Rise.There you will find a guardian, a creature of water we have named Utrophis.Slay it and take its essence and you will be one step closer to claiming the power of the botani and their genesaur."
5512,"Harbingers of the Void : Our scouts have made a horrifying discovery, <name>.The souls of the prisoners are being used to summon creatures from the void.Inside, three beings of darkness already await - the Essence of Shadow, the Essence of Darkness, and the Essence of Anguish.They must be destroyed immediately, before their power can be unleashed."
5513,"For the Horde! : Without you, none of us would have made it to the shores of my homeland. You will be the one to lead our forces here on Draenor. This is your garrison to found.  I leave it to you to plant the banner and claim this territory. When you are ready, I will have Khadgar open a portal to bring through a few necessary reinforcements."
5514,"A Gronnling Problem : It's gonna be quite a task to build you a fortress if there's gronnlings rampaging around.  I don't think anyone else here can handle taking those big beasts out, so you might need to take care of it yourself."
5515,
5516,"The Lady of Light : <name>, yes? You are the one in charge here? I am Knight-Lord Dranarus, at your service.Lady Liadrin has responded to a suspected demon presence near Auchindoun, southwest of here. She has asked specifically for your assistance in ensuring Auchindoun does not fall into Gul'dan's hands.If you could set forth at your nearest convenience, I am sure the Lady would be most grateful."
5517,
5518,Resources in Ashran : Bodrick has mentioned to me that you have acquired some interesting construction notes in your forays out there. A construction guide or assembly notes perhaps?You should speak with Kinkade Jacobs in Stormshield. She is willing to exchange finished blueprints for such things.
5519,Into the Boneslag : The Thunderlords took prisoners into the Boneslag?Well what are we waiting for?! We have to go after them!You look for the missing villagers - Asha and I will track Karg.
5520,"New Babies : That's better, but there's still something wrong. I'm getting desperate here, <name>.Can I call ya, <name>? Great.Look, I think I have it now. I know what's wrong.They miss their babies.Yeah! When they first came here, the, uh... the bastard hunters that... abandoned them said they left the babies behind.If we're going to save them from a life of misery, if we're going to save those babies, <under his breath> and turn a tidy profit, we've got to get them some new babies!"
5521,"Xuk It! : It is done.With this enchantment, not only can you roam amongst the goren freely, but you can move as they do.Your travels through Gorgrond are now made simple. You have safe access to places otherwise impossible to reach.Xuk's ancestors have made it so."
5522,"Swamplighter Queen : It looks like those plant creatures used some kind of poison when they attacked Gidwin.It's a powerful concoction to say the least.If we are going to cure Gidwin we need one more special ingredient. This one might be a bit harder to obtain than the others.You up to the challenge, <name>?"
5523,"Naielle, The Rangari : I am calling the Exarch Council to order to hear your petition. None of us doubt that this ""Iron Horde"" is a threat, but few can agree on what we should do about it. It is up to you and Vindicator Maraad to gather the Exarchs together.Exarch Naielle is the leader of the Rangari, the ""Eyes of the Prophet."" They are our scouts who silently stalk the farthest corners of Draenor. Seek her out in the Rangari Enclave northwest of here."
5524,"Lunarblossom : How I long to hold Kat'la.No star or moon can compare to her beauty.Alas, I am but a simple boar farmer.If only I could find time to sneak away from this pathetic excuse for a job and pick some lunarblossoms for Kat'la.I wouldn't dare confess my love to her without a gift."
5525,"Inspiring Ashran : I hope you will find our facilities to be up to your high standards.This inn is run by Narnin Dawnglow, in my opinion this is the best place to hearth in Draenor.We have new recruits coming through the portal daily. In fact one of out latest recruits, Zarjhin, just came through the portal today.If you are looking for weapons or armor Beska Redtusk will be happy to help."
5526,"Meet Me in the Cavern : It's time, <class>. Time to face the masters."
5527,"Sporicide : It's revolting, absolutely disgusting, infuriating even!I'm talking about seeing those spore creatures walking around Pinchwhistle Point.While I'm working on the machine here how about you go out and kill off some of those spore creatures? I'll feel a bit better knowing there are less of those things moving around."
5528,"Terms of Surrender : Believe it or not, I have good news: we've already taken Lok-rath.<The vindicator beams with pride.>Our soldiers have captured most of the Warsong, including their leader, Uruk Foecleaver.I saved the honor of accepting his surrender for you. They're waiting for you inside, commander."
5529,"Across the Stars : A key source of the Shadowmoon clan's power comes from their understanding of the stars and their omens.For centuries, they have recorded the patterns of the stars and their interpretations.While you are in the fortress, collect some of these documents for me.We will take their own knowledge and use it against them."
5530,"Book Burning : Please, <name>... I don't have much time.The Shadow Council have allowed themselves to be turned into demons by Teron'gor and his warlocks!I have reason to believe that the shadowborne dementors are using spells given to them by Gul'dan to empower the demonic orcs. Take their spellbooks and cast them into the fire by me... it will be a pleasant sight to die to."
5531,"Basilisk Butcher : Basilisk is one of Nisha's favorite meals. This is where she hunts, and that's likely how those Iron Horde bastards were able to capture her.Why would they go to the trouble to subdue her this way? Perhaps together, you and I might learn the answer as we punish them for their transgressions.For now, Nisha's going to need some food. While I tend to her, will you do her hunting for her?"
5532,"Field Trial : Look, I didn't tell Kimzee about this because I don't want to hurt her feelings, I chose not to leave Pinchwhistle Point.See, I've been working on a serum that I think should be able to cure the infected, but when I tried to test it I got surrounded and I injured my leg during the escape.I know I'm on the right track but I need to test it. Do me a favor and take this vial and go try it out on one of the infected outside."
5533,"Salvaging the Situation : Here at the Salvage Yard we inspect any extra material your followers bring back from the field, preserving anything that may be useful.  I have an extra pack of material our people brought in that I've yet to go through. Why don't you take it over to the incinerator and see if it contains anything useful?"
5534,"Where Are the Children? : The children have gone missing!That horrible Grumpus has been making his way throughout Draenor, snatching up children. Please save them!Our scouts have spotted him over in Frostfire Ridge."
5535,Operation: Surprise Party : There weren't many survivors of the Warsong attack. The few remaining rangari have gone up to one of the bluffs overlooking Telaar.The rangari are waiting for you. They're planning a surprise counter-attack.My copter's taken a beating. The auto-pilot's set to take you up there. I think she's got one last trip in her.Maybe.
5536,"Behind the Veil : Soon after the orcs swept in, Veil Akraz was laid to waste by a beam of light from Skyreach.<Ishaal's eyes glass over as he peers into his orb.>It seems they missed their true target. Zellek is still there, hiding in the realm of shadow.And... someone else as well. The orc assassin who used my orb.Take this. Drink it in Veil Akraz and find Zellek.Oh, and be careful. It's a little more potent than the last one. You'll see..."

Xuk not letting you take all of the skulls!Xuk will share with you powerful spirit magics my clan has passed down for many generations. While Xuk make preparations, you must gather the reagents.First, we'll need crystals from husks of goren corpses. You can find their bodies in the canyon."
5539,"The Call of Oshu'gun : The elements have spoken and a vision has been revealed, <name>.Together we shall travel to the great mountain Oshu'gun and put an end to the dark disturbance there.If what you saw in the vision is to be believed, then great danger awaits us.I will meet you in the Spirit Woods at the foot of Oshu'gun. When you are ready to depart, speak with Gixmo Moneycash and he will fly you there."
5540,"WANTED: Venombarb : Posted by: Hutou FeatherwindVenombarb is feared in the skies above Arak, even by the high arakkoa.She has made air travel difficult for our riders, preventing vital supplies from reaching Axefall.I require no proof of her demise, simply ensure her screech never again echoes among the spires.She nests above the howling crag to the northeast."
5541,"Rally the Frostwolves : My brother, in his haste, has already taken some of my clan with him and has begun an assault on Bladespire Citadel before we were ready.Draka awaits by our war horn. Please let her know that it is time to rally the clan!With the aid of you and your forces, we might actually stand a chance at victory against the ogres."

5543,"Turning Timber into Profit : Now that you know how to put lumberjacks to work harvesting timber, we're going to create a work order for your mill.But first we're going to need some timber to process!All around Draenor are juicy trees ripe for the chopping. Go out and find suitable timber for the lumber mill. Come back here when you have enough and we'll get started on a work order.And as usual, let the lumberjacks do the hard work. Just keep 'em protected. Draenor's a dangerous place!"
5544,
5545,"Shields Down! : De time has come, commanda. Packleader Kargora an' de Arkonite Shield no longa protected.We need ta kill her an' destroy de shield crystal."
5546,Burn the Bodies : You don't understand. Anythin' these plant people don't infest they fatten up and then turn inta mulch.I say we take out their food source.These botani got a few corpses lying around that I saw. Might be a good idea to burn those bodies.Let's find out if they can infest ash.
5547,WANTED: Spineslicer's Husk : Posted by: Quartermaster JolieWe're running out of supplies to repair our troops' armor.I'll pay handsomely for the husk of the mighty ravager Spineslicer. It would provide us with repair materials for weeks.
5548,"The Missing Piece : Terokk's daughter Lithic was a skilled huntress, but found her true passion in goldsmithing.  She forged this bangle as a gift for her father, and he wore it for many years. Only after Lithic passed away did he remove the bangle, for her memory was too much for the old king to bear.  Place the bangle upon the effigy, and I shall tell you of Terokk's fall."
5549,"The Gronn Strategy : Raz,Your orders are to capture four additional gronn for weaponization.Of your first group, only one survived the entire process.One attacked our soldiers relentlessly and had to be put down. Another fell victim to a misfire while being fitted. Yet another rolled onto its cannons in its sleep. We're still cleaning up that mess.Rest assured, your efforts are not in vain.- Captain Brak"
5550,"Amulet of Rukhmar: The Second Key : The first point has been activated and two more remain. The second location is hinted at in the old outcast writing:  ""Beneath the third fall of the great Skettis river lay the second key. May the ever-rushing waters sweep away those that might seek it."""
5551,"Iridium Recovery : Ared used to always teach me that the purity of the metal is key. If the metal isn't pure it will crack under stress and be of no use to anyone.For the artillery tower to function I'll need to make metal as pure as my master would, and for that I need a strong flux.The dust from crushed iridium geodes would work in a pinch, but we need to find some first. They tend to congregate underground, so check out the mine in Kuuro's Claim nearby."
5552,
5553,Leave Nothing Behind! : The Thunderlord clan has become a thorn in my side I will no longer tolerate.Go east and leave none alive! Burn their supplies! Leave them nothing to cling to.Converge on the Savage Crag to the east when it is done.
5554,"Iron Them Out : The orcs themselves are not the only threat. They still have siege weapons of significant power.  They've already been used against Tuurem, and we must not allow for their continued operation.  Sabotage siege weapons using the explosives you collected from the logging camp."
5555,Follow that Hotrod! : Miss Kimzee is one tough nugget but Pinchwhistle Point is too dangerous for her to handle alone. It'll be a catastrophe for morale if our boss gets infected.I need to get these crewmen back to the Gearworks so I need you to go and make sure she is alright.Her uncle's place is the tower just on the other side of the oil fields; I think you should look for her around there.
5556,"Scheduled Pickup : You've proven yourself more than capable in battle, <name>. As you know, there may be Shadow Council forces anywhere around Auchindoun, including near Telmor.Tuulani's powers as a soulpriest have not yet fully manifested; she isn't capable of protecting the shard alone. I need you to join her at Telmor to make sure the crystal makes it to Auchindoun safely."
5557,"Elekk Training: Thundercall : The elements can sometimes pose a problem for some beasts. Ever seen a ram in a thunderstorm? They'll hide behind anything larger than themselves. I'm not sure if they think the world is ending or what, but it's not great if you're atop one at the time.In Nagrand, off on a windswept cliff high above the shore, is a creature made of pure thunderstorms. Hop atop your elekk and face off against Thundercall, and we'll see if it gets spooked."
5558,"Pale Moonlight : We are getting strange reports of an orc attack on a nearby draenei settlement called Eventide Landing.I'm hearing these particular orcs are unlike any we have encountered before.They seem... sickly, and are pale in color.The locals could use our help, commander. This seems like the perfect opportunity to test our garrison's capabilities."
5559,"Penny From Heaven : <Durotan looks at you curiously.>  Those from your world are not much for subtlety, are they?  Go on ahead and greet our new companion. We will join you as soon as we can make ready."
5560,"Assault on the Temple of Sha'naar : Up in the hills of Tanaan Jungle, the Sargerei have converted a once-sacred temple into a den of demonic summoning.  We must attack them now, before their rituals complete. The longer we delay, the stronger our enemy grows."

There's only one way to stem the tide, <name>.<Parvink smashes her gauntleted fist against her open palm.>Smash 'em!The Temple of Sha'naar is a good place to start, or head up to the Throne of Kil'jaeden if you're looking for a real challenge."
5562,"Blood of the Burning Blade : Hallvalor is the ancestral home of my clan, the Burning Blade. When the new warlord and his family came to power, I was exiled for being a half-breed.I want justice.I suspect you won't mind killing along the way. Not that you'll have any choice."
5563,"The Crystal Shard : I'm glad you arrived when you did.The Laughing Skull orcs practice some strange spirit magic, but one of their traditions could be quite useful in our situation.While I make preparations, can you gather the reagents?First, we'll need crystals from the husks of goren corpses. You can find their bodies in the canyon."
5564,"Tree-i-cide : Commander, your engineers have brought you a present. They call it the Wood Annihilator XXI the Third, Jr.What's it do? I reckon it annihilates trees - but more importantly it will allow for the harvesting of large timber. Do you know how much timber a large tree holds? Me neither, but I bet it's a lot!There's a large piece of timber ready to be annihilated nearby. Why don't you give the contraption a test run? Bring me back whatever it harvests and I'll put it to good use."
5565,"The Lord of the Gordunni : Witch Lord Morkurk is the leader of the Gordunni. We need to kill him to secure the jovite for use in our artillery tower.Morkurk is an accomplished mage so you better be prepared. Here, take the rocket pack and use it if you need to avoid any of his deadly magic.Archenon poros!"
5566,Dropping Bombs : The Gordunni have only a single path to their fortress and it is well-defended from a large attack.Thankfully they wont be expecting just the two of us to be attempting to break in.This is a great opportunity to take out their defenses and get some target practice for our artillery gunners back at the arsenal.Take these smoke grenades and use it to call in an artillery strike on their catapults as we head up.
5567,Powering the Defenses : What few soulpriests we don't have on the front lines are working fervently to maintain Auchindoun's defenses. They aren't going to be able to keep it up much longer alone.Soulbinder Tuulani went inside the nearby Tomb of Lights to retrieve a backup power pylon and hasn't returned. I need you to find her and get her and the pylon back here safely.
5568,"I Help Ya Kill Dem : Warsong come in an' kill de draenei rangers. No lettin' dem have dis place.You an' me, Commanda. We gonna kill dem all.You be distractin' dem an' I usin' me Loa ta finish dem off. You see."
5569,"Pieces of Us : When the fires broke out, I took only my daughter's hand before we fled. It was the right decision, of course, but I do long for some of the things we left behind.I am an artificer, a shaper of crystals and gems. Without my tools I am just another refugee.Our town records are kept in a memory crystal in the main hall. With it, I can carry forward the knowledge and legacy of Aruuna.Also, my daughter is terrified - it would be a great comfort for her to hold her favorite doll again."
5570,
5571,"Gathering the Spark : We need to get our hands on arcane energy to complete our scroll. It needs that fiery kick.I have a device capable of capturing energy in the space below, so let's get moving. The infused creatures shouldn't be an issue for the two of us."
5572,"A Flare for the Dramatic : I received a strange object with a note attached. Here, it seems to be written in your tongue, commander.  <Dear Mister Durotan,  I'm Penny... you know, from Azeroth? We met briefly back at $p's garrison.   Anyway, like I told you, I have a fifth degree black hammer in engineering and I'm eager to serve. The more danger the better!  You just fire this old flare whenever you're in trouble and I'll be there, quick as a quark!  Hopefully,  Penny>"
5573,"Tastes Like Chicken : You got a moment, <bub/beautiful>? I've got an elekk-sized problem.Someone, um, sold me... yeah, sold me these two, but they're sick. I've tried everything, but nothing I do makes any difference!I think they must be starving. I heard that elekk like raw windroc. Gross if you ask me.Anyway, while you're out doing your thing, you mind picking me up some bird meat?"
5574,Target of Opportunity: Telaar : We've received reports that the draenei enclave at Telaar has fallen to the Warsong.I sent a small group of shadow hunters to check on the situation.Kajassa is their leader. Will you meet her there?
5575,"Meet Us at Starfall Outpost : The archmage has uncovered a potential Shadow Council presence in the valley. He asked me to let you know.As soon as you can, join us at Starfall Outpost. We're going to need your muscle to root them out, commander."
5576,"Growing Wood : I found this dwarf, Thuldren, runnin' out of Tangleheart like his boots were on fire.  Says his mole machine showed up here and he barely made it out alive. And another called Frenna might still be inside.  One useful thing he told me is that the creatures in there have sap that can be used to grow things real fast.  By the way, I'm gonna go lookin' for Thuldren's mole machine. Find me in Tangleheart when you're done."
5577,"Entangling an Elekk : Well, you're pretty good at this whole taming thing. What's next?We've done big, and we've done pointy. Let's do big AND pointy. I'm talking Elekks.Way out on the fertile plains of Nagrand, you'll find the finest specimens of beast this world has to offer. Grab one of the younger elekks, and we'll see if we can't get it trained like the Draenei used to."
5578,"Talbuk Training: Cruel Ogres : Nagrand is home to the mightiest beasts in Draenor, and the ogres of the region have learned to tame them using brutal techniques.There is one ogre in particular, the Gorian Beast-Lasher, that smells of blood and fear. Go on and see how your talbuk reacts to that."
5579,
5580,"The Southern Wilds : First the Iron Horde, then the Shadowmoon orcs, and now there's trouble brewing to the south!My brother is a feyrider to the south, at the Draakorium.He says that creatures from the swamp are venturing onto our lands. What is this world coming to?Anyway, you look like a seasoned adventurer. If you are heading that way, would you mind checking in over there?"
5581,
5582,Nemesis: Huojin's Fall : <Kuros hands you the bloody heart.>The ritual is complete. Your nemesis is marked for death.Now your work to rid this world of the enemy truly begins. Kill all pandaren that stand defiantly against the Alliance. Let their deaths serve as a warning to the rest of the Horde: they will leave Draenor or they will die.Return when you have quenched your rage with the blood of pandaren.Conquer our enemy and be known as Huojin's fall. Fail and be nothing.
5583,"Besting a Boar : Have you seen the boars they have here? Bigger than I am! Let's get one of them, why not?You're going to have to head to Gorgrond for that task. Way out in the desolate regions, you'll find the ones we're lookin' for."
5584,"Disarming Sha'naar : Draenei at the Temple of Sha'naar would mine these mountains for perfect crystals to power our arcane devices. Sadly, the temple is lost to us - we have been betrayed by the Sargerei.<name>, it is imperative that you venture into those mines and secure those crystals before the Sargerei use them in their demonic rituals. If you must kill our former brothers and sisters, so be it."
5585,"Gut Guttra : Snowpaw was able to help me to here so that I might strike against their leader, Guttra, but I have lost too much blood. My time is near.Do you have the strength to help me avenge my fallen brothers and sisters and kill Guttra Wolfchew?The monster resides in the tallest tower of Grimfrost."
5586,
5587,"Slave Hunters : Anytime a gladiator escapes Stonemaul, they send their hardened slave hunters after us.I consider myself a capable warrior, years of surviving in an arena have taught me that.But these slave hunters keep pendants magically tethered to the slaves. With these pendants they can track us down anywhere we go, and kill us in our sleep or when our guard is down.I have no right to ask this, but can you enter Stonemaul and retrieve these pendants?"
5588,"The Blade Itself : When they clapped me in irons, the Burning Blade instructor, Luhk the Keen-Eyed, took my blade. He's an honorable orc, even if his training techniques are counter-productive.I want my blade back, <class>."
5589,

5591,
5592,
5593,The Headhunter's Harvest : The inn provides a perfect place for adventurers to take a rest between their travels. It's also a great place to talk them into joining our cause over a few rounds of drinks.  Go through my selection and let's see if we can obtain a new recruit. I'll give you a little something as a finder's fee for your efforts.
5594,"We Die Laughing! : Are you here to help or hinder?This village is being eaten, and we must move quickly to salvage what we can.Gather the masks of our fallen Laughing Skull brothers and sisters and meet me on the western side of the village.I will need them if our clan is to rebuild."
5595,"The Pride of Lok-rath : You think the Warsong are so easily defeated?<There's a rasping sound, like rope on metal.>I'm already tired of you Alliance, and you've just invaded my homeland.<The sound becomes more pronounced as Uruk Foecleaver looks you straight in the eye.>There will be no surrender. The Warsong bow to no one!"
5596,"A Harsh Reminder : Welcome to the front lines, commander, where the wastelands and the jungle collide.The battle below rages on, but I believe one side is beginning to overwhelm the other. This cannot be allowed to happen.The gronnlings are gaining an upper hand and must be stopped before they pose a threat to Highpass.I will get closer to the battle while you thin their ranks. Meet me within Affliction Ridge when you are done."
5597,"Engorged Goren : You must be the <class> that so impressed Exarch Hataaru. Can you help?The Elodor Dig just behind me is overrun by strange stone creatures. These so-called goren actually devour minerals, metabolize them, and grow crystalline structures from their arms and back. Like most of the wildlife on this world, they completely baffle us.Please slay as many as you can and gather their crystal scales for me. You'll be protecting our earthworkers and aiding our research at the same time."

5603,"Hiding in the Shadows : <The voice of Teron'gor enters your mind.>Our final move must remain concealed from the Auchenai, my minions.

5604,
5605,Bloodied Blades of Zeth'Gol : The Bleeding Hollow clan is infamous for their blood rituals. The brutes carve sigils into their flesh and create potions from the blood of their strongest warriors.The curved ceremonial blades they use have a power all their own. Gather some of these for me.

5606,
5607,"Bringing Down the Iron Horde : Ever since the fall of Blackrock Foundry, Gul'dan has been turning the Iron Horde into... something worse. The orcs who once flocked to Grommash's banner, through either fear or thirst for revenge, are now embracing the fel.Wade into the battlefields of Tanaan and lay waste to Gul'dan's forces. Orc or fel orc makes no difference. Gut what remains of the Iron Horde!"

Fail and be nothing.
5732,
5733,The Slavemaster's Demise : Share word with the others of the Frostwolves you saved this day. They will be glad to know that some made it out of the mines alive.
5734,Disrupt the Rituals : No longer do the Warsong seek to be one with the elements; instead they abuse their power by using it to channel the darkness of the void.I will not tolerate these rituals to continue. Locate the ritual totems the Warsong use to channel the void and destroy them.The gift of the elements was not given to the orcs only to be defiled and used as a plaything.

5737,"Lost in Nagrand : Hey, <mister/lady>, could you help me?There's this girl I know. Her name's Olgra. Her and her parents went back to Wor'var yesterday. Only, they never got there and no one's seen them.If you're heading back out, would you look for her?She's kinda my girlfriend."
5738,
5739,"Rites of the Talonpriests : That gavel was once known as Beakbreaker. In his final, darkest days, Terokk used it to perform grim, damnable acts of sacrifice.   It is best not to dwell on those days.  Terokk was sealed away deep within the shadows to rest, and perhaps to heal.  Making contact with him will take a great deal of effort, so in the meantime, allow me to tell you of his more glorious exploits. Before this wretched curse took hold.  Please, place the gavel upon the effigy."
5740,"Whacking Weeds : Something needs to be done about the podling menace in Spiteleaf Thicket!Alongside Hemet Nesingwary, I've hunted some of the largest and most terrifying beasts around. Never in my life have I encountered a creature as vile, depraved, nefarious or degenerate as a podling!The vicious little monsters spread themselves like weeds and if something isn't done, they'll spread across the entire continent!Make your way into Spiteleaf Thicket and slay as many podlings as you can find!"
5741,"We Have Him Now : We have Gardul right cornered, commander.Ye have a much better chance against him than me. Take him out, grab the formula from his corpse, and grab as many barrels o' poison as ye can carry.I'll stay here and make sure nae reinforcements come to Gardul's aid."

We desperately need those supplies so we may enact your will!"
5745,"Capturing a Clefthoof : Greetings, friend. I have been told that you are in need of a master of beasts. I come from the icy slopes of Northrend to finally shake this snow from my fur.This savage land holds many creatures that we may tame so that our forces may ride on formidable war mounts. The mighty clefthoof reminds me of the mammoths from my home. Take this lasso and head out to the northern reaches of Frostfire Ridge. Mount up and use it to capture one of the young beasts."
5746,"Vintage Free Action Potion : The Alliance have increased their usage of snares, roots and stuns on our melee forces. Luckily I have just the potion for them. The recipe is a little old, but it'll work. A key ingredient I need can be found here in Ashran, at the beach near that Ogre Tower."
5747,"Talbuk Training: Riplash : Many beasts will cower in fear at the sight of a mighty predator. In the desolate cliffs of Gorgrond lives one of the most fierce. It will prove your next challenge.Take your beast to the nest of the great Riplash, and see if you cannot emerge victorious."
5748,"Obtaining Ogre Offensive Orders : My sister, Mirana, is scouting the upper bluff while I've checked out the lower area. There are two particular ogre mages that do a lot of bossing around in the lower area.They seem to have some orders or scrolls on them that would help us figure out what's really going on.Collect that information and meet with my sister on the long stairway up there."
5749,"Boar Training: Gezz'ran : There's plenty more beasts out in the wild that can make a snack of your favorite mount. One of the most cunning on Draenor is the stalker.Stalkers can blend into their environments, allowing them to sneak in and steal the eggs of nearby prey. See if you and your boar can't overcome this natural defense mechanism. You'll find some mean stalkers out in Talador."
5750,
5751,"Shot-Caller : <Solar energy courses through the slumbering constructs, their ancient servos whirring to life all around you. It is too late to shut them down now.Outside, an arakkoa overseer bellows commands, each answered by the buzz of an Apexis beam carving away at the mountain.That turret would make short work of the constructs - if you can command it.>"
5752,"Deeproot : Since yer all set up to take on trees and bushes now, I need ta ask for a favor.I came to Gorgrond in search of an expedition of me fellow Dark Irons that were headed this way. Sadly I lost 'em.I am goin' south to look for them. Thing is, south is nothing but botani, podlings, giant trees, and other mean, angry plants.Yer lumber camp resources would be mighty appreciated. If ya help me look for me friends I swear we'll help ya in any way we can."
5753,"Nobundo Sends Word : Your presence has been requested at the Throne of Elements, <name>.Vindicator Nobundo has heard the call of the furies upon the wind and made the journey to commune with the elements.I know not what the intentions of the furies are, but they are revered as noble and powerful spirits by the orcs."
5754,"WANTED: Hilaani : We need more meat, commander.I know what you're thinking. What about all of that meat right behind me?That's the problem. It'll be gone in a day if we're lucky.There's a riverbeast that lives in the lake to the south. Locals call her Hilaani. Massive, lots of meat.If you would take down the beast and bring me her meat, your wolves will be better off for it."
5755,"Vignette: Yaga the Scarred : Goren are dangerous, especially in large numbers, and especially when we have a blind, under powered shaman with us.Fortunately, they have very short lifespans. Unfortunately, they multiply fast and grow faster.If we are going to do this we need to find the brood mother. Slaying her and her eggs should slow down the onslaught of goren. Check the burrows near the Forge Gates and I will to keep them off of Drek'Thar's scent."

5760,
5761,"Ring of Trials: Hol'yelaa : You won your first two fights, but it's only going to get tougher from here!Your next fight is against Hol'yelaa, a former rangari who is as crazy as they come.No, really... Hol'yelaa is bonkers!Years ago, while on a scouting mission, he single handedly saved his entire rangari unit from a pack of Garn. But something inside of him snapped....It wasn't long before Hol'yelaa went completely marbles and turned on his own unit!Alright, the pep talk is over! Get in there and kick some ass!"
5762,
5763,"A Curse Upon the Woods : Cordana tells me that the creatures of the woods are cursed by the same fel energies keeping Khadgar from scrying into the orc village.This will not do.If we were on Azeroth, I could find a cure in a reasonable timeframe. However, we are not, nor do we have the luxury of time.Better to put a swift end to their suffering rather than allow these poor creatures to linger with demonic energy."
5764,"Prime the Cannons : The armory is lost to the traitors. All we have left are these few cannons with no ammunition.Soldier, I need you to recover cannonballs so we can get these things running.Actually, one more cannon wouldn't hurt, either."
5765,"Seedbearers of Bad News : When these seedbearers are slain their seeds survive. From them spring new seedbearers, not over years, but hours.Leaving their remains here would soon cause the outpost to be overrun.We have learned that burning their remains prevents this from happening."
5766,
5767,"Looking for Lumber : Some of the trees around here look small enough that the workers should be able to down them in no time.We can leave the hard labor to Shelly's men, but if you'd be willing to mark the trees for them to start with, we should be able to get this operation rolling much faster."
5768,"Vignette: Gruuk : Goren are dangerous, especially in large numbers, and especially when we have a blind, under powered shaman with us.Fortunately, they have very short lifespans. Unfortunately, they multiply fast and grow faster.If we are going to do this we need to find the brood mother. Slaying her and her eggs should slow down the onslaught of goren.

Don't worry about the safety of your caravan this time; I will dispatch a rangari detail to shadow them from the woods and protect them.The Exarchs will always watch over you.Your supplies should be waiting for you when you return to your garrison. Good luck with your campaign, <name>!"
5771,
5772,"A Pilgrimage Gone Awry : I am a humble pilgrim, I swear. Please don't hurt me!My sister and I were traveling to Auchindoun to pay our respects to my grandmother when we hit an overturned rock and lost control of our caravan. I managed to survive, but my sister...<Nadur cries.>Please, you have to help me. I'm desperate. If you could bring me some prowler blood, snapdragon flowers, and a riverhopper eye, I can fashion a potion to bring her back. I just know it...."
5773,"Dropping In : Witch Lord Morkurk is no fool.He has catapults set up throughout the foothills leading into their compound.No matter, I have a way to handle them.Take out the ogres guarding the siege weapons and mark them once they're clear. I'm readying a vortex spell that will handle things from there.We'll meet just outside their gate afterwards."
5774,"Upgrades in Ashran : You got some construction guides or assembly notes on ya? Oh man that's good news!I know this guy in Ashran, goes by Torgg Flexington. He's got finished blueprints we need!Go talk to this guy and bring back some good stuff for us to build, ok?"
5775,"Guardians of the Plateau : The Elemental Plateau is sanctuary to the elemental spirits of Nagrand.The greatest among the elementals on the plateau are the guardians; mighty elemental spirits that stand watch over their domain.The guardians are pure and mighty spirits but a disturbance in the natural balance has caused them to grow unstable, corrupting the lesser elementals around them.In order to restore balance to the plateau, the guardians must be destroyed. Only then will the cycle of rebirth begin."
5776,On the Mend : Nisha will heal.This ordeal has taken a toll on her. She needs water and rest.I will bring her to my camp and make her comfortable.Will you meet us there with some fresh water?
5777,
5778,Trophy of Glory: Fungal Praetorian : Defeating the Fungal Praetorian has yielded you a trophy worthy of acclaim.Take this to Maraad at Highpass.
5779,"Wolf Training: Orc Hunters : The Warsong Clan of Nagrand are some of the best hunters I've ever had the misfortune of meeting. If anyone can pose a real test for your future mount, it's one of their chief beast-killers.Out in Nagrand, you'll find an orc by the name of Karak. They call him the Great Hunter, and he's taken down more fierce beasts than any other in the clan. Get astride your wolf and bring him down. In the name of the poor wee beasts!"
5780,
5781,"Fungal Bundle : The umbraspore giant you killed seemed immune to the volatile spores in the area. Perhaps the odd growths you found all over its body contribute to its immunity. You grab a big, disgusting fungal lump in order to give it to the rangari for study."
5782,Prized Repossessions : The Gordunni have plagued the people of Shattrath ever since the city was founded. Over time they amassed quite a hoard of weapons they captured from our defenders in raids.Getting these weapons in the hands of our soldiers would be practical and I personally would like to get them out of the hands of the ogres.While we are in here can you do me a favor and gather up any of those weapons you come across.
5783,"Culling the Crew : If we're going to protect Draenor from the Bonefleet menace, we'll need to thin out the crew.See to a swift reduction in their numbers, and we might just push them back into the sea for another year."
5784,"Scrap Meltdown : We've had a breakthrough in melting down the scraps you've been collecting! If you can get me a small pile of 'em, we can get your troops something a bit more useful."

If you wish to help us, go to Arbor Glen and kill any Shadowmoon enemies that you see."
5788,"Lurkers : Dis be a dangerous place, boss-mon.Filled with big monsters and savage giants.Well, like my family loa say, 'If ya can't beat it, poison it.'We gonna be needin' some venom from the lurkers out there on the Cracking Plains.

5790,"Vignette: Jehil the Climber : Goren are dangerous, especially in large numbers, and especially when we have a blind, under powered shaman with us.Fortunately, they have very short lifespans. Unfortunately, they multiply fast and grow faster.If we are going to do this we need to find the brood mother. Slaying her and her eggs should slow down the onslaught of goren. Check the burrows near the Forge Gates and I will to keep them off of Drek'Thar's scent."
5791,"Boar Training: Bulbapore : Way down south in the Spires of Arak, the land's being overtaken by the mushrooms that grow underwater. The result? Strange fungal creatures sprouting up all over the place.Taking on a strange creature, like the fungal giant Bulbapore, gives us a great chance to expose your boar to predators it's unfamiliar with."
5792,"Boar Training: Orc Hunters : The Warsong Clan of Nagrand are some of the finest hunters the world of Draenor has ever known. Their beast-killers will aid us in putting this mount to the test.Out in Nagrand, you will find an orc by the name of Karak, the Great Hunter. He has slain more fierce beasts than any other in the clan. Face him astride your mount, and avenge the slain."
5793,
5794,Come Together : Gul'dan and his cronies would do well to remember this day. We Auchenai are not to be trifled with.You should inform Vindicator Icia in your outpost of our success. She can reach out to the scattered refugees and their families.
5795,Nemesis: Dwarfstalker : <Raza'kul hands you the bloody heart.>The ritual is complete. Your nemesis is marked for death.Now your work to rid this world of the enemy truly begins. Kill all dwarves that stand defiantly against the Horde.

Fail and be nothing.
5796,"Send Them Running : Your scouts have located the saberon's alpha male just outside our gates!Commander, I believe that dispatching this target will send any of these remaining vermin running back to their caves.I do not wish to ask more of you, but you are the only one capable of this task, <sir/ma'am>."

Fail and be nothing.
5798,"Vicious Viziers : We can't just skate in, kill Witch Lord Morkurk, and leave.His three lieutenants - Vorgorsh, Zulmork, and Cromaug - are all fiercely loyal to Morkurk, and are all respectable mages in their own right.I suspect that if we attempt to engage the Witch Lord immediately that they will rush to his aid and overwhelm us. We need to take out his lieutenants first."
5799,
5800,
5801,
5802,"The Friend of My Enemy : Hallvalor is the ancestral home of the Burning Blade clan. Since they're such fast friends, the Warsong have allowed the blademasters to remain in Nagrand.We are fierce, but we won't win if the Burning Blade attack us. It would be wise to strike first."
5803,"Eye in the Sky : The notes you recovered tell of a device capable of subjugating even a magnaron.Ancient legends speak of such artifacts, crafted by the worldbuilders to keep these creatures in check. I had discounted them as silly stories, but if they are true...<name>, Draenor is doomed.No army will be able to stop them if they harness this power. We must stop them or die trying.Here, I shall bind our sight to Nisha and hope she can locate this artifact."
5804,"Xuk Me, Right? : The magics Xuk is weaving will let you perform great acts, but preparations must be made before the spirits will bless us with their power.Xuk needs many shells from the pesky goren. To gather them, Xuk will share a secret.Approach their tunnel craters and the goren will pour out. This way, you kill many at once."
5805,To Thunder Pass : There is no time to mourn our fallen or lick our wounds. Your scouts have already reported sighting a massive Iron Horde army making its way through Thunder Pass.I advise you let your garrison forces secure this area while you and I make for the pass east of here with the rest of the Frostwolves.It is time to show this Iron Horde what a united Frostwolf clan can do.
5806,Trophy of Glory: Erosian : Defeating Erosian has yielded you a trophy worthy of acclaim.Take this to Maraad at Highpass.

5811,"Guise of the Deceiver : In a cave not far from here, there lives an old woman named Challe.I knew Challe many years ago when I was young; though as I have become old and grey, she has kept her youth and beauty.Challe was jealous of my love for Dahaka and I have long suspected that Challe had a part in her death. However, without evidence I could not bring justice against her.Meet with Challe and tell her that I am dying. Tell her that I wish to know the truth of Dahaka's fate before I leave this world."
5812,
5813,"Disrupting the Flow : You there, we need to stop the flow of demon reinforcements!Do you see the floating fel crystals spread throughout the front? Those resonators are powering the portals unleashing hell on our forces. I need you to take them out!"

It'll be faster work with an extra pair a hands."
5815,"Shadowmoonwell : The archmage has asked me to prepare this moonwell. Once it is completed, I'll be able to sanctify its water for use against the demon.Only one thing remains.A piece of one of Draenor's moons has fallen into a nearby pool on the far side of the woods. Such a thing is perfect for use in the dedication of the moonwell to Elune.Will you bring it back for me, <name>?"
5816,"A Clew of Worms : While I was scouting, I noticed that most of Frostwind Crag is crawling with an odd species of worm.The worst thing about them is that these things burrow under the ground and then spring on you from out of nowhere.I saw the worms attacking the frost wolves and other wildlife in the wastes. I'm certain the orcs would appreciate you helping out."
5817,"Stop the Flow : The Shadow Council down in the boneyard are going to have magic circles. It's not enough to simply kill them; we also have to eliminate their infernal devices.If you destroy the circles, you'll stop the flow of demons they're summoning to inhabit the bones of the dead."
5818,"Back to Work : Alright, boss. We're gonna need some lumber if we're gonna get this garrison started off right.  If you mark some trees to be cut down, your peons will do the rest."
5819,"Cauterizing Wounds : You have saved my most precious companion, Nisha. I owe you a great debt.The Iron Horde lured me away to separate us. I shall not make the same mistake again.They have inflicted grievous wounds, and I fear we must cause her even more pain before the healing process can begin.Please use a burning log from the nearby fire to cauterize her wounds.I will hold her down."
5820,"Clefthoof Training: The Garn : The last test for your mount will pit it against one of the great terrors of this land.The garn. Wolves as black as night, and twice the size of a normal wolf, they can tear an orc apart in mere moments. The beasts here wisely fear them.There is a lone garn that calls Nagrand its home. Take your clefthoof, mount up, and bring it down. If the two of you survive, your clefthoof will truly be ready."
5821,"Defenstrations : No sooner does power rush to the crystal outside than you hear distant war cries and shouts of alarm. Elodor is being attacked!If you want your laborers to come home in one piece, you'd best help with the defense of the town. Defeat the invasion and then return to the control console to reset the defenses."
5822,"Elekk Training: Darkwing Roc : The windrocs of Nagrand are a smart predator, often swooping down on unwary prey in packs. If your beast doesn't keep an eye on the sky, it's likely to lose both of em.'Head on out to Nagrand and take on the fiercest windroc of the bunch, the Darkwing Roc. That'll be a good test for the both of ye."
5823,Prune the Podlings : The blood soaked body of Ryan is slumped up against the cave wall. Tiny teeth marks cover his body.The podlings clearly are a threat to you and your garrison.It's time to do a little pruning.

5825,
5826,
5827,Nemesis: Terror of the Tushui : <Raza'kul hands you the bloody heart.>The ritual is complete. Your nemesis is marked for death.Now your work to rid this world of the enemy truly begins.

Fail and be nothing.
5828,"Ill Tempered : <Prying the lid off the scroll case reveals a plan by the Iron Horde to use large fish in the oceans around Draenor to interfere with Alliance and Horde naval power. Incredibly, the plan seems to have already worked on smaller sharks, but only up to a point.>"
5829,
5830,"The Shimmering Crystal : Though the crystal appears familiar at first, upon contact with your finger it reveals itself as so much more. A grand, lost civilization appears in front of you. Fixtures of gold shimmer in every direction, bright feathers of purple occasionally falling from overhead. You hear the distant sounds of battle, culminating in a thunderous explosion that overwhelms all of your senses and turns your vision white.  When your vision returns, you feel something within you pulling you toward Ashran."
5831,
5832,"New Neighbors : The Shattered Hand clan is made up of orcs who can call no other clan home. They are sadistic warriors who maim their bodies, perhaps in a show of solidarity or perhaps because they simply enjoy the pain.It does not matter. What matters is that they are expanding their territory, butchering anyone in their path.They must be dealt with."
5833,Dust of the Dead : I thought if I could just bring him here that I might be able to correct his transgression against the Light. That perhaps I could save my son! Now my beloved Arumel is a twisted phantasm.I'm left with no choice but to right my wrongs and I need your help.Bring me duskwing dust from the moths on Duskfall Island. With your aid I can craft an elixir that will let us travel to the realm of the dead and lay Arumel to rest.
5834,"What Must Be Done : I believe we have seen this demonic corruption your friends speak of.The Mother of Wolves has not been herself lately. Now, her pack has her surrounded.The wolves are protecting our hunters and will not let them near. They're not likely to stop you, though.If the alpha mother is infected with this fel-energy, then she must be put down.You would greatly honor the Frostwolves by returning with her corpse and giving it a proper burial."
5835,Have a Heart : Did you notice the magical barrier protecting the cave's entrance? It's being powered by demon crystals.The Burning Legion has a habit of making demon parts serve as the keys to such devices.Travel west to the Ruins of Ata'gar. Look for a powerful demon therein and bring me its heart.I'll project an image of myself into the ruins. You won't have to come back here until we're done.
5836,"Elekk Training: Cruel Ogres : This beast is surely at home in Nagrand, and I bet ye after all of the years of domestication by Draenei, it's going to be a snap to train.Let's set it loose against the ogres of the region that yer familiar with. That Gorian Beast-Lasher, the one that smells of blood and fear, go on and see how your elekk  reacts to that."
5837,"Every Bit Counts : The Jorune Mine, west of here, needs your help!My good friend Ageilaa sent me to look for help. Exarch Maladaar sent over what vindicators he could spare, but it isn't enough!Will you go to the mine and help us? We need the crystals from the mine to create more defenses like the crystals you see on the Burning Front."
5838,
5839,"The Warlord's Guard : I don't know what you are accustomed to, traveler, but these lands devour the weak. Perhaps Durotan wishes to rid himself of you. We shall see.You must kill the Warlord of the Circle of Blood. Do this and the ogres here will be defeated. But first, you must find him.I have located his bodyguards nearby. Slay them and bring me their heads. With them, we shall lure the Warlord into the open."
5840,"Shields Up! : The Warsong packleader is trying to raise Telaar's shield. If Kargora does that, the Warsong will have an impervious base.So far, they've only managed to initiate the shield. This has the undesirable side effect of protecting the packleader and her shaman at the main crystal.Activate the crystals on the perimeter of Telaar. That will force the shield to fully deploy.Once you do that, Kargora will be exposed."
5841,"We Have Company : Outsider, I've spotted Iron Horde soldiers nearby.It is bold, even for them, to venture into such deadly territory.If you do not deal with their presence, they will surely be a threat to your camp."
5842,"The Farseer Awaits : Your presence has been requested at the Throne of Elements, <name>.Farseer Drek'Thar heard the call of the furies upon the wind and made the journey to commune with the elements.The Farseer has sent word that you are to join him at the Throne of Elements.Go and see what the elements would have of you."
5843,
5844,"Legacy of the Apexis : The Apexis are long gone, but their legacy lies preserved in ancient chambers beneath Arak.Legions of dormant constructs; crystals flush with solar energy; magical techniques lost to the ages - the Apexis left behind caches of immense power, which the Adherents of Rukhmar have begun to unearth.Bring me the cores of the re-activated constructs patrolling the excavation site. Those crystals are the basis of Apexis technology, and the key to our enemy's devastating power."
5845,Second in Command : Wait... I remember something else.Sir Edward... he was shouting... looking for someone.I... I can't remember who. There were so many screams...
5846,At the End of Your Rope : With the spears and rope you gathered the Thunderlord Sky Riders will no longer be out of our reach. Even they will feel our wrath!I've tied the rope to the spears you brought me to fashion a harpoon. Hunt the Sky Riders that are flying all over the valley. Take the Harpoon and throw it at them as they circle by. If your aim is true the barbs should allow the spear a firm hold allowing you to yank the rider right towards you!If your aim is bad... well... try not to miss.
5847,"Cut Them Down : They steal children? Children?!Had you not rescued Kaz's child, he would be reduced to mulch just like the others.You should send them a message they will understand. Cut down their great dew casters. Rip them apart.Let them know that it is not okay to take our children."

My heart is heavy with grief to see such a great creature mindless and enslaved by evil.There is no going back, in order to push forward you must go through Gordawg.It pains me, but Gordawg must be slain.Slay Gordawg and return the fury's heart to the Throne of Elements where it belongs."

The captain of the guard, Restalaan, tried to stop them and they took him into the cathedral!If we can just get this crystal, we can reunite the Heart of Auchindoun and turn its defenses on fully! We can't afford to fail now.<name>, you're the only one left that can do it. You have to find Restalaan! He'll know where they took it."

5857,"They Rely on Numbers : Thunderlord spend their days training to hunt as a team, but as individuals they are weak. Their only strength is in numbers.So... to win, we must cull their numbers.As we move up through the Daggermaw Ravine, slay any Thunderlord who stand in your way, and their clan will be made the weaker for it."
5858,"Enfilade : If we leave now, my clan's final assault on Grom'gar will be a disaster.Though our warriors are unmatched in melee, the Thunderlords have new ranged weapons - our forces would be decimated as they cross the Icewind Drifts.But WE are already here. We can overtake those weapons before they ever fire.Blackrock orcs help our enemies forge these ""cannons"" in the workshops on the south side. If we use their own tools to sabotage the weapons, we leave Grom'gar wide open to a Frostwolf raid."
5859,
5860,"Balance of Power : At long last, it is time to reap the fruits of your labors.Lothrius tells of a place deep in the former Moonguard Stronghold used to infuse new Guards with immense power. It will be the perfect place to tap into and augment the power of the Nightshards you gathered.Gather your effects and meet me there when you are ready, and we will use the Heart to finally reveal the great power within your artifact."
5861,"Champions of Legionfall : The battle to reclaim the Broken Shore is straining our resources. We cannot afford to relent, lest the Legion undo all that we have accomplished.  The members of your order have given much, but more is needed.  Rally your champions and do what you must to bolster their ranks. There may be untapped power in this land that will turn the tide of war in our favor."
5862,"Assault on Broken Shore : It has been a long and costly war, <name>. It is time we put an end to it.  We will drive the Burning Legion from their seat of power and close their gateway into Azeroth. Our first step is to gain a foothold on the Broken Shore.

5864,"The Power Within : Do you have a moment, Conjurer?The power within your weapon has grown exponentially as you have fought the Legion, but I cannot help but wonder if there is something... more... hidden away within. Perhaps even a new form entirely!The very thought demands we find out for sure.The ancient blue dragon in Azsuna known as Senegos lays dying and is key to our journey. You must aid him - I will meet you in his domain as soon as I am able."
5865,"Visitor in Shal'Aran : Someone came to Shal'Aran while you were in the City. She asked for you specifically.I did not recognize her face, nor her voice, but she seemed trustworthy and earnest.She is just outside the cavern. Meet with her and determine her purpose for coming here."
5866,"Defending Broken Isles : In our zeal to reclaim the Broken Shore from the Legion, we cannot allow the rest of this land to fall into the demons' foul grip.  Kil'jaeden has dispatched his forces across the Broken Isles, threatening the homelands of the allies you have made. You must answer their call in this hour of need.

They will fail.  Lure out the strongest among their vile ranks. Slay them and seize the marks they bear. Make the Legion fear our strength!"
5872,"Pillars of Creation : Our campaign on the Broken Shore has reached a turning point. The Armies of Legionfall stand ready to breach the Tomb of Sargeras and seal the Legion's gateway to our world.  The time to strike is now, <name>.  The Aegis of Aggramar has been secured in the Cathedral. The echo of Magna Aegwynn said that the other Pillars of Creation are needed to seal the tomb. It is fitting that you have the honor of locking those ancient relics in place and closing down the Felstorm once and for all."
5873,"The Hand of Fate : Ever since the Legion invaded the Exodar, the draenei have been hard at work preparing to return to Argus. At long last they have a vessel that can take us there.  With the way to that dreadful world open, we simply could not ask for a better opportunity to strike. Prophet Velen called for you quite specifically to join the assault force.  You should make your way to Bladefist Bay right away. Arrangements have been made for a ship there to take you to Azuremyst."
5874,"Championing Our Cause : Important work has been done by your order, <class>t. Your champions have succeeded time and again in undermining the Legion's invasion.  As we make preparations for our assault on the Tomb of Sargeras, we need to keep the demons off balance. By pressuring them at every turn, we will expose vulnerabilities that can be exploited to our advantage.  Send out your order's champions, <name>. Their missions are vital to the success of our campaign... especially as our confrontation with Kil'jaeden draws closer."
5875,"The Broken Shore: Investigating the Legion : While we focus efforts on the Broken Shore, we must be careful to guard against other threats. We have been getting disturbing reports on the Legion starting or supporting indirect threats to Azeroth.  While you are on the Broken Shore, please keep an eye out for strange objects or intelligence that could give us a clue as to what and where these threats are.  I know it is not a lot to go on, we will do our best from here as well."
5876,"Giving It All We've Got : The arcan'dor is drawing incredible amounts of energy.  Even with the leyline feed at full capacity, we may not have the power.  Let us first ensure that all potential leyline conduits connecting to Shal'Aran are active.  Then I can attempt to amplify the output and hopefully satisfy this insufferable plant."
5877,"One Day at a Time : Thank you for coming, outlander. It is good to see you again.  I have a situation in the city that needs your attention, but first...   Let us talk of hope.  <Thalyssra gestures toward the arcan'dor.>  The fruit of the arcan'dor can truly free my people from the Nightwell. However, it only grows so fast. It will take time to distribute this cure.  I think it only right that you help me pass out the fruit as it is ready. Please take this, and give it to anyone."
5878,"A Beacon in the Dark : That was... an intense experience.<Alleria rubs her forehead.>It is difficult to focus. I need you to return to Velen. Give him this.<She places something cold and dense in your palm.>I feel as though he should have it, though I am not sure why.Tell him all that we have learned. I am sure Romuul will have been watching our progress. With any luck, a beacon is already headed our way."
5879,"Twisted Power : It is time we put our work to the test by infusing the most potent source of power I know of - fel magic.Rarely, the Legion's minions will carry fragments of the greater portal stones used to usher in their eredar masters. If you gather enough to form a complete stone, you can use it in Faronaar to call forth the eredar lord Vizuul the Twisted at the Altar of End Times.The bindings Vizuul wears to augment his power should push the Heart to its very limit."
5880,"A Change of Seasons : It is time.  The arcan'dor is preparing to mature. With a final burst of growth, this gift will be fully realized.  We must make ready the leyline feed."

For millennia, we have migrated from one hovel to the next, moving each time the Legion discovered us. Never able to flee with our possessions, we left them behind.  You are powerful, your followers are capable, but you do not know Argus. The landscape will dispatch you as mercilessly as the Legion. Recover our supplies from Darkfall Ridge, and I will order my people to guide your forces through the Argus Wastes."
5883,"Dabbling in the Demonic : Levia must have used these runes to aid her ritual. Even if she is as powerful as Modera says, she was a novice in demonic magic, so the runes must have helped stabilize the portal.  I'll need you to find out what runes need to be activated to recreate her ritual. There are several books on runic magic in this room, which she no doubt studied for her ritual.  Once you have activated the runes, I will complete the spell."

Take my pet cat, Fiona, and find these well hidden spies."

It is not much, but I would like to honor his last request.  <Vanthir hands you the scroll.>  Go to the location marked on this map. Take this Arcan'dor Fruit and give it to a woman named Arluelle. Arluin was very specific that all rewards for his work be directed to her.  I think he may have known what his sacrifice meant. I was wrong about him."
5891,"Lost Mail : TO: MADAM GOYA, DALARAN UNDERBELLY  URGENT!  TIME-SENSITIVE!   DELIVER IMMEDIATELY!"
5892,"Stabilizing Suramar : Elisande's plan has backfired. She thought to stamp out our rebellion by making an example of the Waning Crescent.   Instead, she ignited the flame of the shal'dorei better than I ever could.  We must maintain a cohesive campaign against Elisande and the Legion by fighting them in every corner of Suramar.   Show the people that there is still hope - that there are still heroes willing to fight for them!"
5893,"Memories of Ebonchill : Is that Ebonchill you've got there? Alodi's old staff? My my my... <Cough>In the days of the first guardian, all the members of the Council of Tirisfal granted their powers to the young mage in the hopes that he could overcome the Legion. <Wheeze> None of them are alive today... but that staff of yours remembers.Search the streets of Dalaran below for reflections of the former council members. Their memories may empower you as they once did Alodi. Seek them out and speak with one!"

5895,"Volpin the Elusive : According to the map, the fox hunt will start at the Feathermane Hunting Grounds in Suramar. If the Nightborne succeed, they will kill Volpin, a fox that is the last of his kind in the Broken Isles.  Travel to the Hunting Grounds, and interrupt the hunt."
5896,"The Nighthold: Into the Nighthold : Our work is very nearly complete. Now that the Heart can safely absorb power from fel magic, we need the strongest sources of it that we can get our hands on.Gul'dan has called the nightborne's elite back to the Nighthold to aid him. The storm of fel energy above the palace has seeped into the very fabric of their being, even making its way into the crystallized pieces of the Nightwell that many carry with them.Those shards are exactly what we need, <name>. Save as many as you can in your assault."
5897,"Begin Construction : We've got the supplies. Now someone needs to decide what to do with 'em.  Hmm. Looks like it's your call, being the <class>t and all!  Time to pick a building to focus on."

Zantini and his pets, Strigfellow and Speedy IV, were bringing back a rare murloc pet, along with some other pets and supplies.  <name>, please find Zantini and his pets. Help them out. Then we can try to recover the pets and the supplies."

5901,The Nightfallen : Assist the Nightfallen of Suramar by completing 4 world quests.
5902,"A Growing Crisis : The Arcan'dor is failing.  This energy was once bound in its boughs and fueled its growth. There was balance, between life and arcane.  Now that energy is breaking free. When the heart can no longer hold it, this tree will kill every living thing in this hall.  I have seen this happen before and I must find a way to stop it from happening again.   We must go to the tree that came before. Its bones can guide us.  Meet me at the temple of Fal'adora. We will descend together."
5903,"Relieved of Their Valuables : Not all demons on this shore stomp around in the open. Some slink about in the shadows, finding more subtle ways to advance the Legion's cause.  I have been observing the behavior of smaller demons, these wyrmtongues. They seem to spend considerable time acquiring objects of power. We cannot allow them to use these items against us.  The wyrmtongues stash their goods in chests spread around the Broken Shore. I suggest you relieve them of their ill-gotten gain."
5904,"Fuel of a Doomed World : There is a rare and precious resource to be found in these wastes, <name>.Argunite was once abundant on Argus. Its magical properties helped eredar civilization thrive. Far better for us to make use of its power than the Legion.Seek out all the pristine argunite you can, champion. Every bit you recover will aid our cause."
5905,"Grimwing the Devourer : You have my thanks for rescuing me from captivity, <name>.However, Azoran is no mere demon. He is a powerful eredar who commands great rank within the Burning Legion.Before we can get to him, there is another that must be destroyed.Grimwing the Devourer is the strongest of the felbats. Place the basilisk flesh upon the altar to the north and slay Grimwing when she appears.Then, return to me with her head. My thirst for vengeance must be quenched."
5906,"Strike Them Down : The Felstorm continues to rain demon scum upon these shores. Kil'jaeden believes his army infinite, his resources inexhaustible.  We will show him how wrong he is.  Cut a swath of retribution through their ranks, <class>t. Strike down demon after demon, until your weapons are bathed in their blood. And when they cry out for mercy, send them screaming back into the Nether."
5907,"Shard Times : As you have surely noticed, a slain demon leaves behind Nethershards, solidified residual energy from the Twisting Nether. I require a significant quantity of them for an experiment I'm conducting... $1oa shards, to be precise.Why are you looking at me like that? We've had this conversation before. I did the math.I need exactly $1oa shards. Fewer would be inadequate. More would be absurd.Don't question my methods. Go!"
5908,"The Tears of Elune : The Tear of Elune floats effortlessly, glistening in an ethereal pillar of moonlight."
5909,"Eye of Azshara: The Heart of Zin-Azshari : The naga in the Eye of Azshara summon terrible storms that ravage the coastline of Azsuna - storms far beyond the abilities of even their best sirens.It can only be the Heart of Zin-Azshari.Prior to the Sundering, Azshara's chosen used the Heart to greatly magnify their power - it is said to have been key in their dominance of the Well of Eternity.If you can journey to their domain and retrieve it, <name>, we will put its power to far better use than those foul creatures."

It is there that you will find Prophet Velen.I will open a portal for you now. Take my beacon and use it when you are ready to return."
5911,"Gatekeeper's Challenge: Cunning : Archimonde expected greatness from his pupils. Only the most imaginative minds, the most adroit of intellects, could ever truly fathom the deepest reaches of our magic.I doubt you can relate.The path to the left will take you to a set of three statues. Use them to collect a Mark of Cunning.To preserve the integrity of this trial, I will not be able to provide hints. If you do, by some miracle, happen to succeed, I will formally recognize your... brilliance."
5912,"Arcan'dor, Gift of the Ancient Magi : Thousands of years ago, as the Quel'dorei were just beginning to unravel the mysteries of the arcane, a small enclave of druids met with the first of the elven magi.  In the pale moonlight, they formed an order that would seek to bring the arcane into balance - using nature itself as a vessel. Thus the arcan'dor were created.  My masters who belonged to this order have long since faded away. Yet their legacy remains.  Their gift will mend the spirit of the shal'dorei. Let them eat, and be made whole."
5913,"The Mark : Your blade is powerful, but it has not yet met its full potential. The all-powerful Odyn in the Halls of Valor can bestow upon you his strength.In order to seek this blessing, you must bring him a worthy tribute. I know where you may obtain such a gift, but in order to retrieve it you must first receive the mark of the Valkyra.Prove yourself worthy of our mark, champion, then you may enter the Vault of Eyir- the goddess will guide you from there."
5914,"Legionfall Supplies : If we don't build up some respectable fortifications, we'll lose our foothold on the Broken Shore.  That ain't gonna happen on my watch, mate!  We started construction on three key structures: the Mage Tower, the Nether Disruptor, and the Command Center. Each will play a key role in helping us pound the tar out of the Burning Legion.  To make progress, we need Legionfall War Supplies... and I mean lots of 'em! You bring 'em to me, and I'll handle distribution. Got it?"
5915,"Or Against Us : If Ly'leth is to achieve the role of advisor to the Grand Magistrix we will need to open a path for her.  It is true she will have some supporters but they alone cannot grant her the title.  There are other houses that Ly'leth must contend with. Fear and coercion are their tools. None dare stand against them openly, and we cannot win them over with favors and oaths.   Seek out Arluin. I trust he will have some ideas of how to proceed."
5916,"Break An Arm : The insurgents you marshaled gave me some bad news, <name>.The arcanists loyal to Elisande have reactivated the Arm of the Magistrix. The most powerful construct ever attempted, it raged out of control and decimated an entire district before it was disabled. Truly they must be desperate to turn it against us.The scouts have spotted it in the Crimson Thicket to the north. We cannot allow it to reach full power if we are to succeed."
5917,"A Vainglorious Past : The Heart's magic is attuned to Azshara's elite through powerful warding spells. If we tried to tap into its power now we would be met only with our own demise.However, there may be a way we can bypass the wards.Prince Farondis and his court were once a part of Azshara's empire, and still hold on to keepsakes of their sordid past. Among these is sure to be a Vainglorious Draught, said to further bind the queen's followers to her will.See if you can convince the court to part with a bottle."
5918,Sign of the Dusk Lily : Simply... astounding.I have not felt this clear of mind in so long.I am still weak... I need to rest. But first...<Vanthir gestures to the top of his cage with a trembling hand.>Show them that the Dusk Lily triumphs this day.
5919,"Lay Them to Rest : I would ask a favor, outsider.  As you step through the graves of ancient heroes, you will no doubt come across spirits of the restless dead, agitated by the Bonespeakers misdeeds. They must be returned to the earth where they are buried, so that they may be judged as well.  Take this bough - it carries with it the essence of the Runewood. Channel its power into a weakened spirit, and it will return to rest."
5920,"The Stuff of Dreams : This arcan'dor is one of an ancient species. They were not bred, but created. In them the arcane and primitive druidic magics merged into something greater than both.  The arcane will soon devour it whole.  We can restore balance, but it will require wild magic. Magic trapped in another realm.  You must enter the Emerald Dreamway and bring back the essence of life itself.  Only then can the arcan'dor find stability and begin to thrive once more."
5921,"Where They Least Expect It : The Legion's fanatical crusade leaves them spread thin. As they focus their defenses on Argus, we are free to tear into their forces on other worlds.  Travel through an Invasion Point on Argus and show the Legion that there is no hiding from death."
5922,"The Aegis of Aggramar : Now that it's out of the hands of the Legion, the Aegis should be brought back to Dalaran for safekeeping while the hunt continues for the rest of the Pillars of Creation.  It should be safe in the central portal chamber until the time comes when it is needed."
5923,"The Deaths of Chromie : It looks like we're going to have to stop all eight attacks on me. In one fifteen-minute span.  Even to me, that doesn't seem like a lot of time.  Still, if anybody can do it, it's us. Are you ready, <name>?"
5924,"Trial by Demonfire : We are out of time. I have reports that a pitlord has come to Meredil.   I have dispatched a strike force. We cannot let this demon flank our army here, nor can we let him find Shal'Aran. It is time to temper these recruits in a real battle.  Join our forces in Meredil, engage the demon, and help us ensure this new army of ours is not lost in its first conflict."
5925,"Spark of Genius : <name>, I require your assistance.  A recent energy signature tripped several detection relays I installed after that unfortunate incident with Sargeras.  Initial diagnostics suggest that these energies emanate from Hati, a legendary creature of lightning magic. This wolf was linked to the Titanstrike artifact, a weapon that proved instrumental in defeating the Legion!  Hati's spirit is still bound to Titanstrike's core, so I'll need your help. Meet me at my library in the Storm Peaks right away!"

5927,"Take Out the Head... : The Broken Shore swims with Legion filth, each demon deserving of a swift and merciless end.  But some are more insidious than the rest. Powerful combatants rallying others to their perfidious cause.  Strike down these demon champions and you will fill the hearts of their kin with fear and doubt. Break the Legion's spirit and we will break its back."
5928,"The Mail Must Flow : Due to all of the recent shenanigans, I'm running short on mailementals to sort letters.  It's a simple job, really - just toss the letter into the proper portal, where it will be whisked away to the far corners of Azeroth and beyond.  I like to make a little game out of it. How many can you sort in one minute?"
5929,"Leyline Feed: Ley Station Moonfall : <This leyline feed appears to be damaged. The large collector at the top is broken.The broken piece must be around here somewhere. There are rough scuff marks on the floor that appear to be made by something larger than the creatures inside.Much, much larger.>"
5930,"Halls of Valor: Odyn's Blessing : You are ready, <class>.Travel to Odyn's shining halls and offer the feast on the altar just inside. Mighty Odyn will then set his gaze upon you - you must pass the ancient trials of the Valarjar under his watch.Only then will you receive Odyn's blessing."
5931,"Secrets of the Axes : Battlelord, I have a request. Find me inspiration! An axe whose form has seen a truly astounding amount of battle, wielded by one of the world's most powerful warriors. Both weapon and owner forged together in the crucible of war.  Find this hero and their weapon, and convince them to come here."
5932,"A ""Noble"" Event : The invitation appears to be for an exclusive fox hunt. They plan to hunt Volpin, a rare, elusive fox somewhere in the Broken Isles.  Perhaps we can take advantage of this?  We need to gather more information about this hunt, but we should do so without alerting the Nightborne to your plans. Your champions can act in your stead and further  investigate where the hunt will be."
5933,"A Trial of Will : Upon the highest point of the plateau above, you will find the archive device for the Trial of Will. Seek it out to learn what awaits you in Thorim's Peak.   Be on your guard, outsider. The one called Skovald has left behind many of his army, and they will no doubt be unfriendly."
5934,"The Grimoire of the First Necrolyte : This ancient tome appears to be the spellbook of Sataiel, the first necrolyte.  Within its pages of curses and cantrips, you discover instructions for a ritual that Sataiel was concocting to empower Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester. She calls this ritual, ""The Rite of the Executioner.""  The site was chosen and prepared, but Sataiel met her unfortunate end before she could proceed.  Perhaps you can pick up where she left off?  First, you'll need some skulls."
5935,"The Seal's Power : The Nightwell is so overloaded that they could not spare anything for this seal. Instead, they are borrowing power from the ley lines.  I have traced one of their power sources to Kel'balor. We should head there immediately so I can determine how best to disable this barrier.  Yes of course I said ""we."" Surely you do not expect me to go without my bodyguard, do you?  I shall meet you there!"
5936,"The Ancient Trials : <As the raven stares into your eyes, an odd voice fills your mind.>  I know who you are, champion, and I know what you seek.  Come to me, if you think yourself truly worthy."
5937,"Self-Fulfilling Prophecy : In my life, I have witnessed many visions. Some filled me with hope... others, with despair.  Victory over Kil'jaeden lies within our grasp. I have foreseen it. But visions only show us where our path might lead. They require effort to become reality.  That effort falls upon your shoulders, <name>. You have done much, but more is needed. Fight on the battlefields of the Broken Shore and forge a destiny free from the Legion's grasp!"
5938,The Valewalker's Burden : The seed is awakening. Without power it will quickly wither and die.  We must carry the seed out of here and plant it somewhere safe.  I am not strong enough to bear this burden. But you... you are brimming with power. I can sense it.   Please take the seed.
5939,"Cursed to Wither : So Cedonu said he saw nightfallen going into Leyhollow?I don't like the sound of that.Grandfather seems to be holding his own, but the archmage and I will keep an eye on him. You go investigate our caves."
5940,"A Call to Action : <As the raven stares into your eyes, a familiar voice fills your mind.>  Champion, I require your aid. It seems Helya has shown her hand.  Steel yourself then come to me."
5941,"Power Grid : This station has fallen into disrepair. The circuit is broken, and to mend it we must recharge the seals in the central chamber.Both a high potency current and low potency current are needed for each seal. Direct the currents to point at the same seal, then engage the seal.Me? I shall supervise. You are the help, after all."
5942,"A Summons From Moonglade : <name>, Your presence is requested at Moonglade at once.We are preparing for a ritual of great importance and will require your assistance.I will meet you there, so please come with haste."
5943,"Lost Knowledge : We are indeed familiar with the Nightborne's magic, but we were never allowed access to the Heart. It was a right reserved only for the Queen's favored.However, we can still learn how to properly tap its magic.Thousands of years ago, a Nightborne scholar studied the Heart and documented his findings in great detail. He was executed and the scroll of his writings banned, but the Nightfallen secreted it away in their escape.If you obtain the scroll, we can help you."
5944,"The Seat of the Triumvirate : Even with the Sigil of Awakening in hand, the Crown cannot save us until it is whole.That is why we must enter the Seat of the Triumvirate, even knowing that L'ura awaits us there.This is a dire task, one that I would not ask if it were not completely necessary.We will descend together. Come."
5945,"Fire At Will : Look out there, the wings of the bats fill the sky. We must offer what ranged support we can, but our hands are full here.It looks like the Legion has not yet destroyed all of the artillery batteries. If you can get to one, you should be able to show those flying fiends the Light."
5946,"Ahead of the Game : The watcher Yotnar keeps the vault, and he is a fickle one. Challengers come from far and wide seeking the trials, but the watcher chooses not to see.  If you wish to catch his eye, show him you are worth being seen.  Some of these challengers await in camps throughout the Valley of the Sword. Bring their heads to Yotnar, so that he may see them, and you."
5947,"The Splintered Fleet : Preparations have been made, and we are ready to set sail.  We must strike out at once. Do not dally, or you will be left behind."
5948,"The Mysterious Missive : <On the body, you find a missive emblazoned with the seal of the Army of the Light. If the messenger was killed to prevent the letter's delivery, its contents must be of great import.>"
5949,"Fate of the Guard : <Thalrenus looks you over.>  You are not one of them.  The Nightborne came to our gates hours after the shield over Suramar fell. We thought them friends, despite our long separation.  We were wrong.  They poured into our stronghold and began the slaughter. We were unprepared. Though we fought, we were beaten.  The keep is lost. Our leaders have perished and their corpses lay in the streets.  Find them, give them their final rites.  While you search, look for survivors. Help them if you can."
5950,"Nath'raxas Hold: Rescue Mission : Your forces are adequately equipped for the mission to save my people from Nath'raxas. Order your champions to bolster my assault, and together we will dismantle the Legion's stranglehold over the region."
5951,"The Motherlode : Pst... Come 'ere! I just got a tip about a cave on this island that is a treasure trove of loot! This could be my biggest score yet.  Problem is, I uhh... sprained my ankle. Yeah, I would be right there with you battling those demons to get this treasure, but I shouldn't be putting any weight on this leg of mine. Shucks.  How about you go check on this cave and report back to me. I'll mark your map where the cave entrance is. I've been told it's pretty hidden, so you've got to look around."
5952,
5953,"Moose on the Loose : There's been chatter around the hunters' lodge about a crazed moose that is terrorizing the basin.   I've never laid eyes on the beast myself, but they say its antlers are illuminated with magic.   Where other lesser hunters have tried and failed, you will prevail, and collect me a one-of-a-kind trophy!"
5954,"The Highlord's Return : I have a missive for you from Kor'vas, as well as instructions for getting you there.I can teleport you to them to begin the fight, but you will need some Nethershards to force your way into the Twisting Nether.When you have enough, speak with me and you can begin."
5955,"Sizing Up The Opposition : No doubt your High Exarch will fret at the news that we lack the resources to assault Antorus. He is not used to believing his vaunted Army of the Light to be inadequate.  His pride is no concern of mine. While he plots a new strategy, I will bathe the ground in demon blood.  Go. There is much to be done before we can achieve our final victory."
5956,"Maiev's Trail : The fortress grounds are just up ahead. There is a large area to search, but if we split up, I believe we can cover a lot of ground.Search the prison cages, the forge, and the guard tower for any signs of Maiev. I will check the upper ramparts and meet you on the other side of the keep."
5957,
5958,"Trail of Echoes : The Nightborne could prove powerful allies against the Legion. We must aid this Thalyssra if we can.  We should be able to find her by tracking her magical echoes, the same way I found her distress call.  I can teleport you near the location where she recorded that message. From there, you must search for ripples in the very fabric of the arcane itself.  My wand should do the trick. Follow the sparks it creates--they should lead you to places where Thalyssra used her magic."
5959,"A Hero's Weapon : I'm pleased to say that the improvements to the crucible are complete!When you are prepared, we shall use it to unlock the true potential of your weapons!"
5960,"Gurgl and the Bandit : We've got all the pets back except Gurgl. <name>, we need to get that pet back for Breanni.  Stringfellowe saw a nook where we think the leader of these pet poachers is hiding out.   Let's get 'em!"
5961,"The Fangs of Ashamane : I have to admit, Verstok was right. The shrine was too easy of a target for the Burning Legion to attack. Still, he's gone and the Fangs are with him.We're going to have to track him down for you to recover the Fangs. I should come with you but I have to stay with my people should we be attacked again.Here, my companion Ebonfang has a sense of smell like no other. He will be able to guide you to wherever Verstok is hiding. Also take this shell, through it we can communicate.May Elune guide you."
5962,"Arcane Thirst : My people have subsisted on the Nightwell for millennia. Ancient mana is our lifeblood - without it, we become... well, you saw them out there.  <Thalyssra holds her flask aloft, gently shaking free the last precious drops.>  I'm afraid I have been rather reckless today.   Already, my senses are dulling. Without magic to feed upon, I will turn.   Please... find me something to feed upon... anything..."
5963,
5964,"Soul Prism of the Illidari : Alas, I will not burden you with the location of the master's soul just yet, <name>. First we must craft a soul prism powerful enough to hold the master's boundless chaotic energies.To do this I require lingering soul fragments from powerful beings found across this world. Bring me enough and I will craft a soul prism capable of holding the soul of the master - at least long enough to transfer into the naaru."
5965,"Runes of Rending : My brother and his cultists are engaged in some kind of ritual at the far end of the cave. I tried to intervene, but my brother has left magical wards to block the way.  If you can find a way past them, we may be able to stop him in time!"
5966,Army of the Light : Assist the Army of the Light by completing 4 world quests.
5967,"Tempering Darkness : I do not doubt Senegos' plan, but I do have some concerns about the Heart's volatility, especially when combined with nightmare energy.Despite its name, Blood of Sargeras is often used as a tempering agent by master craftsmen. I believe it would work for our ritual as well.You should keep an eye out for it during your travels - we'll need a substantial amount to ensure that everything goes smoothly."
5968,"Felborne No More : The Felborne have begun to expand their grasp beyond the city's reach. A camp to the east in the Crimson Thicket is of a particular interest to us. Their outpost leader, Valthis Ama'ran, serves Andaris directly.Now is the time to put our withered training and Oculeth's device to the test. We cannot allow them to advance any further, <name>.Head for the camp and use the orb to sever the head of the beast. The time has come to begin our advance."
5969,"Bjornharta : The afterlife leaves the dead hungry for the delicacies of their former lives. For the vrykul kings, none such offering is prized more than Bjornharta - a celebratory feast of an engorged bear heart.   The bears of the Runewood eat well, and have long been prized for their tender meat. Hunt them and find a suitable heart of offer to the ancient rulers. They will not be able to resist such an offering."
5970,Blood and Gold : The challengers gathered in the Valley of the Sword have brought with them offerings to the watchers of the vault.   It might be a good idea to take some of these offerings with you to help in appeasing Yotnar.
5971,"Shift Change : This is as good a chance as we are going to get to rescue Verene's daughter.  Here is how this is going to work.   You are going to wait here for the guard to pass by on their way to their guard shift. Look for something to hide in.  <Silgryn marks a spot on your map.>  You will know the guard by their bright red armor.  Follow closely, but not so closely that you are seen. It may be necessary to kill the guard when you reach your destination.  The child's name is Korine. Good luck."
5972,"Bindings of the Windlord : With Thunderaan risen again as the lord of Skywall, there may indeed be an arrangement you can make in exchange for those wretched implements. But one binding is of no use on its own.  Return to me with both bindings, and with powerful enough ore to bind them, and I will arrange your audience with Thunderaan the Windlord."
5973,
5974,"The Delicate Art of Telemancy : I hadn't the time to gather my instruments before fleeing the palace. I came here to salvage some equipment.  This old workshop is actually several rooms connected by teleporter pads.  Elisande's goons are already scouring the place looking for me, but from here I can alter the teleporter network and keep them moving in circles.  You go in. I'll monitor your position and ensure the teleporters work normally for you.  Find these two parts and bring them back!"
5975,"Ly'leth's Champion : Tal'ashar is an honor duel.  If I lose, then I must forfeit my title to Coryn Stelleris.  <Ly'leth smiles gently.>  That is why you are going to fight for me.   I will grant you a more powerful disguise for this task, and together we will put Coryn in his place.  Speak to me when you are ready to battle on my behalf."
5976,Cutting off the Heads : Erdris Thorn was a key commander of Ravencrest's forces. To hear him confusing us for the Legion fills me with a great sadness. He will be a difficult foe to defeat.  We must stop his squad leaders from forming up for a focused assault on Bradensbrook. Defeating them should delay his forces long enough for us to find and deal with him. Let us begin our grim task.
5977,"A Found Memento : <The trinket's fine brass exterior is inlaid with intricate filigree, though much of the detail has been battered by rocks and waves. Clearing away the grime and salt encrusting the clasp, you manage to open it.  It is a compass--or was, at least. The glass face is shattered, the needle bent, unmoving.  Set into the lid is a portrait. The paint is faded and waterlogged, but the subject is unmistakable: the face of a young Anduin Wrynn.>"
5978,
5979,"Return to Karazhan: Cubic Cynosure : Drat! The ancient mana doesn't seem to be working. I need to think the problem through, focus and...Wait, that's it! Focus! We need to focus the energy of the ancient mana to activate the cube.I've heard tell of a mana wyrm in Karazhan with the means to focus its powers. Might be just what we need!Watch out, though. My sources tell me this wyrm is humongous!"
5980,"To The Hills : It is said that a fragment of Ursoc's spirit, his fury and rage, remained within the claws after his death. Only those who have attained mastery of discipline have any hope of wielding them without being overwhelmed by the bear lord's fury.<Lea looks intently at you for a moment.>But you are no novice, I can see that clearly.Very well, draw water from the moonwell on the northern edge of the grove then come find me. I'll await your arrival within the broken stump of Vordrassil in Northrend."
5981,"Intolerable Infestation : While we purge Legion filth from the Broken Shore, the fiends maintain their hold on nearby lands. Their presence can no longer be tolerated.  The fetid strongholds of Faronaar and Felsoul Hold infest Azsuna and Suramar. Choose an attack point and cut a swath through their insidious ranks.  Return to me with demon blood on your hands, then we can resume our campaign to drive Kil'jaeden from the Tomb."
5982,
5983,"Order of Incantations : The barrier shielding the tower can only be opened by activating the imbued gems in the correct order. The order is only known to Xylem and his inner circle of apprentices. No others have yet been able to decipher the code, and mistakes are met with deadly consequences.  The aspiring apprentices spend a lot of their time around the tower. Some may have seen or heard something that might point to a solution.  Let us hope, for your sake, their information proves valuable."
5984,"The Emerald Nightmare: In Nightmares : We must do what we can to ensure that the Nightmare never again festers within the Emerald Dream.The aberration known as Il'gynoth lies at the heart of the corruption - a living, writhing manifestation of the horrors you will encounter at every turn of your journey.I ask that you ensure its destruction, along with the Nightmare Lord himself... Xavius.Once the deeds have been done, bring a small piece of each to me. We can study them to figure out just how the Nightmare grew so quickly."
5985,
5986,"Forging a Key to the Past : The armory key fragments are gathered, and the dendrite clusters should provide just enough power to reforge the key.This should not take long... assuming it works. It has been a long time since I made one of these!"
5987,"Lady Lunastre : Our friend Ly'leth contacted me. She requested that you meet her atop the Grand Promenade as it overlooks the city.  Have your disguise ready just in case, <name>."
5988,
5989,"Arcane Communion : All of Kel'danath's experiments to connect with the withered failed, and some even made them more dangerous.  Until he found Theryn.  His arcane essence - the very soul of the shal'dorei - had been touched by something special. But what?   By weaving my arcane essence together with Theryn's, I can create an empathic bond. This communion will bare his soul to us all - or what's left of it.   We need only to feed him mana, and lots of it, in order to begin."
5990,"Thalyssra's Abode : While you were busy in the city I reached a roadblock in my withered research.   I feel I am close to overcoming this barrier, but I'm afraid I cannot do so without some more advanced tools.  I hid among my possessions an item called an Arcane Amplifier. It does precisely what its name entails.  It is more than likely that the Magistrix ordered my estate dismantled. If the Amplifier remains, it will be in fragments.  Recover the whole, if you can."
5991,
5992,"Enemies Everywhere : Hold a moment, <name>. While I look into this orb of yours, why don't you look into something for me?I have long suspected an infiltration of Dalaran but after an embarrassing encounter with a local florist I've withheld my accusations until I'm absolutely certain.Have you noticed citizens among us that seem just too mundane? Almost inhumanly so? Spies, serving dark masters, watch and wait until our backs are turned. Root them out, but try and keep it quiet."
5993,"Halls of Valor: Securing the Aegis : The Felskorn may be broken, but the head of the beast yet lives. The God-King will still vie for the Aegis if left unchecked.  You, who have completed trials upon trials, must not let this come to pass. You must claim the Aegis over Skovald's broken bones!  The Halls of Valor await!"
5994,"An Old Ally : I was on my way to Ambervale in hopes of finding an old colleague.  Arcanist Kel'danath was fascinated by the withered. He studied them for years hoping to calm their feral nature or even cure them.  When one of his subjects escaped and ran amok in the royal gardens, Kel'danath was ordered to cease his research and kill all withered in his possession. He refused, and was exiled.  If Kel'danath lives, he is near withered. And withered are drawn to old settlements like Ambervale."
5995,"The Burning Heart : The loss of Xe'ra is a blow, especially to Turalyon. But even the Light Mother could not be allowed to force destiny upon us.  I wish Illidan had found another way to refuse her... but I too have had choices imposed upon me by the naaru.  This must not distract us from our mission. Now that we have the Army of the Light survivors with us, it is time to press our attack.  We need a foothold on the Antoran Wastes from which we can assault the Burning Throne. It is time to deprive Sargeras of his prize!"
5996,"And They Will Tremble : There will be consequences for what has transpired this day.  For now, you should return to Thalyssra. Tell her that we have avenged Margaux and that the Dusk Lily has announced itself to all of Suramar.  There will be many more deaths before this is over, rest assured, but this is a death that will teach others like Durant to tread more carefully in the future."
5997,"Bring Home the Beacon : The conduit we need is in the Arcway, and security in the Arcway has doubled since your last visit.  Our only reasonable option is to teleport your strike team directly in.   This is a long-range teleport to a non-anchored destination. In other words, it will be hard.  Take this beacon and survey the commons in Suramar City, then return the beacon to me so I can analyze the results.   This will help me teleport you as close as possible to the conduit!"
5998,"Pressing the Assault : <With this Pillar of Creation safely secured, it is time to take advantage of your momentum and continue onward after the next.><You recall that your order has gathered information that would aid you in your journey - looking it over once more before setting off would be wise.>"
5999,"Into the Night : What we do this day, we do for Azeroth. For the countless souls lost to the Legion's foul crusade.  Once you are ready we will take the Vindicaar into the very heart of the Legion.  Argus awaits."
6000,Leyline Feed: Ley Station Aethenar : <This leyline appears to be damaged and needs repair.Several large chunks of the main column are missing and arcane energy is crackling in the gaps.The elementals nearby seem to pick up debris and absorb it into their bodies as they move around. Maybe they have the missing pieces...>
6001,"A Royal Summons : Well met, $p. I have come on behalf of King Anduin Wrynn.My crew is preparing for a special mission, and the king would like you to join us. Please review this official summons and, if you are satisfied, return with me to Stormwind Harbor.<Rogers hands you a sealed envelope.>"
6002,
6003,
6004,
6005,"The Lone Mountain : Our sources tell us that a Highmountain tauren emissary has recently arrived in Dalaran. We don't know his intentions, but his people could be an invaluable contact in the region.Khadgar is greeting the emissary at Krasus' Landing in Dalaran - you should seek him out."
6006,"Friends On the Outside : You have done well for us here, but it is time for you to return to Thalyssra.  There is a teleporter pad nearby that has gone unused in recent years. See if you can reroute it and return to her that way.  Oh, and before you go:  <Vanthir hands you a wrapped bottle of Arcwine.>  Take this to her, with my thanks for sending you. Let her know that your efforts helped replenish our Arcwine supplies and reunited a mother and child.  We are grateful beyond measure. Farewell for now."
6007,"Shal'Aran : The chamber beyond may be the perfect hiding place, now that its guardian has been dealt with.  Come with me."
6008,"Battle of Snowblind Mesa : Your timing is fortunate. Our forces at Snowblind Mesa report seeing the Underking above ground.What is more, he is lightly guarded, and has the hammer with him. Thanks to your efforts, we can meet them in battle.Meet us at Snowblind Mesa and let us take the fight to Dargrul together."
6009,"Silence in the City : There is a troubling silence from Suramar City this day.Oculeth just informed me that the teleporter to the Waning Crescent has gone dark. He is not able to reach Vanthir, nor am I.While I am hesitant to believe something dire has happened, I do feel this warrants investigation.Speak with Oculeth and see if he can transport you to the Waning Crescent. We need to find out what happened."
6010,"Lyana Darksorrow : <Your fellow Illidari, Lyana Darksorrow, floats captive in stasis in front of you; her soul slowly draining into the harvester crystal.>  <In order to release her from stasis, you will need to destroy the soul harvester.>"
6011,"Saving the Guard : The Moon Guard were once among the most powerful sorcerers on Azeroth. Most assumed their ranks demolished after the War of the Ancients, but it seems they have managed to survive in their ancient stronghold in Suramar!I believe they could be valuable allies in our quest if they still oppose the Legion.<name>, if you can save what remains of the Guard, I will work to convince the Council of Six to lend us additional aid."
6012,"Masquerade : Our family commands great respect in this city, thanks to my father. Through my network of contacts, we can organize the citizens to prepare Suramar for Thalyssra's return.You must walk among the nightborne. You must earn the trust of our friends and foes alike.You must become someone else.<Ly'leth hands you a shimmering party mask.>Put this on Anarys."
6013,"The Sixth : Greetings, warlock. I speak on behalf of the Council of the Black Harvest.With the Legion invasion upon us, it is painfully clear that our only hope is to grow stronger. The council plans to tap into the Twisting Nether and call forth more powerful demon allies. The ritual is ready, but we are short one number.No doubt you have heard of the fate that befell Kanrethad Ebonlocke.You will be his replacement. Do you accept?"
6014,"Darkheart Thicket: Fallen Power : Once we have the proper implements we can use the Heart to infuse great power into your artifact. We need only a source.Deep within the Darkheart Thicket lies the ancient Oakheart, once a great and mighty protector of Shaladrassil. He has regrettably fallen to the nightmare like so many of his kin.As the darkness within him has taken root, an essence of the corruption has manifested. I ask that you recover the essence so that we may draw from its power, and put noble Oakheart to rest."
6015,"Begin the Assault : The battle for our world has been hard fought, but with the power of your weapon and the combined forces of Azeroth, we have driven the demon invaders back at every turn.  Now we stand once again upon the Broken Shore, poised to do that which we previously failed to accomplish. Let us not forget those who sacrificed everything to give us this chance.   Our first objective is to take the hill before us, so that we may build a stronghold. Steel yourself, <name>. The assault on the Broken Shore begins now."
6016,"The First Trial of Ursol : The Legion...<the glow of Ursol's eyes begin to shine intensely>Yes... I remember clearly that day long ago when my brother fell. Countless demons fell beneath his claws until, through the overwhelming numbers of the enemy, he was overtaken. My brother was the true spirit of the bear!You must prove to me that the spirit of the bear resides within you as well."
6017,Staging Point : That is quite a corridor you and our allies have punched through the city. It will be difficult to hold but it will cut a wedge in Elisande's forces.Oculeth has been busy redirecting a telemancy beacon to this location but wanted to give you the honor of activating it.
6018,"To The Dreamgrove : The portal to the Dreamway is open and it is here where our paths must part. The Moonglade remains vulnerable to the attacks of the Burning Legion and I must ensure it is well defended.I'm entrusting you with the mission to Val'sharah, <name>. Archdruid Greathoof is the leader of the druids there. He is wise in the old ways and will provide us invaluable assistance.The Dream can be dangerous so I will send Keeper Remulos to guide you. Meet with him upon the other side."
6019,"Keepers of the Hammer : The Highmountain Tribes had intended to pledge our allegiance to your forces. We know war has come with the Burning Legion.However, we have been betrayed from within and must now ask for your aid.A great relic, the Hammer of Khaz'goroth, was stolen from our people by the vile drogbar.We need your help in recovering it."
6020,"Moths to a Flame : No doubt you have noticed our guests.  I have watched them for a time and seen how they are attracted to the tree. I do not know if they are harmful to our sapling, but we cannot take that chance.  Collect a handful of the insects and bring them to me. I will examine them and determine if they are to be left alone."
6021,"Magic Message : For the last 10,000 years, the elven city of Suramar has been sealed in an arcane barrier, much like Dalaran once was.That barrier has come down.Since then, waves of magical energy have been emanating from the city like ripples in a pond. It was in these waves that I sensed a pattern.A spell, encrypted among the chaos.I have recreated the spell here. It's not dangerous, but beyond that... I have no idea what it does!"
6022,"Into the Fray : The Burning Legion has beaten us here, but so too have the Illidari. It looks like the demon hunters are holding their own, but just barely.  Come, let's put that weapon of yours to use. I'll figure out our next move while you crush the Legion."
6023,"Vengeance Point : On my way here, I ran across a squad of demon hunters headed northwest to Vengeance Point. You can bet the Legion will try to stop them from establishing a forward position.  I spoke to an elf named Izal Whitemoon. Not the friendliest sort, but I'm sure she'd be grateful if you lent the Illidari a hand... whether she admits it or not."
6024,"Making the World Safe for Profit : Might I ask a small favor, my friend? These creatures in the tide pools to the east are starting to frighten me. Our efforts to trade with them have been rebuffed at every turn with aggression. This is not good; neither for running a business, nor for profit.  Sadly, I must admit the time for talk has come to an end.  Might you be willing to serve as my representative in dealing with the denizens of Mak'rura and their ""queen""?  I can assure you that your efforts will be rewarded commensurately."
6025,"The Hammer of Khaz'goroth : <Now that you have defeated Dargrul the Underking and have the Hammer of Khaz'goroth in hand, it is time to place it in Aegwynn's Gallery in the lower chambers of Dalaran.>"
6026,"The Acolyte Imperiled : Truthfully, the Council knows little of Agatha, but she is more than just your average succubus. She has many allies within the sayaad, and is known to command armies of imps that swarm and overwhelm her foes.  To seek her out is folly, but Ritssyn Flamescowl repays his debts.  Come, let us examine what manner of fel powers this little mage of yours was stumbling her way through..."
6027,"You Scratch My Back... : Much better. I knew I could count on you, my friend. Allow me to return the favor.I know how you can destroy the large mana collector pylons. We shall save your dragon yet!The pylons only work against ground targets, yet they're defenseless from above. Send your whelplings at them, my friend. The whelplings can fly where we cannot.Trust me."
6028,"Arkhaan's Prayers : <As you near the statue, a somber voice fills your mind.>""You must resist the shadow's pull. Come to me, brothers and sisters. Be whole within the Light.Let Arkhaan show you the way home.""<The rest of the message is garbled, though the nearby broken seem to be gnawing on pieces of the statue.>"
6029,
6030,"Grave Robbin' : I am not a grave robber, but is it technically grave robbing if the treasure is sitting on a field of bones? It's not like it's buried or nothin'. I'm just gonna sit this one out, just in case."
6031,"Neltharion's Lair: Presentation is Key : Odyn will demand a feast worthy of the ancient trials you must complete; a feast's merit begins not at the great beasts piled upon it, but at the dish used to serve it.Deep beneath Highmountain lies the former lair of Neltharion - you may know the infernal drake better as Deathwing. You will find remnants of the adamantium plating used to hold his molten skin together in the deepest recesses of his lair.They will form a fine dish for the feast."
6032,"In Deep Slumber : This bed will be yours for the deep slumber that will usher you into the Dream.Once you are comfortable, drink of the moonwater you brought. I will guide you from there.Quickly, now - with every passing moment G'Hanir slips further into darkness."
6033,"The Last of the Last : We need help.Since the fall of Deathwing, we dragons have lost nearly all of our power. To make matters worse, we can no longer bear eggs.My whelplings are the last of the last.I need you, champion. Help defend my whelplands, and I swear to you, the blues will be at your side when you need them."
6034,"The Underking : Mayla already chased the Underking into his cave. That is something we tell our children never to do.Reckless child, but hey, who wants to live forever? Let us join her in battle."
6035,"Chromie : <name>. Is that you?I'm convinced that something unusual has happened in the timelines. I need your help!Come find me at Wyrmrest Temple, in Dragonblight, and I'll show you."
6036,"Professionally Good Looking : The archmage has recently locked himself away in his tower. If you wish to enter, you'll need help from some of his apprentices. I'm afraid you won't get it dressed like that.  Xylem has a thing for... outfits, and his apprentices use them to show rank. If you wish his apprentices to help you, you'll need to appear their superior. Such is their desire to impress the archmage, many of his apprentices will battle each other for the best pieces.  I think you know where this is going."
6037,"Building an Army : We must keep our eyes on the future. There will come a time when we will need an army.We've proven that the withered are not completely beyond redemption. They can be taught, and molded.I want you to be their combat trainer, <name>. Come with me. We can use the nearby ruins as an arena to hone their abilities."
6038,"We Meet at Light's Hope : We must put Highlord Tirion to rest.There is but one place suitable for a paladin of his caliber... Light's Hope Sanctum, a secret bastion of the Light hidden beneath our chapel.Paladins the world over will join us for the ceremony. I know Tirion would want you there most of all."
6039,"Survey Says... : It is time to establish the first secure connection in our teleportation network.Take this beacon to the Ruins of Elune'eth above us and survey the area to find a suitable location.Once your survey is complete, place the beacon and I will anchor a connection to it from here."
6040,"The Skies of Highmountain : When you are ready, join me at the base of Thunder Totem.I would be honored to have you at my side as my tribe once again swears its allegiance to the young Mayla.Together, we are Highmountain!"
6041,"Ephemeral Manastorm Projector : Oculeth's theory is sound. Reckless, but sound.  A small warp-field could trap and excite ambient mana in the conduit, thus creating a manastorm similar to when the arcan'dor fell out of balance.  I can build a device to generate the warp-field, but I need materials.  Specifically, warp-resistant alloys - such as the armor plating of high-end security constructs in the noble district.  Those constructs are deadly. If anyone owes you a favor, now is the time to call it in."
6042,"Isle Hopping : <Victory in hand, you know there are still Pillars of Creation that must be recovered if the Legion is to be defeated once and for all.><Your order has identified uncharted regions of the Broken Isles that still house the remaining Pillars - looking over the information would help focus your next effort.>"
6043,"Assault on Azsuna : The demons strike at the heart of our existence, posing a threat to all who inhabit our lands.Remove the threat before it is too late."
6044,"Cleansing the Mother Tree : We must save the Mother Tree at all costs.I believe I know a way.The world tree Nordrassil, atop Mount Hyjal, was born from an acorn of G'Hanir. We can use the sacred waters surrounding its roots to purify the corruption.If we take the Dreamway to Mount Hyjal's summit we should have enough time to complete the cleansing ritual before G'Hanir falls completely to the darkness."
6045,"The Nighthold: Darkness Calls : Before we perform the ritual there is one last thing I must ask of you, <name>.You must finally bring Gul'dan to justice.No more of his lies, his deceits, or his trickery. None of it can save him now.Take one of his conjured eyes when you're done. Using his power for good will be a fitting end."
6046,"Whispers of a Frightened World : Champion, Magni needs your help!The Speaker has a message for you, perhaps from Azeroth herself. He seems to be having trouble understanding her, but I'm sure he can explain everything better.He said he was in Sholazar Basin, in Northrend. He should be contacting you shortly."
6047,"Mistress of the Claw : The great forest guardian, Ursoc, gave his life for this world ten thousand years ago. After the guardian's death his claws were hidden away, safe from any who would use their power for evil.Lea Stonepaw and her Druids of the Claw consider Ursoc their paragon and dedicate their lives to following in his example. If anyone would know where the claws reside, it would be Lea.She and her Druids of the Claw reside in the Tel'Andu Barrow Den just to the north."
6048,"Spiders, Huh? : I feel like they're still crawling all over me. I squished one egg and all of a sudden I'm covered head to toe in baby spiders.  <Shivers>.  That treasure is just sitting there now. The next guy better not be arachnaphlipic... arachnaphonetic? Arachniphant? Afraid of spiders!"
6049,"Aalgen Point : You wanna hold territory on this chunder puddle of an island, right? Right. That means linkin' up with camps on the outskirts, mate.   I know this bloke called Heidirk. Scrappy fella, loves to get into the thick of it. Headed out to the eastern coast with those drakes of his.  Have a look for him. Remind him he owes me a pint or two!"
6050,"Maw of Souls: Retrieving the Svalnguard : The Svalnguard was once Odyn's shield; it is said that it hid the Halls of Valor from the endless darkness below his realm.Helya, who was cast from the shining halls long ago, stole The Svalnguard and keeps it on her accursed ship, the Naglfar.You must board the Naglfar, defeat Helya, and retrieve The Svalnguard - it will make a worthy tribute for Odyn."
6051,"All In : It is time to put our plan into action.  Oculeth will send you, Arluin and myself into the Arcway, where we shall trigger a manastorm in the Nightflow Conduit.  Valtrois will stay here and prepare Shal'Aran for a massive jolt of arcane power - hopefully enough to satisfy the arcan'dor.  $p... We have a saying... ""To lead is to stand alone."" It means only those who bear the weight of leadership can truly appreciate it.  Thank you for standing beside me. In truth, I do not feel alone."
6052,"The Nighthold: Delusions of Grandeur : Grand Magistrix Elisande and her cohorts have lost their minds - they truly believe that allying themselves with the Legion will end in anything but their own demise!They are too far gone to save, I'm afraid, but they still have powerful items that we can use to help us infuse the Heart of Zin-Azshari with their power.In your assault on the Nighthold, ensure you recover the mad construct Trilliax's power core, as well as the spellbook of the Grand Magistrix herself.Good luck."
6053,
6054,"Preserve the True Future : I know how this looks, <name>. I'm not asking for your help simply because I don't want to get killed.  I need your help because this isn't how I'm SUPPOSED to die. I will die - I've seen it! - but it happens much later than this. Besides, meddling with the timeways for personal reasons - well, it goes against pretty much everything my dragonflight stands for.  Let's stop all four of the dragonshrine attacks. That should do the trick."
6055,
6056,"An Urgent Gathering : A critical decision must be made, <name>.The Legion devastated our forces at the Broken Shore. The mightiest army this world has ever known was reduced to cinders in moments.We must gather those with the conviction to save our home. Travard of Tyr's Guard and Orik Trueheart have each made plans to do just that, but we must not let them walk alone.I ask that you seek them out and guide them to Krasus' Landing so that we may make this decision together."
6057,
6058,"Scattered Memories : <As your fingers trace the elegant symbols on the page, a voice dictates the words in your mind.  It seems the nightborne have elevated even simple note-taking to a sorcerous art.  Arcanist Kel'danath was definitely working in this area. There must be more of his notes scattered around.>"
6059,"Dark Revelations : I'm not going to let Cordana Felsong get away with this. There is no way in hell I am going to let that warden witch turn my people.  As for Nightglaive... I will NOT suffer a traitor to live!  Are you with me, <name>?"
6060,"Sympathizers Among the Shal'dorei : Elisande's decision to welcome the Legion into Suramar earned her plenty of enemies, though only some of us were bold enough to openly defy her.We have allies in the city - we just don't know how many.I need you to make contact with a spell-fencer by the name of Silgryn. He is loyal to our cause, and has been lying in wait since our failed coup.He patrols the western edge of the city. Address him by name and tell him our cause is not lost!"
6061,Two If By Sea : The draenei have crafted a vessel to take us to Argus safely. They are gathering the invasion force on Azuremyst Isle as we speak.   We will join them there by sea. The Legion is no doubt keeping a close eye on the gateway to their world. We must retain the element of surprise.  Let me know when you are ready.
6062,"The Rivermane Tribe : What has happened here requires more time than I have to explain. In short, our tribes have scattered in the wake of the attack that left the Hammer of Khaz'goroth in the hands of the barbaric drogbar.  Even now the drogbar are raiding the Rivermane tribe, and I have too few braves left to send to their aid.   We need a hero. Please, go to Earthmother's Bounty and lend what aid you can."
6063,"Not Their Last Stand : I've been watching you- you are not with them.  <Ivanel coughs quietly.>  I am not long for this world, but there is one thing I would have you do while you are here.  The hippogryphs here still fight bitterly to defend their home and their companions in the Moon Guard. They have not accepted that the Guard is no more.   Please... send them away. Let them know there is nothing left for them to fight for here."
6064,"The Death of the Eldest : I will do what I can to stabilize him, but I will need your help.The small amount of energy he has left is coming from the mana pool he rests in.Follow the whelplings' lead. Dropping ley crystals into the pool gives him a bit of energy - buying him a few more breaths.They seem to be getting the crystals from inside that cave to the north."
6065,"The Perfect Opportunity : I have heard whispers from Suramar City.  Recent unrest in the city has prompted the nobles to seek another advisor to fill Elisande's council. Such positions are rarely offered and hotly contested.  This is the perfect opportunity and Ly'leth is the perfect candidate. Fate smiles upon our cause!  I know she has historically chosen to avoid such politics and maneuvering, but we must now ask her to join the fray.  Seek her out at the Waning Crescent and ensure her victory."
6066,"Huln's War - The Nathrezim : I am fully occupied here organizing my troops and planning for the battle to come.  While I would like to slay the Dreadlord Tichondrius myself, I will allow that honor to be yours, Huln Highmountain."
6067,"Redistribution : I would imagine you thought I would simply have wine to deliver.  <Deline chuckles.>  If it were that easy, his people would not be starving.  <Her expression becomes serious.>  These... loyalists, shall we say, enjoy abundance. They dance to the Magistrix's whims and so they have all that they need.  There is no Arcwine shortage. The Magistrix created one to keep us in line.  They will not miss a few bottles. They have plenty.  Search the square and bring as much as you can carry back."
6068,Waning Refuge : We have done all we can here.Let us get everyone into the boat and get out while we still can.We have bought time for the others but nothing more.
6069,"Leyline Feed: Elor'shan : <The leyline feed appears to be intact and undamaged, but is not functioning. An infusion of Ancient Mana should be enough to render it operational again.>"
6070,"Get to High Ground : It is no accident that Dargrul attacked the Rivermane in force. It is their farms and their pastures that supply food for the region.Please, get Jale to Thunder Totem. With luck, Mayla will have reinforcements to send to the area.We will rally the survivors here and follow as quickly as we can."
6071,"Last Stand of the Moon Guard : This is all that remains of the Moon Guard.  Take a good look.  We are but a shadow of our former selves, and we have the Nightborne to thank for our demise.  For now there is nothing more we can do. If we want to live, we must leave immediately.  Retribution can wait."
6072,"The Mage Hunter : And with that, we have what we need to recreate the ritual... however flawed it may be. It must be conducted somewhere highly visible so that word reaches our target swiftly.I've heard reports that the Legion is heavily invested in the Faronaar region of Azsuna. An excellent place to begin a ritual they won't want us to complete.The chances of us dying horribly are exceptionally high."
6073,"Eminent Grow-main : You have done very well, <race>.   All that is left is to combine their blessings into the ritual bundle and imbue the Moonwell. Once that is done, Mayruna will add a little water from a purified Moonwell and this land will be protected so long as we inhabit it.  This is a momentous occasion, my friend. You bear witness to a sacred rite not often performed in the company of strangers.  I will let you do the honors- simply place the ritual bundle into the sacred waters and we will do the rest."
6074,"Court of Stars: Literary Perfection : Out of all the books, why that one?! Oh, Mother Moon, I am but a trusting fool.I apologize, you have no idea what I'm going on about.I lent my first edition copy of ""Wards, Sigils, and the Nightborne Way"" to a dear friend - well, former friend, I should say - just before the betrayal.As fate would have it, there is an incantation in that book that I will need for my part of the ritual.Please retrieve it if you can, but be careful - it is quite valuable!"
6075,"Feeding Shal'Aran : With leyline energy feeding in from Anora, this chamber can begin to awaken.It will be a slow process, and we must take care to mask this activity from our enemies, a process which itself requires enormous effort and focus.Furthermore, there is the conundrum of actually consuming the mana in this form. A stream too weak is not enough to provide sustenance - too powerful and it would vaporize us.There is much work to be done yet. For now, let us examine the feed."
6076,"The Deceiver's Downfall : Once he was as a brother to me. Then he bartered the soul of my world for his own power. Hounded my people across the stars. Twisted my son into a monster.  Now he has come to oversee the final assault on Azeroth. To end this world as he has countless others.  Kil'jaeden.  We must ensure he does not escape our grasp this time, <name>. Storm the tomb. Break the Legion's hold. End the Deceiver's reign."
6077,"Azoran Must Die : You won't have much time before the Legion is aware of your presence on the ship.When the alarm is raised, countless Burning Legion forces will attempt to board the ship through this portal.I will not let them succeed.I will guard this portal from enemy reinforcements until you return. It is up to you to slay Azoran and lay waste to his ship.We don't have much time... you must attack swiftly and without mercy."
6078,Invasion Point Offensive : The invasion points are key to cutting off Legion reinforcements to Argus. Defeating their armies within the lesser portals will allow us to assault larger invasion points and extinguish the Legion presence within.
6079,"Cry Thunder! : You have proven yourself an ally of the Thorignir and we will lend you our strength. I would ask one last favor of our new champion, though.   The dragon who guided you to me awaits his vengeance against the vrykul. Together I wish for you to show these Drekirjar what it means to cross the Thorignir. Be they Felskorn or not, their malice has caused suffering to my brood. Their toll must be paid in blood.  Speak to Vethir when you are ready."
6080,"Subject 16 : <It seems Theryn is still under the arcanist's spell. In the absence of Kel'danath himself, a live subject could be useful in helping Thalyssra unravel his research.>"
6081,"The Vindicaar : Everything is prepared for our assault. We need only establish the beacon to transport us to the vessel.  Once the beacon arrives, place your hand upon its surface to board the Vindicaar, the instrument of our retribution."
6082,"A New Invention : I have been experimenting with technology that allows you to alter the structure of beasts, specifically with how they look."
6083,Light's Exodus : Prophet Velen and the others have gathered within the Vault of Lights below. There is an entrance just down this path.  We should find the Prophet at once so that we do not stall the invasion.
6084,"Trial of Valor: The Once and Future Lord of Shadows : While tracking the master's physical body proved challenging, we were able to locate it in the Nighthold of Suramar. Our intelligence reports that Gul'dan is making final preparations to the Nightwell in order to use its power to usher the soul of Sargeras into Illidan's body.The only way to stop that from happening is to put Illidan's own immortal soul back.Take the Soul Prism of the Illidari and venture to Helheim. Defeat Helya and use the prism on Illidan's soul! Return it to Light's Heart."
6085,"Maritime Law : Good <sir/madame>, a moment of your time. My fellow salvors and I could not help but notice yon ship that ran aground in the storm last night.  A pity about its crew.  <Mr. Shackles makes empathetic gestures.>  Still, the law's the law. The maritime code is quite clear on the matter. If you find yourself out that way, would you mind terribly checking in on my acquisitions scout, Looper? I would have expected him back for tea some time ago."
6086,"Ancient Mana : Without the Nightwell to feed upon, my comrades and I will have to live off the land itself.Ancient mana from the underground leylines can reach the surface in many forms, most commonly as crystals or gems.<Thalyssra picks up a small stone and, whispering words of power, traces a rune upon it with her fingertip.>This stone will glow when ancient mana is nearby. Please gather as much as possible! It will be a precious resource in the weeks to come."
6087,"Making the Rounds : As you can see, we have spared no expense in showing our support of your great quest.Final preparations are being made - come, walk with me."
6088,"Preparing to Move : Thanks to your tireless efforts the Heart of Zin-Azshari is ready to withstand the full power of the Legion.The final destination in our journey has stood defiantly in front of us from the moment we began - the Nighthold, now home to none other than Gul'dan himself.Before we move on the hold, we should reunite with the Moon Guard in Shal'Aran - we still have need of their skills, and I would wager that they have unfinished business with their former brothers and sisters."
6089,"First Contact : Time to put your new disguise to the test.Your first contact is Vanthir, a merchant from the common district. He is in the Grand Promenade today visiting one of his suppliers.Tell Vanthir to pay me a visit regarding a shipment of dusk lily bulbs. He will understand.Beyond that, we will need time to prepare. You should return to Thalyssra.<Ly'leth hands you a corked bottle of faintly glowing fluid.>Give her this, with my regards. We will call upon you soon."
6090,"Greymane's Gambit : The Skyfire is prepared to make way to Stormheim. Should we become engaged, I will require my best fighters on the front line.  This includes you, <class>."
6091,"Destroying the Nest : We have to put an end to Tugar's plot. These abominations must be destroyed, as well as their source!I think I know where. A group of neutral drogbar had a settlement nearby, but were pushed out by concerted demon and fel tauren attacks. That must be the place.Go there and stop their fel monster production at its source!"
6092,"Closing the Eye : We have received reports from the apprentices at Xylem's Tower that they've been able to use the remant of Xylem's portal to pinpoint his location.  We have orders from the Council of Six to open a portal directly to him, though whatever magic he's channeling on the other end is powerful enough to allow us to only keep it open for a brief window.  The apprentice, Joanna asked I give you this message before you proceed. Speak to me when you're ready."
6093,"Hunger's End : I am weak. The hunger is devastating, my friend. I understand now why your dragon rests in these pools.<cough, cough>I came to warn you but... it looks like I was too late.I hear him outside now. Ael'Yith... is... here..."
6094,"Time to Collect : Hey there, pal. My sources around here say you had a run-in with the Sixtrigger brothers. I'd imagine you're not very happy with them?  Let's just say we're not exactly friends either.  So I'll tell you what. How about I let you in on some intel about their current location? Maybe they might have an unfortunate accident, you follow?  Oh, and bring some friends. They're not exactly the easiest of targets."
6095,"Lucid Strength : We have everything we need, <name>.Once you are ready, raise your artifact and channel its energy upon the Heart of Zin-Azshari to safely absorb the power stored within the nightmare essence.I will use the blood you provided to make sure the ritual stays safely contained."
6096,"The Brother's Trail : We must reclaim the Silver Hand before those with evil intent can seize it. To free it from its wards, we need relics called the Sparks of Tyr. I have one, as does my brother, Galford.He journeyed to Northrend to seek aid from the Tyr's homeland, but has not returned.I must ask you to find him, and his Spark."
6097,
6098,"Leyline Feed: Kel'balor : <This feed appears to draw power from the leyline in order to become fully operational.You should be able to imbue it with mana, but it will take a few minutes to draw enough leyline energy to accept the infusion.Beware, for creatures may notice the surge of arcane energy...>"
6099,Arkhaan's Plan : Arkhaan remembers. He remembers something that will... yes... will save us.Follow Arkhaan. Isolon calls! We will offer soft words to the Light. The Light will banish the darkness.<Arkhaan eyes Alleria warily.>Arkhaan will watch that one closely.
6100,"Battle for Stormheim : Your efforts have destroyed the Legion's forces upon Shield's Rest, yet they continue to press their assault.  There is only one way to end this - you must venture into the midst of our foe, find their commander, and remove his vile head!"
6101,Fate of the Queen's Reprisal : <This is the kind of intelligence that should be shared. Perhaps someone at the Greyfang Enclave on Dalaran will know what to do with it.>
6102,"Feeding the Rebellion : More nightborne flee Suramar every day to join our cause.  Our ranks are swelling, and with the aid of great heroes like yourself and the armies of the Horde and Alliance, our chances have never been better.  Help me hand out more fruit of the arcan'dor - each one is a life free from slavish dependence on the Nightwell!  Afterwards, we shall speak on how best to assist our new allies in their siege."
6103,"A Heavy Burden : With Ashildir's judgment, your final trial is complete.   But even Valhallas can wait, for now we must eat! Being dead works up quite an appetite.  Come now, bring some of that fish to roast over the fire. It is far too heavy for me to carry."
6104,"Secrets in the Underbelly : So my brother has gone off to perform some ritual with these cultists? That explains why he left, but still not to where...  Wait! This letter mentions some of these ""Nethersworn"" cultists seeking reagents in the Underbelly. Perhaps we still may be able to find them if we hurry!"
6105,Kel'danath's Legacy : Kel'danath discovered something incredible - the power to subdue and even control the withered.  I will pick up where my old friend left off. We shall see to it that he did not die in vain.   Perhaps in the end we can even find peace for the wretches who have been left to a fate worse than death.  I will need more subjects. Take Kel'danath's spellstone and use it to subdue more withered.
6106,
6107,
6108,"Rendezvous : There is much to be done before this nightmare can end, but we need to regroup before we draw more attention from the Legion.I managed to retain a signal crystal during the crash used to call transport beacons from the Xenedar.With luck, we should be able to use it to establish a link between here and your forces as well."
6109,"Stormheim's Salvation : It would seem that the portals we destroyed down here were not the only ones. Demons still pour in from the top of the Gates of Valor's edifice, summoned by the God-King himself!  I cannot face Skovald alone. Come, champion, let us take the battle to him and end this threat!  For Stormheim!"
6110,"A Hunter at Heart : Addie's one heck of a writer, but I've never seen her hold a rifle. She's keen on learning how to hunt, but who's ever heard of a gnome hunter?   You seem to have a knack dealin' with amateurs, so maybe you'd be willin' to let the gnome tag along on a hunt? She could learn a thing or two by shadowing someone with your skill.  Ya best start off with some small game. We don't want the lass to get discouraged."
6111,"Eye of Azshara: The Tidestone of Golganneth : <Now that you have defeated Queen Azshara's Wrath and have the Tidestone in hand, it is time to place it in the Portrait Room of the Chamber of the Guardian in lower Dalaran.>"
6112,
6113,"We're Treasure Hunters : I have a feeling you're just using me for tips on where all the best treasure is. From now on I'm naga tell you anything. Did I say, ""naga"" just then? I meant to say, I'm not gonna to tell you naga. I mean nada! Darn it!  Okay. Seems you got me on this one. I'll tell you what, fetch me whatever is in that chest near those naga freaks and I'll make it worth your while."
6114,"Battle for Val'sharah : From the very start of these attacks I've felt as though the demons knew our plans, as if they anticipated our every move. If we are to put an end to this we must focus our attacks at the heart of the beast.  Your efforts have shown these battles are not won by bravery alone, but willingness and sacrifice. I ask that you stand on the battlefield once more among allies to bring this madness to an end."
6115,"Lieutenant of the Tower : All of your instincts were correct. Gul'dan raised Lord Ravencrest, and his ghostly army, from beyond the grave. Now, they serve the Legion, protecting secrets within the tower.Although Ravencrest commands from above, Lieutenant Desdel Stareye operates the prisons.He tormented me these past few moons, but I did not yield.<Maiev runs a finger along her curved blade.>His life must be ended."
6116,"Havi's Test : I could sense your power the moment you arrived in this land. You carry great purpose and a heavy task.  Know that the Aegis of Agrammar rests in the high halls of the All-Father. Only if you prove your valor, can you claim it against your foe.  Many trials must you face for this, but first I must know your strength. My stew is incomplete, and my old bones couldn't carry the ingredients up the hill.   You look like you have a good arm. Will you help an old man finish his stew?"
6117,
6118,"The Child of Light and Shadow : It is time, <name>.Xe'ra is returned to us. We have Light's Heart. We have her Chosen One.Come, let us restore her. Let us forge a bright new path against our foes.Speak to me when you are ready to begin."
6119,"The Skyhorn Tribe : The Skyhorn people are some of the greatest pathfinders and hunters this world has ever known.They are a proud people, but should be willing to listen to reason.If the roads feel unsafe, you may ask any flight master in Highmountain to fly you there.Please, $p, go to their leader Lasan and remind him that only together, we are Highmountain."
6120,"Wings of Liberty : When the Felskorn assaulted the nest, the Thorignir fought bravely to save our brood. But their demonic allies proved too much, and many of us were captured.  Even now they work to corrupt my brothers and sisters to turn them to their side.   Please, outsider, free them from this fate!"
6121,"We Have a Problem : We have a problem, <name>. The Legion has come to Eredath.When you claimed the Sigil it was as if we announced our presence to all of Argus. The eyes of Antorus are firmly upon us.Just wait. It gets worse.Velen took Captain Fareeya and her forces into the Arinor Gardens area to search for the Crest of Knowledge. To my knowledge, they are all now behind enemy lines.Come with me to the Conservatory. We need to bring Velen and the others back before it is too late."
6122,"Special Delivery : Verene's child has gone missing. I can guess what happened, but I need to be sure.  Most guardsmen use couriers to relay delicate information. In this, magic is strictly the province of high ranking officials.  Take this blade. Do not touch the cutting edge. Use it to silently waylay the couriers and collect any correspondence they carry.  With any luck, the missives will tell us exactly where to find the girl.  We guards know everything, after all.  <Silgryn offers you a winning smile.>"
6123,"Focusing Our Efforts : The Nightfallen in Suramar were once a part of the Nightborne, but have been exiled by their former brethren and cut off from the Nightwell.I believe they could be valuable allies in our quest if you can turn them to our side. I know only that they have gone into hiding somewhere in Suramar.Afterward, seek out the Moon Guard in the northern reaches of Suramar. They, too, could be valuable allies in our cause... if they still oppose the Legion as they once did many years ago."
6124,"Blood Debt : You have proven a much greater ally than the Bloodtotem ever were. With my focus crystal, my wounds are healed. I fear Frag was too far gone to revive.  Torok and his Bloodtotem will suffer for what they have done to us. Let's pay them a visit before they can mount an attack against the cave of my people."
6125,"A Village in Peril : The corpse of Darcy Heathrow lies before you pierced by several arrows and knife wounds.In one hand she clutches a note, written with a feeble hand, that reads:""The dead march on Bradensbrook.Help us, please!"""
6126,Do The Thing! : Mrglrg! Mrlglr mrgllrg.<Phin gesticulates wildly>Mrlgrlg glrglmglr mrlglrg. Rglrgmrg mrglr glr. Glr! Gmrlgrmlg mrglmrgm...<Phin looks at you expectantly.>
6127,"Jarod's Mission : Since Maiev chased after Gul'dan at the Vault of the Wardens, her sisters among the Wardens have been searching far and wide for her whereabouts.With so few Wardens remaining, I volunteered to join the search. I hope I will find sign of her within Black Rook Hold.The fortress will be well guarded, and I will need help to break through. Help me find her, and I will reward you handsomely."
6128,"Securing a Foothold : Alleria and I have scouted this area before, alongside some of our best soldiers. We stationed encampments on either side of our current position, but I fear they will have come under heavy attack. They need reinforcements.Our first order of business is to set up a teleportation beacon directly below the Vindicaar. From there, we will have access to both fronts.Speak to Romuul when you are ready to head down to the surface."
6129,"The Bloodtotem Tribe : The Bloodtotem are led by Torok, a volatile but useful tauren chieftain. He is wary of outsiders, but I believe you have already met an emissary to their tribe--Oakin Ironbull--whom you rescued at Riverbend.  Use that small thread and you may be able to bring the Bloodtotem back into the fold. Highmountain needs them if we are to defeat the drogbar and reclaim the Hammer of Khaz'goroth. Be on your guard, <name>."
6130,"The Day That Chromie Dies : Oh, <name>! I was just thinking about you! Talk about being at the right time in the right place!  I was just reviewing some aberrations in the timeways, when I discovered something... unexpected. Something not-so-great.  I'm going to die in the near future. Bad times.  I was just about to jump ahead and see if I can figure out why, how, who... but I'd feel better with |5<race> like you by my side. Care to join me?"
6131,"Essence of the Light Mother : This is a crucial moment, <name>. Our campaign must not lose momentum.  Though she has fallen, I still sense Xe'ra's presence all around us. The Light that shone within her heart can yet be a source of strength for our cause.  No doubt the loss of Xe'ra has deeply wounded Turalyon. I will do what I can to ease his troubled spirit while you gather the vestiges of the naaru that remain."
6132,"A Floating Ruin : We knew the Legion to be a formidable foe, but recent events demonstrate that we do not possess the necessary strength to continue. We have come too far to fail at this critical moment.I know of a relic on Eredath, my ancient home, that may be our salvation. We must take the Vindicaar beyond the surface of Argus, to the floating ruin suspended above us.Perhaps there we will find the salvation we so desperately need."
6133,"A Gift From the Six : <name>, without you some of the Legion's strongest agents would still be roaming Azeroth, threatening to undermine all that we've accomplished in this war.Such a deed merits more than mere recognition.If you would accept it, we would like to formally reward your heroism in the face of such darkness with a portion of our power."
6134,"The Sword of Kings : The first king of the humans, Thoradin, performed many acts of heroism and valor. While on a personal quest near the end of his reign, he stumbled upon the tomb of my brother Tyr... and the grave-prison of the monstrosity he died fighting. Thoradin unintentionally awoke the beast and gave his life to keep it from escaping.  It is Thoradin's sword, Strom'kar, that has kept the monster at bay. Retrieve it and finish what Tyr and Thoradin started. Kill Zakajz the Corrupted."
6135,"A Ring Unbroken : Our defeat at the Broken Shore was decisive. The Burning Legion has a foothold on Azeroth, and the best of our armies are retreating in tatters.The elders of the Earthen Ring have called an emergency council near the heart of our world - the Maelstrom. <name>, your triumphs throughout Azeroth and Draenor are the stuff of legend. We need you more than ever.Join me at the Maelstrom. Stormcaller Mylra will be flying there shortly - find her at Krasus' Landing here in Dalaran."
6136,"When Dreams Become Nightmares : Now that we have Ursol's blessing, we can safely pass the magical wards and reach the claws' resting place!Now, we must pass into the Dream. Lay down before the Shrine of Ursol and drink of the moonwater you brought earlier and your spirit will drift off into the dream.Be careful, the Dream can be a dangerous place."
6137,"I'm Not Lion! : I've hunted many exotic beasts in my day, but I've never seen a lion like the one I encountered while scouting the basin.  The beast's amber eyes locked on mine, luring me closer. I was helpless to this predator's enchanting gaze. It was only when the lion pounced did the stupor break.  I've told Hemet of this magical beast, but he laughs. I'm not lying, <name>! The lion exists.  If you find the beast, bring me a trophy of your kill, and I'll reward you handsomely."
6138,"The Blessing of the Watchers : As is your due for passing the Trial of Might, I will grant you the blessing of the watchers.   Furthermore, to aid you in your trials to come, I will bestow upon your artifact the power of the vault's keeper. May it serve you well in your time of need.  Speak to me when you are ready to receive this gift."
6139,"Scouting the Breach : If Ly'leth's information is accurate, there is a breach in the Sanctum of Order that could be our only way into the Nighthold.  No doubt they have magically sealed it - take Valtrois and protect her while she examines the seal. She is an exceptional talent, and I have total faith in her ability to break whatever enchantment they have cooked up.  Valtrois has her own methods of getting into the city and will meet you inside the Sanctum of Order."
6140,
6141,Cursed Tome : Much of the elven writing in the tome has been singed by fel fire.The head of the curators in Dalaran is renowned for his restoration skills.  Perhaps he can treat the tome to bring it back to legibility.
6142,"Nullified : The magus in charge of the defenses here is powerful. Perhaps too strong, even for the both of us.Fortunately, the sin'dorei know a thing or two about magic. The mage's barrier is strong, but we are clever.He has somehow channeled enough energy into his staff to power another set of defense portals, but he has left it out of his sight. Bring me the staff and an energy source from one of those constructs. I should be able to create just the thing we need to take that shield out."
6143,The Scythe of Souls : Let's head to the other side of the stand. We will release the demon souls one by one and get the answers that we seek concerning Lord Illidan.  The Scythe of Souls will ensure that we do.
6144,
6145,"The Silver Hand : Too many know of its location, the tomb must be closed forever. First, we must reclaim the hammer.  Tyrosus has lent us a force to aid in the recovery of the hammer, and some of my order will meet us there as well, but I fear even that may not be enough. I'm glad we'll have you with us.  Take the portal to Dalaran Crater, then fly to Tirisfal Glades and meet us. I've marked the location on your map."
6146,"The Hunt for Illidan Stormrage : Allari the Souleater, an oracle of the Illidari, has been on the hunt for Illidan's soul for quite some time. She now believes that she has discovered its location and requires your assistance in its recovery.Find Allari at Illidari Stand in Azsuna and aid her in any way possible.If Sargeras truly plans to use Illidan's body as a vessel for his own return then returning Illidan's soul to his body is integral in preventing the dark titan from returning to our world!"
6147,Battle Worms : Snowmane Village behind us was caught completely off guard by the scale of this attack. I will hold the drogbar line here so the civilians have time to prepare their evacuation.The drogbar are using worms to burrow their way to the surface and deploy their troops.I am giving you command of our forces. Use them to slay these worms and cut off enemy reinforcements.
6148,Court of Farondis : Assist the Court of Farondis in Azsuna by completing 4 world quests.
6149,
6150,"Repaid Debt : The Moon Guard fought against the Legion many years ago, during the War of the Ancients. Their intimate knowledge of our enemies would be invaluable to our cause.They have remained in Shal'Aran since you saved Thalrenus and his kin. Shall we pay them a visit and see what they can do?"
6151,The Way Back Home : Hello? This is Chief Telemancer Oculeth. I see you have emerged safely!I am locking in your location as we speak. I will need you to activate the beacon on your end so we can establish a teleportation link.Got it? Good.
6152,"Removing Obstacles : <class>! Interested in earning some coin?The jarl of Jandvik is missing and two headstrong whelps are vying to take over leadership. I should be the next jarl, not them!I want you to enter Jandvik and defeat Calder and Eynar in mortal combat.I would not normally put my trust in an outsider, but this situation requires the aid of someone like you. Jandvik would condemn me if I were caught with their blood on my hands.Meet me in the center of Jandvik when the deed is done."
6153,
6154,"The Huntsman's Creed : Through the glorious wonder of science, I have managed to keep the Thunderspark powered precisely for this purpose.  All you need to do is get to the Temple of Storms and absorb Hati's essence into it. Just... kind of point it in his general direction.  Oh, and do keep in mind that this is only one part of Hati. You may run into a few... technical difficulties before he's subdued enough for the absorption protocol."
6155,The Speaker Calls : Magni sent for you to meet him in the Krokul Hovel. He has found something that he believes could help us overcome the Legion's infinite armies.  We need every advantage we can muster if we are to see this war through. You should seek him out.
6156,"Stormheim : It is good we found you, <name>!  Nathanos Blightcaller, Champion of the Banshee Queen herself, sent for you in Dalaran. He made it sound urgent. He should be waiting for you in the Violet Citadel.  Make haste!"
6157,"Seed of Hope : Thalyssra was wise to send you in search of the arcan'dor, though she underestimates its power.She will learn - as will the others.But it will take time. And with hunger gnawing at their very souls, the Nightfallen will need your help to survive."
6158,"Reinforce Light's Purchase : Now that we have established a foothold, we need to rendezvous with our soldiers in the field.We have an Army of the Light encampment to the south, near where the Legion is keeping their strongest warriors in some sort of stasis.Alleria went to scout the area. Find her, and see what information she has gathered."
6159,"The Reluctant Queen : Wait, how is it you know about my parentage? Be careful what you say around here, there are those who would hunt me down if they knew my bloodline.  I don't know who you are, nor do I believe I'm part of any prophecy. However, if you seek to undo the damage my father has wrought on the Tideskorn, then I feel obliged to assist you.  Meet me in Valdisdall, <class>. From there we can make our way to Skold-Ashil and request an audience with Eyir. Perhaps she can shed some light on this prophecy."
6160,"Felstorm's Plea : You may not know me, but I need your help, <name>.  Meet me in the Violet Gate and I'll explain everything.   Make haste. I fear we have little time."
6161,Insurrection: An Elven Problem : The Alliance and Horde have arrived in Suramar. First Arcanist Thalyssra needs your help in providing an introduction.Meet with Thalyssra in Shal'Aran.
6162,"A Feast Fit for Odyn : It is customary in the Halls of Valor to feast after battle is finished. Presenting a truly glorious feast to Odyn from beasts worthy of his throne will show him your determination to earn his blessing.Acquire flank meat from Thunderhoof in Stormheim, Spinesever's spine in Highmountain, and the finest cut of steak from Leytusk in Azsuna. They will make a feast worthy of the great battle to come."
6163,"Leyline Feed: Falanaar Arcway : <The leyline feed appears to be intact and undamaged, but is not functioning. An infusion of Ancient Mana should be enough to render it operational again.>"
6164,
6165,"Throwing Shade : That was Locus-Walker. He taught me all that I know about the Void, and he still has more to teach me.If he is here, then the ethereals' presence only intrigues me further. I had thought him the only one of his kind, but now that I have seen another tangling with the Void...Come, we must play his game if we want to learn what he knows. He appears to have gone toward the Umbra Hollows to the north."
6166,"Vault of the Wardens: Borrowing Without Asking : The elusive Wardens run an immense secret prison facility deep underneath the mountains of Azsuna housing all manner of terrible creatures.Perhaps... 'used to run' is more accurate.This presents us with a unique opportunity. The wardens used powerful containment crystals to encase each prisoner in their cell. If any of them still remain intact, we could use one to safely contain the Heart's power.They certainly won't be needing them."
6167,"The Fate of Val'sharah : Malfurion, my love.... My heart breaks for him, but I cannot follow where he goes.I have sworn myself to Elune, my goddess, to defend her temples and lands with all that I am. I cannot stand by while my order is in danger.May she keep you in her graces, Malfurion.<Tyrande turns away, eyes glistening with tears.>"
6168,"The Lost Advisor : You may as well assist me while you are here. I require a potion to be made, one that will set things right.I must conserve my energy until my task is finished, lest I become like these miserable wretches scrabbling at the cobblestones. There is coin in it for you, since I will not be needing it soon.The harpies around here cannot resist cliffthorn. It is what drew them to Tel'anor in the first place. You should find plenty just outside this building."
6169,"Temporal Investigations : I knew the shal'dorei dabbled in time magic, but this is simply incredible...  Elisande stopped time on our entire army!  Come, let us investigate. Perhaps there is a way to break the spell - or at least discover how it is being maintained."
6170,"The Nexus Vault : If the Ethereum managed to capture Azuregos, then they are more powerful than I imagined.   We have not always seen eye to eye, Azuregos and I, but he is still my kin. Since you seek to put an end to the ethereals and claim Aluneth, I ask that you also free my brother from their grip.  With the Surge Needles destroyed, the shield has dissipated. The Nexus awaits, <name>."
6171,"A Taste of Freedom : We are as ready as we will ever be. Once we put Valtrois' plan into action, we can attack the Sanctum of Order and put an end to Andaris. She will never expect us to have trained our withered against fel magic, and her hubris will be her downfall.  Come, let us feed the people one last time."
6172,"The Mage Tower : Well done <name>. In testament to the efforts of all forces fighting here, we have come together to complete the construction of the Mage Tower.  All that remains is for you to inspect our work, and complete the construction."
6173,"The Unseen Blade : Stormwind is too important to fall to the Legion, and I don't trust Shaw or his SI:7 goons to take care of the Hand on their own.The two of us will have to handle this while there's still time.Use extreme caution. The entire city is on edge from murmurs of the cult's activities, and we're already kill on sight.The other Shadows spoke highly of your skills. Are you in?"
6174,"The Masks We Wear : Many nightborne had pinned their hopes on Thalyssra deposing the Grand Magistrix. Since she disappeared, dissenting voices have grown silent.  We must spread the word, discreetly, among the populace. Ly'leth Lunastre will be a perfect ally in this. She is a socialite with many connections, and she is no friend of the Legion.  Ly'leth hosts a masquerade party at her estate where rumors are traded like coin - and brandished like daggers.  Let us invite ourselves in."
6175,"Battle for Azsuna : The vile demon commanding the assault must be stopped. I can get us close, but once we're there I'll rely on you and your allies to help bring down the demonic forces."
6176,"The Wisdom of Patience : The horrors you braved in the thicket are only the beginning. Within the Emerald Nightmare you will face the very heart of the corruption that threatens the stability of all life on Azeroth.But not just yet.We have not yet managed to permeate the magic protecting Xavius' sinister realm. Once we have, however, you should return here; there is still much to be done."
6177,"Tomb Raidering : I said to myself over and over, ""Don't go near the citadel. Don't go near the citadel."" But what did I do? I went to the citadel. Almost had my hands on that sweet treasure chest before I got chased off by a bunch of crazy demons. I made it out of there with just my helmet and my life!"
6178,
6179,Presence of Power : The demons appear to be harnessing an ancient power within the Temple itself. They've managed to twist and corrupt these sacred grounds with fel magic.We must remove the demonic presence before we press our final advance.
6180,"Shriek No More : Papa loved this village. He'd never hear of leaving, even in these dread times.Before he died, he told me what attacked him: a monstrous falcon we call Rotbeak.You're fighting these undead, aren't you? Will you avenge my father? If so, you can find the beast northwest of here, patrolling our western route to the sea."
6181,"An Unexpected Message : Ah, Felo'melorn. I am familiar with this weapon.   For ages the Council of Tirisfal attempted to recover the blade. Its control over the primal forces of fire would be devastating in the wrong hands.   As luck would have it, an associate of mine, Archmage Modera has recently uncovered some information on this artifact. This crystal contains a message from her.  I suggest you start your search there. The portal over there will bring you back to the city."
6182,"The Hunt : This hunt is yours to lead, <name> - a select few Illidari will join you to make sure Varedis meets his end.The rest of us must stay behind; a small team will have the best chance of making it to his hold undetected.We will meet you at Krasus' Landing to see you off when you are ready."
6183,"Breaking the Seal : <As you behold the relic, Thalyssra's voice echoes in your mind.>  You found it! But it is sealed away tight.  Search the room for a way to break those seals."
6184,"Off To Adventure! : Oh I'd love to go see if that story is true! But Pops is too busy stuffing his gut and being a grouch to let me go do any real exploring. He even told me that I can't leave the village unless I have a guardian!Is Pops for real? I can protect myself just fine!Say, would you be my guardian? Please, get me away from this boredom and you will totally be my hero!"
6185,"Planning the Assault : Thanks to your tireless efforts the Heart of Zin-Azshari is ready to withstand the full power of the Legion. The final destination in our journey has stood defiantly in front of us from the moment we began - the Nighthold, now home to none other than Gul'dan himself.We just need a way inside.I am working fervently with the rest of the Council of Six to secure an entrance. Once we have, we should reunite with the Moon Guard in Shal'Aran - we still have need of their skills."
6186,"Ascending The Circle : Now, you are more powerful than ever! Truly, you are a druid without equal, <name>.I sense that Malfurion has arrived. He will certainly want to know of your accomplishments, but first, please walk with me a moment."
6187,"The Arcway: Rite of the Captain : Only a captain of the Guard may receive the power of our order - our ancient laws forbid otherwise.You must complete the rite of the captain.Traditionally, aspirants patrol the Arcway for three weeks without rest, the vast labyrinth putting their skills as a Guard to the test. Our laws must still be honored, but I believe there another way you may prove yourself.Elisandre's advisor, Vandros, has recently descended into the Arcway's depths. Kill him, and take his Eon Winder."
6188,"Either With Us : Thalyssra asks much of me, but our cause is worth the risks.  The title of advisor would grant us enormous influence. Information. Access.  I could change this rebellion. I could save so many lives.  I will need strong endorsement to ascend, though. There are many houses who stand with me by virtue of my family's name. Some are more hesitant.  Lady Aurore of House Astravar is the most prominent of these. Seek her out. Offer your aid in my stead.   Earn her trust and the rest will follow."
6189,"Archdruid of the Vale : Deep within our forest lies Moonclaw Vale.There you will find a reclusive group of feral druids charged with the protection of Val'sharah from any that would seek to disrupt the balance of nature.These druids are led by Thaon Moonclaw, the most fierce of the Archdruids.Seek him out. Let him know that Cenarius is in need of his aid."
6190,"The God-Queen's Fury : <class>t, the Kirin Tor have found a way to get you into the Halls of Valor to pursue the God-King's heir. Archmage Khadgar has asked me to stress upon you the importance of stopping Sigryn, as the prophecies hint that she may still be the key to uniting the Tideskorn against the Legion.  It will require an incredible amount of energy to teleport you directly to the Halls, so be sure that you are prepared. It may be some time before we can send you again.  Speak to me when you are ready to proceed."
6191,"Morale Booster : Things may look good from where you're standing, but, we're losing. However, do not fret, my little <race> friend. You can help.  Listen closely. Ooka Dooker, Ooker's sister, is back over yonder in the champions' cave making her world famous Fighter Chow. It'll do the trick and boost our team's morale.  All you have to do is to convince her to hand it over."
6192,"No Reason to Stay : Elisande's purge of the Waning Crescent came so swiftly that few could react. Many of my people are dead or taken.Some may have endured this atrocity. We need to make sure they are not left behind.I need you to search the houses nearby for any survivors. See that they flee before they are discovered. Reassure them that there is no reason to stay. Not here, not while Elisande's insanity reigns."
6193,"Oculeth's Workshop : We need to make contact with Chief Telemancer Oculeth, the man who developed Suramar's teleportation network.   Oculeth had a workshop in old Suramar, from the age before the Sundering. He may be taking refuge there.  <Thalyssra presses a small coin into your palm.>  If you find him, show him this. Hopefully you see him before he sees you..."
6194,"The Light and the Void : Alonsus Faol has been a valuable ally, and his instincts about you have proven true. I believe you are uniquely suited to assist in a matter that will bring a great force of good into this world.I must take you somewhere far from Azeroth to finish a task my people began long ago. Will you aid us?"
6195,"Reinforce the Veiled Den : The foothold you established allows us to check in with our field operatives.On our last mission here, we set up a bastion to the northeast. It should be defensible for now, but that could change at any moment.Illidan has gone ahead to assess the situation. I suggest you go there and see if he needs a hand."
6196,Felfire Shattering : A thin series of stone bridges connects the Burning Breach to Felfire Armory over Fiend's Run. The Army of the Light will stem Legion reinforcements while your people deal with the armory itself.  Work swiftly.
6197,"Sowing The Seed : Your weapon is ancient and powerful but it holds the potential to be so much more.Take this seed, it is all that remains of a forest that grew tall when the world was young. Plant it within the grove to the west and allow it to take root.With its power both it and your weapon will be far more than they are alone."
6198,A Re-Warding Effort : <This small device of elegant nightborne design crackles gently with arcane power.  Kel'danath's notes mention wards that keep the withered at bay. It seems he found some form of spellcasting that does not tempt their ravenous appetite for magic.  These may prove useful in your search for the missing arcanist.>
6199,"The Coast is Clear : I was on the last leg of a supply run when we were shot down! They took the pets, but the supplies are scattered over this stretch of beach.  I don't know what they're planning, but I know we gotta get our supplies. You an' me, we ain't subtle.... But Speedy IV... He won't cause all them pirates to go into hiding. He can get the supplies while Stringfellowe surveils the area from the air.  Speedy's fond of you, so chat him up and let's try to recover the smoldering supplies before they all burn up."
6200,"The Nightmare Lord : You arrived just in time, friend.Kagraxxis was moments away from sacrificing me to his master... I was certain I would perish.I am grateful, but we are not out of danger yet... Xavius has returned.The Nightmare Lord is here in Val'sharah, personally orchestrating the corruption of this land. My captor revealed as much to me before I was to be sacrificed.We must find Thaon Moonclaw and inform him before it is too late!"
6201,"They Have A Pitlord : The Feltotem are not the first to embrace the temptations of the Burning Legion. And they will not be the last.But in their arrogance, they have conjured a pit lord.Will you join us in battle against this beast? The power of your artifact and skill could prove invaluable against such a creature."
6202,"The Codex of Ra : The Thunder King conquered Pandaria using power stolen from the Titan Keeper Ra, known as ""Ra-den"" in the mogu tongue. If you truly seek to wield the relics of the Highkeeper, seek out his ancient edicts among the ruins in the heart of the mogu empire: The Edict of Stone, The Edict of Fire, and the Edict of the Storm.These pieces of the codex are scattered amongst the Guo-Lai Halls in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms, one in each wing."
6203,"Leyline Feed: Falanaar Depths : <The leyline feed appears to be intact and undamaged, but is not functioning. An infusion of Ancient Mana should be enough to render it operational again.>"
6204,"Note-Eating Goats : I've followed Hemet on all his expeditions from Stranglethorn to Nagrand to... Nagrand again, taking notes on his grand adventures and turning them into timeless literary tales.  But my heart is really in the hunt. I want nothing more than to put down the pen, and pick up a rifle!  Hemet promised to teach me how to hunt once I finish his latest novel, but the goats around here ate my first draft!  I have no hope of becoming a hunter if my manuscript isn't recovered."
6205,
6206,"Cubic Coalescing : Success! The cube's magic has been restored! I'm excited to see what it does!  Since you did all the legwork, you should have the honor of activating it. Care to give it a try?"
6207,"The Arcway: Opening the Arcway : Deep beneath Suramar is a defunct set of tunnels known as the Arcway. They were abandoned when a disaster disrupted the mana collectors operating there.   I know not what awaits you down there, but I do know one thing.  We are not the only ones interested in this place. Make enough noise and one of the advisors with whom I served under Elisande is sure to appear.  His name is Vandros. Slay him, if you can.  His death will be our victory, as we deprive Elisande of one more weapon in her arsenal."
6208,"Weapons of Legend : Three weapons... three worthy paths.Acquiring one such artifact will be the first step in battling the Legion. The weapon will grow in power as you wield it, so you must choose the one which will be the focus of your efforts, <name>.After a time, you will be able to pursue the other weapons. But you must decide which to seek first."
6209,"Feathersong's Redemption : I must confess I was not entirely honest with you, <name>. I meant to drink the potion and join my wife.And even she was taken from her rest... I cannot fail her again. I must live and do what I can to stop this coming storm to be worthy of joining her.Come, young one. Let us take care of the harpy matriarch and restore Tel'anor to its former glory. We cannot let this poison go to waste, eh?"
6210,
6211,"Cenarius, Keeper of the Grove : Ahh, Val'sharah.It has been an age since I have set foot in these sacred woods. Too long...Our work here is simple, <class>. We must call upon my mentor, Cenarius, and learn where he safeguards the Tears of Elune. With them, you will be one step closer to sealing Sargeras' Tomb and thwarting the Legion.You have many treacherous tasks in front of you. Consider your visit here a brief respite.Come, this will not take long."
6212,"The Gondolier : I need your help.  The wine you so graciously distributed to the needy was the last of my reserves. Without more, these people here will risk succumbing to their thirst, and eventually becoming withered.  I am dedicated to preventing this for as long as possible.  There is a woman by the name of Deline who owns and operates a small delivery service out of her gondola.  Find her, identify yourself as my messenger, and offer your aid in acquiring the next shipment."
6213,"In the House of Light and Shadow : The Tears of Elune are ready for you, <name>. I am uncertain what to do from here. Take the relic back to your order hall and try to use it on Light's Heart.Maybe make them touch? Honestly your guess is as good as mine.Let's hope this works!"
6214,An Impossible Foe : <name>! We have just received word from the Council of Six. They have found Agatha!  Modera asked that she be able to brief you through this image crystal.    Good luck!
6215,Moonshade Holdout : <Tampering with the relic has drawn the attention of some hideous creatures from beneath Falanaar.>
6216,"Ritual Ruination : Time for main event, friend! Gul'dan wants to begin his big ritual, cause end times for this world. Calydus confident getting the Scepter will stop that plan.Take this bat to Tomb of Sargeras, find ritual, steal Scepter. Oh... and get out!Calydus will help when he can! Good luck, friend!"
6217,"The Head of the Snake : Those naga have the Tidestone shards, <name>. They will soon be dragging them into their watery holes, away from our reach.It would be wise to take out their leaders before that happens."
6218,Commander's Downfall : A champion of the Legion is vulnerable within an invasion point! Track it down and destroy it before it can return to fight on Argus.
6219,"Crackdown : Thalyssra is right to be concerned!The network has not responded to my attempts to re-establish connection with the Waning Crescent. I do not know what happened, but given the circumstances I believe it prudent to investigate in person.<name>, would you do the honors? I will send you as close to the Waning Crescent as I can."
6220,"The Backdoor : This will take Mayla some time to adjust to.That being said, we should return to Thunder Totem.Just south of here is a tunnel that should take us through the old drogbar slave enclave and then to an opening beyond.We keep a small Skyhorn outpost there to watch and ensure nothing enters or leaves this vault without us knowing about it. They should be able to fly us back."
6221,"The Eagle Spirit's Blessing : The spear is linked to a spirit called Ohn'ahra. It has been tradition for us to speak with her and receive her blessing before going after the spear. She may also impart some knowledge.  If you would accompany me to Spiritwatch Point, I will summon the Eagle Spirit and ask for its blessing in the coming fight."
6222,"Ship Graveyard : I haven't told you that I was part of the original landing party when we lost almost everything.  I don't care what treasure is left there, I'll never go back to that beach. Never."
6223,"Disillusioned Defector : The atmosphere in the city has improved little, but we may find this to our advantage today.  Silgryn asks for you at the Terrace. It seems even Elisande's forces are fleeing before her insanity.  A defector has risen from the ranks and seeks to join our cause.  See that this individual is well received, <name>. We need all the friends we can get during these dark times."
6224,"Huln's War - The Arrival : Huln Highmountain is the origin of our strength as a tribe. He bested the Legion when last they threatened our survival and unified many disparate tribes.  Live his story, and you will know why his name imbues courage in the cowardly and sows fear in the fearless."
6225,"Seeking the Valkyra : We simply cannot risk another catastrophe like that; we have to protect the Heart against fel energy before we continue our work.The mighty Ashildir has proven willing to aid those who she deems worthy, and her master just may be able to help us protect the Heart.You should seek her out at the Vault of Eyir in Stormheim. I'll meet you there."
6226,"Recovering Stolen Power : My injuries will not kill me, but I cannot fight. I have my own idea of how to deal with the remaining Nightborne.  They destroyed our defense matrix as soon as they arrived. Surely one of them carries the spell focus necessary to reactivate it.  Find it, then go to a hippogryph. They linger throughout the Stronghold.  These loyal beasts will take you to the skies and take care of the rest."
6227,"Feline Frantic : Greetings, stranger.  <Mayruna bows to you.>  We arrived from Val'Sharah a short time ago with hopes of settling here. Our journey was not easy and we are weary.  These owlcats have made a mess of our camp, as you can surely see. Would you be so kind as to assist us with cleaning up?  Then perhaps you can help us establish a new moonwell!"
6228,"Havoc: The Thieving Apprentice : The Focusing Iris has been stolen from the Dalaran Vaults! The thief was a mage of some skill, but we've been unable to track him.  Fortunately, the thief dropped a note from his master, addressing him as one of his ""apprentici."" I know of only one mage who uses that particular pluralization - Archmage Xylem.  I'll need you to investigate. In Azshara you will find his tower where he trains his apprentices. Go there, and see what Xylem is up to.  |cFF660000Specialization: Havoc Demon Hunter|r"
6229,"A Favor for Mr. Shackle : Throm'ka, <class>. My name is Seska. I represent a... trading company. As you can see, I've fallen victim to these giants and their naga allies.  Three of my associates were also captured while surveying this cove. I'm certain that my employer, Mr. Shackle, would be most grateful if you could procure their release."
6230,"The Dark Riders : There's a sewer grate along the edge of the river leading to catacombs underneath Karazhan. I've never paid it much attention, but it could be where the spirits are directing us.  To think, the Dark Riders may have been under our noses this entire time! Come, let us see where this leads."
6231,"Shard of Vorgos : According to the wyrmtongue servant, there is a portal that will take you into the Burning Legion command ship. However, the portal is locked to those without the keys.The first key shard is held by an Ered'ruin known as Vorgos. He resides within the Fel Breach, which is at the end of the Arcway.Slay Vorgos and place the key shard into its position next to the portal."
6232,"In Dire Need : The ill tidings you bear only increase the concerns the Council has been having.  I know you have your hands full with the Tomb of Sargeras. Make no mistake, the battle for the tomb remains our top priority--but we must not think the Legion foolish enough to rely on brute force alone. They are far more cunning than that.  Please, hear us out."
6233,Paradise Lost : Archmage Khadgar was planning an expedition to Azsuna - you should seek him out at Krasus' Landing in Dalaran immediately.
6234,"We Need Weapons : So many of the rebels want to help in the coming battle. Our people have the will, they lack only the means.They need weapons.From what Khadgar has told me, the fortress of Black Rook has plenty of munitions we could use.Travel to the fortress and place these beacons on some weapon caches there. Once placed, I can teleport them back."
6235,"Finding Ebonchill : Ebonchill bears a lineage of powerful wielders dating back to its maker, Alodi. He passed it on to his favorite apprentice and so on until... the archmage Arrexis, I believe.Arrexis disappeared sometime around the First War. I know nothing of his fate, but the answer may well be somewhere in this library.Start by looking around here. Whatever you find should lead us to Ebonchill."
6236,Assault on Val'sharah : The Legion's moves across our lands. Find their forces and remove the threat before it is too late!
6237,"Amateur Hour : The hunters' lodge has attracted a lot of amateurs who call themselves hunters. They're scarin' away all the prize game with their antics.  While I'm a known expert with my rifle, I've yet to manage the art of negotiation.  How about ya do us all a favor and tell those novice hunters to head for the hills?"
6238,"Eredath, Jewel of Argus : The shattered ruin below us is all that remains of Eredath.We called it the Jewel of Argus. It was here that my fellows in the triumvirate guided our people to prosperity. That was a long time ago.<Velen lapses into a moment of silence.>Join me on the surface. We will begin our search for the Crown of the Triumvirate."
6239,"On the Brink : This many withered threaten to wipe our brood out completely!Quickly, <name>! Crack off a ley crystal and heal any wounded drakes you can find out on the battlefield.I will do what I can to keep these whelplings safe and healthy."
6240,"Archdruid of the Claw : Near the southern edge of our forest you will find Sleeper's Barrow.There, Archdruid Koda Steelclaw and her dedicated disciples carry out their sacred duty to observe the Emerald Dream.Find disciple Rylissa Bearsong in Steelclaw Vale and notify her of the crisis in the Grove of Cenarius."
6241,"The Burning Throne : The time has come, <name>, to begin our assault upon Antorus. Everything we have fought for, everything our friends and family have sacrificed, has brought us to this moment.We will fire Light's Judgment upon the walls of the accursed citadel and storm their seat of power. We will end the Legion.After all you have done, it is fitting that you have the honor. Activate the Crown of the Triumvirate and let us finish our mission."
6242,"The Only Way Out is Through : I have much to tell you, but it is not safe to speak here. I cannot hold this barrier forever.  <Thalyssra lifts a delicate flask to her lips. Her eyes shimmer as she takes a sip.>  If we push through, we may find shelter up ahead."
6243,"Call of the Wilds : Beating the Legion requires us to strike quickly and unexpectedly.We have discovered a Dreamway by which we can travel through the Emerald Dream itself. Though only a short walk through the Dream, it will allow us to cross vast distances on Azeroth and even access the ancient home of all druids, Val'sharah.Malfurion is preparing the ritual to open the Dreamway. I need you to summon Zen'tabra and Naralex to his side.Only by combining our efforts can we hope to succeed."
6244,"A Huge Package : Due to the incredible volume of complaints in recent months we have been barred from delivering s... s...<The Postmaster holds back tears, pain visible in his eyes.>Solid stone. We're positively swimming in it - if we can't deliver it then pretty soon we will be overwh-<The Postmaster's eyes light up suddenly.>That's it!There is an old Consortium portal not far from here that we could deposit it in with none the wiser!Can you help, <name>? The stone is extraordinarily heavy."
6245,"Overwhelming Distraction : Do you see the Nightborne outside this room?  They hold us here, like mice in a cage. It is more convenient for them that we are pinned down while they search the Sanctum for my father's relics.  My companions and I can escape to higher ground with some help.  Take this crystal. While standing on a mana focusing rune, use it to overcharge a Conjurer.  Their summons will turn on them and create an opening.  Use it well, and we will meet you atop the stronghold when the way is clear."
6246,"A Kingdom's Heart : My father was a legend. He oversaw the rebuilding of Stormwind, stood toe-to-toe with dragons, led the Alliance to numerous victories.  Then, one day, he was just... gone.  I wear his crown, I hold his title. But I've done nothing to earn them... or the faith of my people.  I've spent the war sequestered in the keep, surrounded by guards and advisors. I need to walk the streets of Stormwind, to know whether it is hope or fear that beats in the hearts of my people.  I welcome your company."
6247,"The Old Fashioned Way : While you experienced the raw majesty that is Nightwell Infusion, Margaux was busy preparing another demonstration for you.  Head across the bridge and to the left, then again across a bridge and to your right. You will find her on the juicing veranda.  Enjoy the remainder of your tour!  <Sylverin offers an intensely fake smile.>"
6248,Dances With Ravenbears : <The chieftain beckons for the ravenbears to gather the tribute and gestures toward the ritual circle outside.>  Caw! Caw ca-caw!  <It looks like he wants you to follow.>
6249,"Turning the Tidemistress : The Tidemistress has fallen back to the elven ruins and is licking her wounds.Her guard is undoubtedly protecting her. To best her, you will have to break her defenses.Construct a ballista using the parts that you salvaged and end her once and for all."
6250,"A Message From Ly'leth : The arcan'dor bears fruit once again. Just in time, too - Ly'leth has sent us a message, and it seems she may have a lead on Vanthir. He is long overdue for this gift, assuming we manage to find him.  Give a fruit to another citizen here in Shal'Aran while I finish decrypting Ly'leth's message."
6251,"Friends With Benefits : The Lunastre Attendant, silent as ever, offers you a wax-sealed scroll.It reads:""Dearest <name>,I asked my attendant to catch you, should things go in my favor.The role of Advisor will keep me away from the estate for some time and I settled on a gift for Thalyssra.I have sent a detachment of attendants to Shal'Aran with some comfort items. Treat them well- they need someone to wait on and I could think of none better!Give the others my thanks, and my love,Advisor Ly'leth Lunastre"""
6252,
6253,Friends in Cages : <Korine stomps her foot and refuses to move.>  They put my friends in cages!  Make the bad men stop hurting them! They take them out the garden and they never come back!  <Korine gestures stubbornly toward the door.>  I am not going home until they do!
6254,"Bottled Up : <You've found a message in a bottle on the corpse. It's a request for aid from someone named Okuna Longtusk. Okuna claims that he and his fellow shipmates are being held prisoner by sea giants.  Maybe if you show the note to the ghost of Lady Irisse at the Crumbled Palace, she can point you in the right direction?>"
6255,"I'll Just Leave This Here : Valtrois has a plan for the Sanctum's energy barrier.Several key Arcway locations throughout Suramar harness the power necessary for it. These Energy Disruptors she made will remotely break the links simultaneously on activation, causing the barrier to fall.Take these devices and install them at the leylines, then return here for the surprise assault on the Sanctum."
6256,"Softening the Target : The Archdruid's end draws near. His memory will live on in the hearts of all who knew him.Elothir's desperate efforts revealed that Malfurion is being held in Shala'nir, amidst the roots of Shaladrassil.My love. So near, yet so far....Shala'nir is infested with Nightmare creatures. To rush in would be suicide.I subdued one of Xavius' creatures. Use it against him, <name> and clear us a path."
6257,"Hungry Work : We must get Chief Telemancer Oculeth back on his feet as soon as possible.Find ancient mana, any way you can, and feed it to him."
6258,"Blade in Twilight : I have been working with Moira Thaurissan to infiltrate the Twilight's Hammer cult. We've learned of an ancient and powerful Old God relic, a blade used at various points in history to wreak havoc.Moira's double agent informs us a new leader is rising, and plans to cement his ascension using this weapon in an unholy ritual. You must find him, stop the ritual, and seize the artifact.We will meet in Dalaran afterwards."
6259,"Ritual Reagents : The Skull of the Man'ari, oh good choice! It's very powerful and it's held by an even more powerful Dreadlord!There is a weakness, the skull has a will of its own! If we can commune with the skull we might be able to convince it to serve you instead!We will need reagents from the floating city before we can perform the ritual to commune with it. Dust from a fresh grave, dark oil, and a powerful alcohol catalyst.Oh, and blood! I sense a beast whose blood should be perfect."
6260,"The Dreadlord's Prize : Kathra'natir escaped my grasp, but I know what his next step will be.He seeks an ancient relic called the Forge of the Guardian, used for centuries by the Council of Tirisfal to infuse their power into the Guardian. The forge was hidden away, its location known only to the Council themselves.Now the dreadlord has this knowledge.We must go to the Violet Hold. I only hope we are not too late."
6261,"Bargaining with Shadows : From the clues you've been able to piece together, it appears that Levia was looking to conduct a ritual in the libraries beneath Dalaran - most likely to summon this ""Agatha"" she has become so infatuated with. I'm afraid this is a little out of my area of expertise, so I'm going to have to call in a favor.  I'll send for assistance from the Council of the Black Harvest. One of their warlocks will meet you in the Chamber of the Guardian to assist with your investigation.  I hope we're not too late."
6262,"Experimental Instability : In order to advance our studies I must ask you to recover a few particular items from my long-forgotten chambers.I assure you it is... mostly safe there, aside from a few unstable elements.Make your way to my workshop and locate the teleporter. I'll disable its cloaking device when you arrive."
6263,"Assault on Stormheim : The eternal foe of our world, the Burning Legion, dare to attack the land of Stormheim!  Champion, now is your call to valor! Find the forces of the Legion and eradicate them!"
6264,
6265,"Tapping the Leylines : The arcways were built to tap into the magical leylines beneath Suramar. As we learned to subsist on the Nightwell, the old facilities fell out of use.This chamber is clearly receiving power from elsewhere.There is only a trickle now, but if you can direct more leyline energy here it will help to sustain us.The closest source is to the north, near Anora Hollow."
6266,"You've Got to Be Kitten Me Right Meow : While you were dealing with the stray Owlkitten, I took a look around.  It seems these curious creatures have a habit of escaping their parents' watchful eyes - some are trapped across the road by a wandering Ettin.   He appears to have been... ahem... eating them.  We can earn Yowlon's blessing by bringing his children home."
6267,"Waterlogged Tome : In spite of its magical nature, the book has been damaged by water.The head of the curators in Dalaran is renowned for his abilities.  Perhaps he can restore it."
6268,"The Archmage Accosted : With the barrier dispelled, Archmage Xylem is finally within reach!  Hopefully he'll be cooperative in returning the Iris..."
6269,"Take Them in Claw : We should have seen this coming. My sister is dead, my friends are wounded and we will likely die here.  I want revenge.  <Lyrea hands you a vial full of growing green liquid.>  We cannot beat them, but we can turn the Stronghold against them.  Wild hippogryphs are attracted to the scent in this bottle. Wild hippogryphs are also notoriously violent when the object of their attraction is not a hippogryph.  Use it to clear a path deeper into the stronghold."
6270,"Dargrul and the Hammer : We are about to follow a drogbar into a cave, something we warn our children never to do.Even so, several of our warbraves have already followed Dargrul inside.Come, join us in battle and let us reclaim the Hammer of Khaz'goroth."
6271,
6272,"Runas Knows the Way : I wish to make it up to you for whatever I did that made you want to kill me.Hmm... your dragon complains about being weak. I know why. Runas can fix it, my friend.One of my kind, Ael'Yith, pulls ley energy from the very ground of Azsuna. I can take you to the location of his mana siphons.It's not too late to undo the harm the others have done. You've done well to trust me."
6273,"To Silence the Bonespeakers : Sigryn's claim to the throne will be challenged by two rivals - Runeseer Faljar of the Bonespeakers and Jarl Velbrand of the Drekirjar.  I would begin in Haustvald with the Runeseer. He was a close ally of Skovald and is a powerful mystic. With the Bonespeakers at his charge, he would prove a staunch opponent if he cannot be made to yield.  Go now, and claim your destiny in the name of the Valkyra!"
6274,"The Spear in the Shadow : Many years ago, a corrupted nightsaber hunted my people. Our chieftain, Dorro Highmountain, took Talonclaw and pursued the beast, but never returned.I have heard tales of a fearsome nightsaber that now stalks the mists of Stormheim. My brother and I believe this to be our ancient foe.The weapon must be there too! If we kill the beast and reclaim the spear, it will be of great use against the Legion."
6275,
6276,The Hidden City : Orathiss has underestimated the seed. It is sapping her power - slowing her down.We must catch her and get the seed to safety!
6277,Argussian Reach : Assist the Argussian Reach by completing 4 world quests.
6278,"A United Front : Our rebel fighters have been armed and morale is high - even the Alliance and Horde elves have ceased their squabbling.  We are nearly ready to march on the city.  Hand out this week's fruit, and then we can begin preparations."
6279,
6280,"To Northrend : Naturally I've done some legwork already. I believe this Gorvold is buried at Shield Hill in the Howling Fjord.Tahu can help locate the grave, and with a short ritual we should have our answers!Meet us at Shield Hill in the Howling Fjord and we'll move on to the next step."
6281,
6282,"Seeking Guidance : Highlord Tirion may be gone, but the Ashbringer is still out there somewhere. Its power would devastate the Legion. We must find it!I wish it were as simple as returning to where Tirion fell. It could be anywhere on that infernal landscape by now.I believe an old friend can help us find the blade. I ask that you place your faith in me and journey to Uther's tomb in the Plaguelands. We will seek answers there."
6283,"Priority Delivery : An adventurer of another time has forgotten to loot something big... something that might cause them great emotional strain if not received quickly.Your destination is Icecrown Citadel, your target the Lich King's corpse. Retrieve the missing item post-haste and deliver it to the stalwart adventurer - he should be somewhere at the Steam Pools in Feralas.My assistant will open a portal to deliver you there. Just a moment!"
6284,"Answering Aggression : I weep for the Nightborne this day.<Silgryn gestures out the door.>Elisande demonstrates the ultimate disdain for her people. So many lives... wasted!All to relay a message: This is what happens to those who defy her.<name>, my friend, we must answer her. We must show her that she cannot slay her people without retribution.Fight back, <name>."
6285,"The Path Forward : <Velen stares beyond the arena for a time.>We must continue on, but I feel Eredath is far from finished with us. We should take advantage of this relative safety while we still can.I will place a signal beacon that will allow the Vindicaar to lock onto our location. Romuul will send us our means of returning to the Vindicaar if there is a need."
6286,"The Call of Icecrown : <A powerful presence again touches your thoughts.>I have ordered your brethren to Icecrown to prepare for the coming conflict, but I have a more important fate in mind for you. You, <name>, will be the hand of our vengeance!Use the Death Gate to return to Acherus and I shall reveal your role in this."
6287,"Call of the Illidari : <name>, Kayn requests that you meet him at Krasus' Landing at once.<Kor'vas leans in close, her voice an urgent whisper.>You must hurry. The Legion has eyes everywhere."
6288,Thalyssra's Drawers : Thalyssra's ransacked estate still contains a number of items important to Thalyssra. Collect them and return them to her.
6289,
6290,"Search and Rescue! : We've got to find Brambley before it's too late!Ol' Brambley an' I have been fightin' side by side since the Third War. When the Burnin' Legion invaded, we didn't think twice about coming to the Broken Isles.Fightin' is what we do best!During the battle ol' Brambley got caught too deep an' got himself captured. Now we've got to rescue him!Last I saw, the demons were keeping him in a prison cell not far from here... let's go!"
6291,"If Words Don't Work... : Unless you have something worth risking my life for, I will not budge.  Vanthir must have told you that my services do not come cheap.  Let's say... enough mana to sustain me for a month.  <Arluin looks smug, as if you could never agree to this request.>"
6292,Treasure Master Iks'reeged : <TEMP> Board the ship then kill fel bats.
6293,"Pop Quiz: Advanced Rune Drawing : Still aching to get into the headmistress' study, eh? I suppose I can let you in... as long as you prove that you've been studying.Proper rune formation is essential when it comes to spellcasting. If you can draw a rune, you can cast a spell.I will provide outlines for you. You can simply use your feet to trace the runes."
6294,"Journey to the Repose : For now, the Illidari can hold the line against the Legion. We will return later to help them drive the Legion from the upper reaches of Faronaar. You and I must concentrate on the Pillars of Creation if the Tomb of Sargeras is to be resealed.  Your saving of Stellagosa is fortuitous. Surely if anyone knows where a Pillar of Creation is, it will be her grandfather, Senegos.  The Azurewing Repose is to the northeast. I will meet you there, <name>."
6295,"Down to Azsuna : <name>, we must find a way to reseal the Tomb of Sargeras.  I have uncovered information concerning an ancient relic, which might be the key to stopping the Legion.  Our search begins on the ancient elven island of Azsuna. Long ago, it was where the Highborne elves of Suramar perfected their mightiest of magics. Now it is a cursed ruin.  The Illidari demon hunters have established a camp on the island. As they are the only people we know in the area, that is where we will begin.  Ready to take wing?"
6296,"The Shattered Watcher : When your adversary - the one called Skovald- completed his first trial, he used his ill-begotten powers to sunder my physical body.  I cannot allow a contender to pass through the vault while I remain unwhole.   His forces have no doubt scattered my pieces through the plateau which they currently desecrate. Bring them back to me, so that I may properly guide your trial."
6297,"Alone in the Abyss : Champion, we will suffer the same fate as the Army of the Light if the Legion fires that infernal weapon upon us.We must descend into the siege camp below and destroy it while we still can!"
6298,"Unanswered Questions : What is done, is done. There are none left to challenge the throne of the Tideskorn.   My brother's words still haunt me, though. If Eyir knows who ordered my family killed, I deserve to know it.  Come, let us return."
6299,"On Public Display : Now that I have identified Vanthir's essence from the multitude of Suramar's citizens, it may be that I can find his exact location.I believe you'll recall a similar ritual with our friend Theryn. Do not worry- there will be less screaming this time. Hopefully.Come. Let us find our missing tavernkeeper."
6300,"Cubic Conundrum : <You find a mysterious cube. Its design is unfamiliar, but unmistakably ancient.   The cube's surface is inlaid with magical runes. Though inert, its properties may be worth investigating.  Perhaps if you show it to Dariness the Learned in Dalaran, she could tell you more about it.>"
6301,"Reverberation : Hati's spirit is bound to yours forevermore, hunter. But it also now carries a link to the Temple of Storms--as well as Silithus, I fear.  The Thunderspark shares these same bonds. By physically linking it here, you can call upon the different aspects of Hati's spirit and bind them to yourself as well.  Do not worry. Skoll and I will guard the Thunderspark with our very lives! It will be safe."
6302,"The Shadow of the Sentinax : This device appears to be used to relay messages to the large demon ship up above. Unfortunately, it is cracked and unresponsive.Perhaps someone at Deliverance Point will know more about these beacons."
6303,A True Test : Vizuul's runebindings are more potent than I had anticipated. Not a bad thing - more power is certainly welcome - but there's certainly more potential for catastrophe if the spell matrix somehow becomes unstable.We should be able to safely contain the fel energy within the containment field using the eon winder you recovered... but keep an eye open just in case.
6304,"The Magister of Mixology : As you must know, I'm a connoisseur of drinks... specifically, arcane-infused spirits. Cocktail mixing is alchemy, and as everyone knows, alchemy is magic.  My latest drink must be more exotic than anything I've conjured before. I already have most of what I need. But there are a couple of items left on the list.  Notice the herons down in the lagoon? As with many of the creatures on Azsuna, the magic coursing through the island permeates them.  Their eggs will do nicely."
6305,"The High Chieftain : I understand what Ebonhorn has been trying to tell me for a while now.Our people do not need a hammer, we need a leader. One willing to stand against any threat, even if they are terrified to do so.And between you and me, I am definitely terrified, but resolved.Let us return to Thunder Totem and prepare ourselves for war."
6306,"Shrine of the Truthguard : We'll be flying straight to the island. My friend said that the warrior who came here before us never entered the shrine itself, since they were after one of the tombs.If a vrykul hero couldn't enter the shrine, I bet it's still protected by Tyr's power. I'm thinkin' we have a good shot at this.My pal Cato will meet us there. We might be needin' the talents of a good healer!"
6307,"Rite of Blood : Oakin Ironbull vouches for you. He's capable, for a Rivermane. You also brought with you proof of your own strength, albeit rather inconclusive proof.  Before we allow you to move freely within our territory, you must complete the Rite of Blood, which you have already begun. If you succeed--and I doubt you will--talk to me.  Enter the depths of the cave. Defeat whatever foe appears and return to me."
6308,"All Along the Waterways : I've noticed some wandering eyes, lately.  I am more than happy to continue delivering the goods to Vanthir, but it is getting increasingly dangerous to do so.   The Duskwatch that walk the bazaar are by far the most observant.  Find and slay the Orbitists so that I may deliver the goods safely.  I will follow behind with the shipment."
6309,"Finding the Scepter : Very powerful, but difficult to acquire. Scepter is in the hands of Gul'dan. We must find out his plans, get close.Calydus know Gul'dan planning major operation. He has sent out a call to arms to all Shadow Council to help with big ritual. One such group at Caer Darrow, talking to the necromancers there.You should go, find out about plan."
6310,"The Prince is Going Down : <name>! I knew you'd come.  Quick, let me out of here and we'll take this giant down."
6311,"In the Bag : Already the city is abuzz with outrage.  I will not lie to you- it pleases me greatly that one such as Coryn is made a fool.  The other houses have sent their endorsements. It is done, and nothing remains but a formal ceremony to grant me the title of advisor.  Meet me there. You deserve to share in this success."
6312,
6313,"The Final Judgment : In my fragmented state, I captured glimpses of a hero meting out justice to the corrupted mystics of Haustvald. I see now, this hero was you, <class>.   I know you seek my judgment, but my spirit is still fragmented. As we speak,  Runeseer Faljar is calling upon dark, forbidden magics in an attempt to banish my spirit to Helheim. If he succeeds, your trial will be lost.  My connection here is fading. Go, there is little time!"
6314,"Stolen Thunder : Titanstrike is in the tomb of Warlord Volund somewhere on the isle of Shield's Rest. It's a dank, sloppy mess adrift in a sea of gloom.Sounds lovely, eh?I've been workin' with a vrykul guide named Prustaga. She'll help us break the wards keepin' the tomb sealed.I know what you're thinkin'... vrykul are trouble. But she hasn't taken a swing at me just yet.Huey'll take us down to the shore. Prustaga's probably found the tomb by now!"
6315,
6316,"Cloaked in Moonshade : I do not know what Theryn found, but I know where he found it.   Moonshade Sanctum, to the west. Beyond the Temple of Fal'adora.   Whatever power altered Theryn's arcane essence... Whatever power allowed Kel'danath to create a spell to soothe the withered... Its source rests there.   I know this as surely as if I had been there myself."
6317,"Feasting on the Dragon : You killed their leader, so they came here? Understandable. These creatures crave only one thing - magic - and they can sniff it out from leagues away.Without a leader, they will soon wither and die. Our only recourse in the meantime is to put as many as possible down before they take these dragons with them!"
6318,"The Vindicaar Matrix Core : Much has happened on Argus that concerns me but none moreso than Xe'ra's fate. I wonder sometimes if we are doing the right thing? But we must carry on. I can rig the Matrix Core that powers the Vindicaar to allow you to call on the power of our guns when you have need of them on the planet. Go to the Matrix Core in the room at the heart of our ship. Once linked, whatever powers the core has installed now and in the future will be at your disposal."

6320,"Precious Little Left : I have not been able to leave the safety of my guardians to search, but there are three tomes of great importance to me and mine.   They contain secrets and cantrips that the Nightborne must NOT obtain.   <Lothrius raises his hand to your forehead, cementing the names of three tomes into your mind>   If we cannot best them, we must preserve all we can. Hurry, <name>."
6321,Mglrgrs Of Our Grmlgrlr : Mlrg...mglrmlr...Gmlrgmlr mglrml gmlrg! Mlrgrlgr!<Mrgrglilgrl points at the trail of spiderwebs leading out of the ruin.>
6322,"Shadowguard Dispersion : Lend me the aid of your order once again, that we might end the Shadowguard threat permanently. While you confront the Legion, we will face the void. The attack commences once your forces arrive."
6323,"How It's Made: Arcwine : <Margaux speaks in a hushed tone.>  While we walk through the Vineyard, we may find time to exchange information.  Try not to look alarmed at what you see, hm?  <Margaux flashes a vacant, forced smile.>  Shall we press on?"
6324,"Saving Stellagosa : During the fighting, of all things, I saw a blue drake swoop in and attack the demons. I couldn't believe my eyes. I'd heard that the Blue Dragonflight had gone extinct.  The Legion managed to bring the drake down, but not until after she'd killed a score of them. She was magnificent. Last I saw, they were dragging her in the direction of the southern camp.  We should see if she's still alive. A dragon could prove a powerful ally."
6325,"The Forgotten Heir : My brother... lives?  The last time I saw him, the assassins were closing in on him. I can't imagine how he defeated them...  We should travel to Vrekt. I would look upon my brother with my own eyes."
6326,"The Voice of Thunder : The White Tiger has prepared a series of challenges for everyone who wants to possess the weapons of the storm.Now you know of their power - these are the very artifacts that Ra-den himself wielded during the age of the Titans.Come! I have led arena teams to victory across three continents. With me in your corner, you cannot lose!"
6327,"Fangs of the Devourer : If you spare me I can use the rune of portals you provided to open a gateway to Akaari's citadel in the Twisting Nether.Of course, killing the Legion's master assassin in her own domain will be no simple feat, but surely the Fangs of the Devourer are worth the risk, no?<Val'zuun smiles.>I will guide you through the citadel once you arrive, but you will have to defeat Akaari on your own."
6328,"Dispensing Compassion : There is much you need to learn about our city.  First and foremost, Arcwine. It is the vehicle by which we imbibe the Nightwell's energies. Without it, we wither and die.  Palace lackeys have seen fit to ration it, thinking this will control us. Keep us quiet, complacent.  I would like you to look for those in need near the tavern. You will find many, but those most desperately afflicted by this rationing will be obvious.  Take this flask. Revive them. Tend to their suffering."
6329,"Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester : The book says the Dark Riders were last seen in a place called Manor Mistmantle. If friend can find these riders, then <he/she> can get Ulthalesh!  Calydus will wait here and await your return. Find Ulthalesh, friend!"
6330,"Entangled Dreams : I sense powerful magic emanating from deep within the barrow.Whatever is down there weaves a powerful spell, entangling us within our dreams.I am still too weak, but your skills are quite impressive, hero. I can see why Malfurion puts his trust in you.Go and eliminate the source of this magic."
6331,"A Mage's Weapon : It is decided, then.  The foundation of the Tirisgarde's strength lies in the ancient artifacts wielded by its champions. Your first task will be to retrieve one such artifact.  The master appendix of this library lists every artifact known to the Council of Tirisfal. There should be a few choices in there worth looking into.  I will leave it to you to choose which to pursue."
6332,"The Champion's Return : I can sense the power of the artifact you hold. It will do well against the Legion as it is, but we have the ability to unlock its power even further.   You must return to the Hall of the Guardian. You can use the incantation I taught you before to pass through the runes."
6333,"Make an Entrance : I need you to infiltrate the Twilight Vineyards and bring back something to deal with these insects.  To do that, you will need a way to bypass the guards that keep the orchards secure.  Ly'leth will be able to help us there. I will arrange to have her meet you near the entrance.  Go quickly!"
6334,A Ticket for Marin : This Vault Ticket should be delivered to Marin Noggenfogger.
6335,"The Captain's Foot Locker : I don't care what you do, mate. But, if you get caught, you didn't see me.  I wasn't here."
6336,"Fisherman's Tonic : If you detest these serpents as much as we do, I ask that you continue the fight against them.That will mean fighting them in their watery domain. I don't see any gills on you, so we're going to have to concoct an old tonic used by vrykul fishermen.The ingredients are plentiful around here, taken that you do not mind picking through entrails."
6337,"A Familiar Fate : We had come to defend the Halls of Valor... I was taken from the sky...  I cannot break free of my bindings. Find the jailer who made this cell...  Set me free, friend..."
6338,
6339,"Those Who Remember : The ghostly elves, to the south, once had the Pillar of Creation known as the Tidestone of Golganneth.Their great city of Nar'thalas was destroyed an eon ago. The city's ruler, Prince Farondis, fell with the city. You small ones die so easily.If anyone knows where the fragments rest, it will be the ghost of the prince. Seek out his people."
6340,"The Hunter's Call : I realize we have never met, but you will learn of my order soon enough. For now, pleasantries must wait.The Legion has returned to Azeroth stronger than ever, and we need new weapons to fight them.I have met three individuals here in Dalaran who have leads on ancient artifacts which could prove vital in the battle to come. Acquiring these weapons demands the skills of a master hunter.Speak to each of them and decide whom you will aid first."
6341,"Waxing Crescent : His captor is familiar to me. He is one of Aluriel's lieutenants and a skilled spell-fencer at that. You will need Silgryn's help to retrieve the key to Vanthir's prison.Our friend's life hangs in the balance. Even if we manage to wrestle him from the executioner's grasp, he may well Wither before we can act.I need you to take an Arcan'dor fruit to him. They are precious, and few, but for Vanthir this is the only chance he has.Go quickly, and good luck."
6342,"Eating Into Our Business : Greetings traveler! You are welcome to rest at our camp, but if you plan on sticking around a while, I have a proposition for you.  As you can see, the land here has been very good to us, providing a great natural bounty. Lately, however, the worg have become problematic, and are thinning the herds to unacceptable levels.  I can't take care of them all, so I will offer a bounty for every worg slain in the mesa. Return to me when you have culled their pack a bit."
6343,"The Withered : The withered are the worst kind of pest. They capture our whelplings, knock them unconscious, and then drink whatever mana they can from the helpless babes.Normally our drakes and keepers would fend them off. Today, it looks like we may need your help."
6344,Spray and Prey : The Bug Sprayer you recovered from Ormgul the Pestilent seems like it could give us an advantage against the drogbar and their insects.  Spray the Drogbar with their own alchemy and watch their insects turn against them.
6345,"The Warchief Beckons : Greetings, $p. I am here on behalf of Lady Sylvanas Windrunner. I should hope you recognize the name.<Nathanos thrusts a sealed envelope into your hand.>Read it and follow me.You can read, can't you?"
6346,"A Mlrglrmg For Grlmrgl : Mrglm, rmgrlg mrlgmrl.Grmrglmrl mlrmglrgr mlrmlgr! Rglrmgl rmglrgmlr mlmlglr mglgrgrlm - grlgmr, mlgr - lrgmlrgr rmgrmlg mlrg! Mlrgr?Mrlgmrlgmrl rmglrmglr!<Pearlhunter Phin makes a stabbing motion.>"
6347,"The Wranglers : Great evil exists on Argus and our forests house some of the worst of it. My wranglers are at the edge of the forest and are waiting for reinforcements. That would be you.  Seek out Lead Rider Jerek, he will tell you more."
6348,"Paid in Blood : If Mimiron's fancy gadgets be right, then the other half o' Hati is near the wound in Silithus.  We'll have tae move quickly. Even with part o' his essence contained, I can feel him fadin' away fast!  'Tis a long trip, <lad/lass>. Let's get movin'!"
6349,"A Trial of Might : I owe you my gratitude for helping make me whole again, outsider. It is clear that you are worthy to take on the trials.   Go now into the vault. There you will find the archive for the first trial you must undertake.  I will meet you inside."
6350,"Runas the Shamed : I fell so quickly, <name>. I am not as strong as I once was. We truly do need your help.One of these disgusting creatures ran off with several of the whelplings. I heard him called by name:Runas.I will survive. Home is not far. You still have strength, though. Slay this Runas before he does any more damage to our brood."
6351,"Unexpected Allies : You have gained my trust. Not all drogbar are as violent as the savages led by Dargrul the Underking, nor are all tauren as bloodthirsty as the Bloodtotem.  You may tell Mayla Highmountain that she has our support. The cavern we call home is yours to explore freely as well, <name>."
6352,"Eating Before the Meeting : Having Vanthir around has done much to lift the spirits of the people here. I dare say some have begun to relish their newfound freedom, even if they miss their beloved city.  I will not rest until I can give it back to them.  You and I have an important meeting to attend. Before we go, let us distribute more of the arcan'dor's fruit.   I want people to know that although I must leave for now, I have not abandoned them."
6353,
6354,"Make Your Mark : While you were out, I asked around.  You are looking for Overseer Durant. Turns out he lives near the Shimmershade Garden.  I can help you confront him, but you will need help. There are three individuals with the necessary skills, and they serve our cause.  Tell Cyrille that the owl hoots at dusk.  Inform Lorin that the saber prowls the plaza.  Mention to Sylessa that the cruel caskmaster has breathed his last.  They will know what to do.   Speak to Vanthir when the deed is done."
6355,"A Stranger's Plea : My people... enslaved...  Beaten... within death's grasp...  <The cowled figure weakly raises his arm, handing you a small liquid skin.>  Help... us..."
6356,"Cubic Currents : To determine this cube's purpose, we need to power it up. Hmm, I have an idea...The Nightborne covet a substance you are no doubt familiar with called ancient mana. Should be just the thing for a relic this old. Gather a sufficient quantity and we'll attempt to get it working.Be careful in Suramar! It would be a shame if this curious cube were lost and became a memory once more."
6357,"Join the Dreamer : I'm afraid I can't really help you actually enter the Emerald Dream - we dryads merely shift our bodies between the planes.That's ok, though - Naralex has offered to help!Go to the very bottom of the Tel'Andu Barrow Den. Naralex is already there setting things up for you."
6358,"The Dreamer Returns : Arch Druid Greathoof will be expecting word on the success of our mission, but I'm afraid I must ask you to return alone.I can't rest knowing that Xavius has Lord Ursoc in his clutches. Just the thought of it makes me shake with rage! I'll find where he has been taken if I have to search every corner of Azeroth!Our paths will cross again, <name>. Be sure of it."
6359,Neltharion's Lair: Death to the Underking : I will direct my people to clear a path through this rubble and assault Dargrul's forces directly.It will be a ruse.Navarrogg proposed a plan that I believe has merit. He knows of a side entrance that might lead directly to Dargrul.Muster what allies of yours you can and strike at them through this side passage. Recover the Hammer of Khaz'goroth before that villain brings the mountain down on top of us.We will provide the distraction you need to get a shot.
6360,"Redemption for the Fallen : Soon the change of seasons will be upon us, and the Nightfallen will take command of their fate.You have given them hope, and set them on the path to redemption. They need you now more than ever.We all do."
6361,"Thwarting the Twins : I have news from Archmage Karlain! The Kirin Tor have found Raest Magespear and can open up a portal to his location!  If you are ready to face him, I can have the mages here open the portal into the Twisting Nether."
6362,
6363,"Storming the Citadel : We have already secured ground near Nath'raxas Hold. It is one of the Legion's chief military fortifications on Argus.  Striking it now, and hard, may be our only opportunity to tip the scales in our favor."
6364,"The Nightborne Prince : <Senegos is focused.>I sense it now. In the ruined building, to the east. One of these cretins must have tapped deep into the ley line.I suspect he will be heavily defended, <name>. Once again, the well-being of my brood is in your hands."
6365,"The Hunter of Heroes : Helya has made a mockery of my order by creating her own ""helarjar"", powerful undead tasked with hunting down heroic warriors and taking their souls before my val'kyr can claim them. Among them is her personal champion, Vigfus Bladewind, who wields stolen blades I forged myself long ago.  He has returned to Tideskorn Harbor with a full cargo of stolen souls to take to Helheim. Go there, kill him and his helarjar, and make the swords yours."
6366,"Walking in Shadows : If we are to infuse the shard's power into the Ashbringer we will need help. We cannot wield such dark magic; however, I know who can...The Knights of the Ebon Blade.I will commission a flight for you to Acherus at once and meet you there - find Aludane Whitecloud in Dalaran when you are ready."
6367,"Away From Prying Eyes : Wars are not won solely with armies charging bravely across the battlefield, <class>t.Sometimes, it is the actions of individuals that matter most, fighting battles few ever hear about. That is why - <Khadgar furrows his brow slightly.>We should really discuss this somewhere a tad more private. Let's move up to the Purple Parlor, shall we?"
6368,
6369,"The Felsoul Experiments : Andaris's control over the withered poses a real threat. If we are to increase the withered's resistance against these effects, we must do so in an environment built from this very magic.  Head for Felsoul Hold at once. When you arrive, I will send withered to aide in your efforts. It is of the utmost importance you do not leave until you are certain the experiments yield the appropriate results."
6370,"Hindering the Legion War Machine : <class>t, I could use your help. The Army of the Light is coordinating an attack against the Spirit Crucible, Terminus, and Shaper's Rise to cripple the Legion's ability to wage war outside of the Antoran Wastes. We do not have enough soldiers to defend our footholds and execute this operation.  Will you approach the <class>s on our behalf? This gambit could succeed with them fighting by our side. We can paralyze the Legion war machine."
6371,"The Tidestone: Shattered : I suppose you can go in, then.The shattered pieces of the Tidestone of Golganneth are contained within the academy's eastern wing. Even as curator, I cannot attest to their condition, as I have not been in to inspect them in many millennia.Oh, young <name>? Please do not touch anything."
6372,Shipwrecked Sailors : <The gilblin and makrura of Mak'rana have captured the forsaken sailors from the nearby shipwreck.>  <It looks like the sailors are being poisoned and worse. Best to put them out of their misery.>
6373,"Paw Patrol : While Speedy IV was collecting supplies, Stringfellowe was scouting the rest of the Eye of Azshara.  Turns out there is a whole mess of pirates to the west.  That must be where the pets are at.  Head over there and rescue the pets."
6374,"Blood of My Blood : As my darling <brother/sister> has demonstrated, Elisande's decision to bring down the shield has sown unrest among the nightborne.Loyalists and demons march together in the streets. Fear and distrust grip our hearts. Family turns against family.I will help Thalyssra stir a new rebellion, but first we must deal with Anarys.I do not wish to spill the blood of my blood - only to help <him/her> see reason.Anarys is likely brooding over our father's memorial. Bring <him/her> to me alive."
6375,"The Demons Below : Something, someone, intended us to never awaken. I sense their presence is still here in the barrow.<Koda takes a moment to stand.>My body is weak from deep slumber.If you would aid us, clear our barrow of any enemies."
6376,"Prepare To Strike : The Burning Legion took us by surprise at the Peak of Serenity. We will not allow them to do so again!We have trained hard, but we need weapons capable of destroying this great evil if we are to have any chance of success.Our scrolls speak of several weapons that should prove suitable, but we are unable to decide which one to pursue first.The choice, Grand Master, is yours."
6377,"A New Threat : If you seek the Nexus, I would warn not to rush headlong. There are strange happenings in Coldarra, and it would be best to gather some information before proceeding.  During my last visit to the Dragonblight, I sensed unusual energies from the Azure Dragonshrine. Since this place was very closely tied to Malygos' plans during the Nexus Wars, whatever is present there may explain the current state of the Nexus.  I cannot accompany you, but this crystal can be used to communicate with me. Good luck."
6378,The Search for the Highlord : Tirion is fading away on that infernal shore... and the Ashbringer with him! We must not waste another moment.Give the word and we'll set off. We're ready when you are.
6379,"Essential Consumption : As before, <name>, once you are ready raise your artifact and channel its energy upon the Heart of Zin-Azshari and we will unleash the power of the essence you gathered.Do not worry - we still have enough of the blood you gathered to ensure the ritual remains stable."
6380,"Audience with the Windlord : I have kept my promise. Thunderaan the Windlord awaits.  Know that if betrayal is in your heart, the Windlord will not be deceived. Be silent, and perhaps your audience shall be a fortunate one."
6381,
6382,"The Scythe of Elune : I have received word that Tyrande herself has authorized the release of a great artifact, the Scythe of Elune, to aid our cause. Valorn Stillbough has agreed to give up the weapon, which he has kept as part of an investigation into the cursed worgen of Duskwood.  I believe that you, champion, will be our best hope at wielding its power without succumbing to the animal rage that ebbs within. You must go to Duskwood, and take up the scythe against our foes!"
6383,"The Dreadblades : I can promise ya a safe journey to Eliza's position, but once we're there... well, we both know there be no guarantees.The plan is simple. We'll take the Crimson Veil as close as we can get her without being seen and disembark from there.Once we're ashore, we'll board the Horizon's Edge, bribe her mutinous crew to hand it over, and hunt down Eliza and her legendary blades wherever she may be.Just say the word when yer ready."
6384,"Return to Sender : You've arrived just in time!Unlike the mail as of late, I'm afraid.We are severely understaffed, and demand is at an all-time high. We simply can't keep up!I'd love to chat, but I need help catching up before I can rest for even a moment.First thing's first. Several parcels of rejected mail have broken loose again; will you help me round them all up and return them to their senders?"
6385,
6386,"Threat Reduction : In time, Hatuun and his people will set aside their bitterness and become valuable allies. But their trust must be earned.He says their village is beset by a demon called Aggonar and his cruel kin.We need these fiends out of the way before we can seek out Alleria and the others.The chieftain lent us his horn. Use it to call down his people's vengeance upon the demon lieutenants while I carve a path to Aggonar's lair."
6387,"Full Might of the Elves : Thalyssra managed to get all 3 to agree to the same thing? I am impressed with her skills of negotiation.Alright hero, Liadrin is already marching on Suramar. Join her forces.Tyrande will flank the city defenders and meet you deeper in.The Nightborne will bring up the rear and hold the territory for us.Oculeth and I will move the Kirin Tor forces to Astravar Harbor. With luck, we shall see you on the other side."
6388,"Stem the Tide : Skovald has profaned the Gates of Valor with his demonic allies. Among his forces his twisted mystics have conjured portals to ferry his fel allies from their blighted worlds.   If we wish to stem this tide, these portals must be destroyed.   I will gather my allies. Take this horn and signal when you have found a portal, and we will strike from the skies!"
6389,Holding the Ramparts : With their ground presence weakened the Legion has retaliated with additional forces.  Our allies managed to track several of these demons to the skies above Black Rook. I fear they intend to establish a foothold.  Take this hippogryph and scout the ramparts. Should this fear become a reality I ask that you deal with the threat swiftly.
6390,Call of The Uncrowned : My masters gave me strict instructions to deliver this letter to you as quickly as possible.Its contents are for you and you alone.Good luck.
6391,"Leyline Abuse : These monsters are pulling mana directly out of the ground. This explains why not even my mana pools can dull my pain.I worry about my brood. Without the power of the ley lines, we are nothing. At this rate, I may not even be able to help you with your Tidestone.Look for their mana siphons, and punish the cowardly nightfallen elves that are using them."
6392,"Vengeance Will Be Ours : We aren't going to get our forces anywhere near the Broken Shore without getting knocked out of the sky.I think it best if you handle this matter yourself - there are none among us more capable on the field of battle.Save Allari and her men if you can, but the Aldrachi Warblades will do far more for this war than warm bodies."
6393,The Tranquil Forest : Archmage Khadgar sent word about Val'sharah not long ago. It sounds like he has good news.You should meet him on Krasus' Landing in Dalaran as soon as you are able.
6394,"More Like Me : Greetings, Outlander.I am Victoire. I served Elisande while she maintained peace in the city. I fought beside demons and worse for the greater good.The massacre at the Waning Crescent made it clear that she no longer serves the Nightborne. She serves only herself.There are others who feel as I do. They simply need proof that there is another way.The Dusk Lily is not unknown to us- try showing it to those now guarding Astravar Harbor. They have seen the worst of Elisande's cruelty."
6395,
6396,"Little One Lost : I'm ready to go home now, but there are still scary men outside...  Will you stay with me? Make sure they don't take me away?  I don't want to go back in the cage..."
6397,"Flow Control : If all goes as planned, the manastorm will cause the leyline to flare up, sending a great surge of energy through the arcway.  In order for the surge to reach Shal'Aran, we must seal off any outlets along the way. If we miss even one, the mission fails - and hundreds of people will be vaporized by the energy blow off.  Thalyssra had better be sure about this tree."
6398,
6399,"Balance to Spare : Our tour is just about over. I will let you loose to 'walk the orchard', as is proper at this stage.  While you are there, you will notice a large number of mana wyrms floating about.  I am certain the vineyard would not miss a handful of them.  Good luck with your insect problem, friend.  <Margaux smiles warmly at you.>"
6400,
6401,"Homeward Bounding : The first step to establishing a moonwell is to gain the blessings of the local wildlife.   It is their good will that enables us to  peacefully coexist, and a moonwell thrives on such energies. Combined with Elune's light, a moonwell can purify its surroundings for years.  To begin, we must find creatures willing to give their blessing. We can start with these owl-cat creatures.  They ran while you cleaned, but I saw one lingering just before the bridge.   See if you can find where it lives!"
6402,"Continuing the Cure : Given the events at the Waning Crescent, the refugees here are more eager than ever to receive the gift of the arcan'dor and be free of the Nightwell forever.   Fortunately, the tree has borne more fruit. Again, I ask that you honor us by giving this fruit to anyone here in Shal'Aran.  When you are finished, we shall discuss further developments within the city. Silgryn reports that Arluelle has proven a fine student, and the two are making progress in evacuating citizens."
6403,"Righteous Fury : The devastators bombarding our forces prevent us from advancing any further. I can only protect us from their blasts for so long.Champion, you must pierce their lines and remove the barriers protecting the devastators.If you can destroy the anchors that maintain the shields, I can cleanse them from afar."
6404,"The Call To War : <A chilling thought brushes your mind.>Hear me, <name>.The Legion has returned. They hope to control us, to bend us to their will. Fools - they only walk back within reach of our blades.Your brethren within Dalaran have begun to gather at Krasus' Landing. Go, meet with Duke Lankral and all will be explained."
6405,"A Way Back In : I must get back into Suramar.I was exiled unfairly! I cannot live out here like this. I need the Nightwell's energies...I saw a message carved into a wall a few days ago. There is someone in the Water Gardens who can smuggle people into the city.It said ""We shall drink of the Well again.""I cannot survive a confrontation with the guards again. Will you go in my stead? Once I am back in the city I can repay you."
6406,
6407,"Battle for Highmountain : Our defenses have grown in strength, yet the Legion continues to press their assault on Thunder Totem. There is but one way to put an end to this madness - we must strike at the heart of their forces together and bring these attacks to an end."
6408,The Conveniences of Home : This chest could prove very useful to our efforts. Take the chest back to Shal'aran.
6409,"End of the Risen Threat : Commander Shadowsong sends word that he is prepared to face the late Lord Erdris. I have a letter from him for you.I'm prepared to teleport you to his location, but there's a snag.In order to combat the worst of the fel corruption, you will need to use some Nethershards on the way in. Make sure you have some before speaking with me."
6410,"Where Dragons Rule : Thanks to your help, Thrymjaris was able to escape the clutches of that vile demon. She bid me wait for you, so that I could take you to her once you had finished dispatching your foes.  She has gathered our brood at the top of Thorim's Peak to prepare for a counterattack.   Would you join us?"
6411,"Awakening the Archdruid : Now, we must focus our efforts on waking Archdruid Steelclaw.She and our druid brethren slumber in the barrow dens to the south.With the furbolgs quelled, we can pass safely to the entrance.Go and awaken the Archdruid. I pray to Elune that we are not too late."
6412,
6413,"Dark Whispers : Felsoul Hold is not far away, but it is well defended. Very tough to get in the normal way, but Calydus can help you sneak in!There is a portal that my kind use to haul in treasures, with it you can get in and find the skull!"
6414,"A Gift for Greymane : It looks like the Gilnean infiltrators brought some heavy ordnance to the fight. It's likely they intend to use them on the walls of Dreadwake's Landing.  If these could be rigged to Greymane's ship, it could make for a decisive end to his assault on the outpost."
6415,"Still Alive : Wait, what was it that I heard? Was it... ""feast on the dragons""? We must check on grandfather, right away!Let me know when you're ready to depart."
6416,"Defenseless and Afraid : This is the battle that raged while I awaited the Genedar. So many ran to join me, but Kil'jaeden inspired still more to stand in their way.My people were slaughtered without mercy.To cover our retreat I ordered for this arena's defenses to be activated. It is clear that they were unable.To turn the tide in this battle, to give these spirits rest, we must do what they could not. Find a way to activate the pylons."
6417,"A Vessel Made Ready : After some consideration, I have decided to allow Alleria another opportunity to pursue her destiny.I suppose you want to know what that means, mortal.<Locus-Walker laughs.>Meet us deep in the Shadowguard camp ahead- my brethren are preparing a summons that will provide adequate energy for Windrunner to begin again.Witness what happens when you harness the Void's power."
6418,
6419,"The Ruins of Oronaar : Many krokul wander the city below, shrouded in shadow. I will not accept that they are all beyond redemption.  Arkhaan was a leader, once. Some among his followers may still reside in the ruins of Oronaar, straddling the thin divide between reason and oblivion. Enlist the aid of your order. Scour the ruins for any that can be saved."
6420,"Tools of the Trade : I used to visit here before the barrier was raised. While the ruling council and the Grand Magistrix argued and politicked I watched the caretakers  perform their rituals and venerate the dead.I would honor the spirits here one last time. I am headed to the tombs. If some of the sacred oils, burial shrouds, or incense survived the ages then bring them to me."
6421,"The Tainted Marsh : I wasn't able to scout inside the village yet, however, there are more dangerous experiments going on to the south. They were befouling the unquiet spirits in the marshlands with more fel magic!I will rework this fel totem to draw out the fel energies they infused in those spirits.Please, cure what spirits you can, perhaps it will even give them some peace.If you want, I can even send you there!"
6422,"An Offering of Light : I sense it. The nobility in Xe'ra's heart. Her relentless defiance of the Legion. Let this be her legacy.  In building the Vindicaar, we fashioned the Netherlight Crucible to harness the tremendous powers at play on Argus. I believe Xe'ra's essence is one key to that potential.  Yet the Light alone is not enough. Without balance, there can be no harmony, no cohesion.  Infuse this essence into the crucible, champion. It is the first step in unlocking the strength needed to end the Burning Crusade."
6423,"Signal Boost : The Skyfire's starboard propeller came to rest on the cliffs overlooking our camp - we're gonna use it like a big antenna and push our distress signal so far that even Mekkatorque's alarm clock could pick it up!Unfortunately, it might attract some unwanted attention.We're braced for enemy contact down here at the camp - fire up that signal and be ready to defend the antenna!"
6424,"Following the Scent : You will have to continue through the portal without me, <class>. I have assisted you in locating your mage's whereabouts, so I consider my debt to Modera paid.  However, I will lend you one of my felhounds to help track this mage down. If she is as powerful as Modera says, then it would be in everyone's best interest that Agatha not be allowed to keep her.  Best of luck, <class>, and try to bring Fhambar back in one piece."
6425,"Looking into the Darkness : Friend now is ready to perform the ritual!  Remember, friend, the skull must be convinced that it is in its best interest to be in your possession. If we must force the skull into your servitude, it would be far weaker."
6426,"A Trial of Valor : To seek the Aegis of Aggramar, a champion must complete three great trials before riding into glorious battle through the Gates of Valor. Here you will find the knowledge of the trials you must seek out, as well as the first challenge you must face.  Above us, adorning the central plateau, you will find the archive for the Trial of Valor. Seek it out, and learn where your path leads."
6427,"The Emerald Queen : <name>, you have returned. Good.I have counseled with the other archdruids and concluded that Cenarius' condition is merely a symptom of a much greater problem. Your experiences in Moonclaw Vale make that clear.We need help.There is one who can bring understanding to these events. With Thaon gone, we must ask that you aid us in reaching out to the Lady of Dreams."
6428,"Demon Souls : I need to extract information about the Burning Legion from these foul creatures. But living, the demons are almost impossible to break.  However, like you, I wield a powerful artifact -- the Scythe of Souls.  Take one of my soul gems. If you place it next to a demon's corpse, it will rip the 'soul' out. Then, we will see if the scythe can get them to talk."
6429,"A Gift of Time : You have done a great thing for the blue dragons today, <name>, as well as for my own peace of mind.  Now, armed with Light's Wrath, I only ask that you fulfill your original goal, and take the fight to the Legion.  I believe Alonsus Faol awaits your return. Safe travels, friend."
6430,"The Prophet's Gambit : I can feel their presence just ahead. It is as faint as the lightest breeze that once rolled across these hills, but it is not of the Legion, of that I am certain.We must see if these broken are potential allies. It is a great risk, but our numbers are too few to ignore the chance."
6431,"A Worthy Blade : For quite some time, we've been looking for someone who can operate outside these halls.<name>, you are the answer to that search. You will be the blade in the dark that vanquishes our foes.In order to do so, you require weapons capable of striking down the Legion's best.Greymane, Tethys, and Valeera each have devised plans to obtain weapons worthy of the tasks to come. I suggest you hear each out before proceeding."
6432,"The Underking Comes : Here, I'm too slow to get these laggards to safety. Take my horn and sound the evacuation.We need to get the people out of here before the drogbar arrive. The warbraves can take it from there.For now just send them over to Spiritwalker Ebonhorn. That fool can watch over them until it is safe."
6433,"Aid on the Front Lines : When we settled here, that Hold was just a quiet creepy place that we avoided. Then the elves came back from the dead. With your help we thought it was mostly handled. But now it feels like an army is attacking us!  We could use more healing at our defense lines. More undead arrive and we have less and less protectors each wave. Any aid to our wounded would be welcomed!"
6434,"The Path of Huln : Armies are vital to the success of a war. But so are symbols.For our people, few things make for a better symbol than the blessings of our most eldest ancestors.Mayla must walk the Path of Huln.The path is dangerous, and she may only bring two people with her: a spiritwalker to guide her and a champion to protect her.Will you be the champion?"
6435,"Shield, Meet Spell : There you have it, one arcane nullifier! Using their weapon and magical signatures to cloak the spell, it should tear apart the shield as good as any spellbreaker would.Go teach that amateur spellslinger what it means to wage war against the sin'dorei!"
6436,
6437,"Aluneth, Greatstaff of the Magna : Aluneth... a powerful and dangerous weapon. If tales are to be believed, Aluneth is actually the name of a very old and very powerful arcane entity, somehow bound to a staff through ancient magic.  When Aegwynn relinquished Aluneth many years ago, it was entrusted to Kirin Tor, who, fearing its unbridled power, handed it to the blue dragonflight to secure away in secret. Only they would know exactly where it was taken.  The dragon Kalec may be our best chance. He now resides on the Council of Six."
6438,Murlocs: The Next Generation : The time has come! Murky and his followers need a place to hide out and train--away from the mature murlocs--so that they can prepare to take over in the future.  There's a nice cave not too far away... only problem is that it's filled with makrura.  This would be a good base for the tadpoles. Murky must go show them what for!  Mindmeld with Murky in his egg and show him how it's done!
6439,"Written in Stone : <You bundle the notes and store them away in your pack.  According to his final journal entry, Kel'danath used something called a ""spellstone"" in his experiments.  The spellstone, if not the arcanist himself, must be nearby.>"
6440,"Summons to the Keep : Greetings, <name>.  Your presence has been requested in the royal court. The crown has urgent need of you!  Please return to Stormwind at your earliest convenience.  King Greymane is anticipating your swift arrival."
6441,"The Unseen Path : For a thousand years, the Unseen Path has watched and waited. We remained few in number, quietly acting behind the scenes when Azeroth needed us. Only a select few even knew our group existed.But the time for lingering in the shadows is over.Before we begin our work, you should hear more about the Unseen Path."
6442,
6443,By Any Means : We need to find out Varedis' location from the eredar inside this prison - the kind warden and his men here are all that stand in our way.We'll take them on together if need be - whatever it takes.
6444,"Crystal Clearing : This portal is a problem. With it they can summon countless reserves.The crystals nearby seem to be powering the gate. If we destroy those, we can set them back significantly."
6445,"The Temple of Elune : Cenarius is in danger.If his condition is not reversed soon, he will be lost to the Nightmare that threatens the Emerald Dream. To spare him that fate, we must have the Tears of Elune - the same relic you were sent here to retrieve.Elune's temple is not far. Go there. Find Lyanis. Show her my seal and instruct her to release the tears into your custody.Hurry, <name>. Time is short."
6446,
6447,"Quality of Life : I am afraid, <name>. We're so close to home, so close to salvation...Astoril says he knows the rest of the way through and can get us there safely. I believe him, but you've come this far to see us safe. Will you see this through to the end?"
6448,"I Have a Bad Feeling About This : You have no reason to trust me. My cousins led by Dargrul have gone mad with power.  But I ask you to investigate something. I have a feeling something terrible is about to befall Highmountain, and that Torok and his Bloodtotem are going to be responsible.  If you don't believe me, look for yourself at the northern side of Cliff's Edge."
6449,"The Coming Storm : You saved us all, my friend! Truly you embody all the elements stand for.If the Earthen Ring is to prevail, we will need weapons of great power. I know where to find some. After the Pandaren Campaign, the weapons of the storm god Ra-den were discovered beneath the Throne of Thunder. None have been able to wield them, so great is their power.They were placed in the care of the White Tiger, who will give them only to one who is worthy. Come <name>! Travel with me to Pandaria and we will prove your worth!"
6450,
6451,
6452,"A Legend You Can Hold : To face the trials ahead, you require a weapon that can enhance your considerable abilities. I have learned of a few possibilities that you might consider.You must decide which weapon to pursue first. I have the utmost confidence in your decision."
6453,Invasion Onslaught : We must not yield even a single world to the Legion. Continue our Invasion Point offensive and crush the Legion beneath your heel.
6454,"The Light Mother : We must know for sure whether the Light Mother survived, <name>.Xe'ra was weakened by sending her heart to Azeroth, but she is the prime naaru. She is the Light, and she cannot fade.Let's head into the Xenedar and look for her. Light willing, she will return to guide us once more."
6455,Fel-Ravaged Tome : Much of the elven writing in the tome has been singed by fel fire.The head of the curators in Dalaran is renowned for his restoration skills.  Perhaps he can treat the tome to bring it back to legibility.
6456,"Relics of the Ancient Eredar : I failed Arkhaan. I won't fail again.   If there is to be any hope of freeing the krokul, the ethereal threat must be removed from Eredath. L'ura has been vanquished, but the void clings heavily near the Shadowguard Incursion.  Before we commence, ensure your forces are protected from the shadow. Your champions should seek ancient eredar armaments in the nearby ruins."
6457,"The New Blood : It is time to begin the ritual, warlock. Be prepared, for the summoning we perform today will be more challenging than any you have known or seen before.Are you ready?"
6458,Let Sleeping Giants Lie : We're going to need a diversion to get close to Prince Oceanus. Are you thinking what I'm thinking?  See Sleepy Dhow over there? He's guarding all of the weapons the giants take from our shipwrecks. We can use those weapons to arm the rest of the pit fighters that are held in the caves.  All you have to do is get past that giant without waking him.
6459,"To Tame the Drekirjar : The Bonespeaker's words trouble me, outsider. The darkness he speaks of, Skovald's fel curse, could he have passed it onto me somehow?  No, it cannot be so. The Runeseer must be mistaken...  Come, the next challenger awaits. I will no doubt need your assistance bringing him to heel as well."
6460,"Feltotem's Fall : Our Highmountain contact, Navarrogg, reports that Tugar Bloodtotem has finally resurfaced.He's sent a message crystal along with some instructions for me.I can teleport you to Navarrogg and he will take you to Tugar's location, but there is one problem.Navarrogg requires additional magical power to fend off Tugar's fel magicks. You will need some Nethershards before you go."
6461,"Woah, Nelly! : <name>, you have my thanks. My Wranglers should be able to take it from here. If I can ask one more favor, would you pass a message to Chieftain Hatuun? Tell him the forest is secure once again. I'm sure he will reward you for all of your effort.  I'll loan you one of my fastest Cragscalers for the trip. Make sure to look both ways before crossing that path outside this forest, there's a giant Legion Obliterator that patrols there. Good luck!"
6462,Arkhaan's Pain : Darkness envelops us... the Light has gone from this place...<Arkhaan mumbles to himself before noticing you are still talking to him.>Arkhaan could not save them. Brothers. Sisters. Whispers twisted them. The Light cannot see them. It turns away from us.Arkhaan failed.<Arkhaan stares off into space.>
6463,"Daio the Decrepit : That text lists someone named Daio as being instrumental to the demonic ritual. They can't possibly mean Daio the Decrepit!I never knew he was Kirin Tor. I only know him as an elderly warlock who trains young recruits in the infernal arts. This would certainly explain his change of occupation.He most likely holds key information for this to work. Though retired, I believe he is still out in the Tainted Scar in the Blasted Lands. You should seek him out."
6464,"The Arcway: Long Buried Knowledge : Beneath Suramar City is an ancient network of tunnels known as the Arcway.  They were abandoned some time ago as part of the cavern became unstable. Since then, who knows?  Regardless of what is currently down there, I believe you will find something essential to our continued success.  Long ago my people took a thorough survey of the ley lines in and around Suramar. This they would have stored in the library in the Arcway.   Find this map for me."
6465,Seek the Unsavory : This is just... unspeakable.  Margaux risked everything to get these mana wyrms to us. I cannot let it end this way.  I need you to find someone who can make this right. Someone who will do whatever it takes to see Overseer Durant slain.  Speak with Vanthir. I am certain he will know exactly who we need.
6466,"Tyrande's Command : Shal'aran is bursting at the seams with refugees and rebels. We practically have an army now but not enough weapons or mana to keep everyone armed and un-withered.And in all of this, Tyrande has a battery of requests I simply do not have the time to deal with.Will you go to her? Her growing army is hard to miss in Meredil."
6467,"Return to the Broken Shore : Fear not, <name>. I'm angry, but I don't chase my own death.We will fly in and scout the ideal point of attack. The demons are still drunk on their victory, but we will put a swift end to their revelry!Take my spare mount and we will fly to the Broken Shore. There we will bring honor to our dead."
6468,"The Farmsteads : Forgive us, stranger. Mayor Heathrow has been under a lot of stress recently.I can't blame him: his own daughter, Penelope, has been missing for two days.In fact, we could use information on several farmsteads to the south: Mayor Heathrow's house, Granny Marl's farm, and the Radcliffes' dock. Can you go check on the situation out there?Help us, and perhaps the mayor's heart will soften."
6469,Gatekeeper's Challenge: Mastery : Archimonde was an individual consumed by the pursuit of power. Only those who could match his lust would fare well under his tutelage.You will fight what remains of Archimonde's greatest pupils. These three once held such power in their own disciplines that the Conservatory remembers them now.Their echoes will try to kill you.Best all three with all your limbs intact and I will recognize your strength.
6470,From Darkness : I'm afraid it's only a matter of time before our presence is known.We must begin our preparations at once.
6471,"Leyline Feed: Halls of the Eclipse : <The leyline feed appears to be intact and undamaged, but is not functioning. An infusion of Ancient Mana should be enough to render it operational again.>"
6472,"An Eye for a Scepter : Sounds simple? Make nice with Shadow Council friend must... for now. Help with ritual enough to gain trust, then turn tables!Council made portal device to Tol Barad here. Go, help Shadow Council find Eye of Dalaran, earn spot in big ritual! Then steal Scepter!Calydus will try to keep eye on friend when possible."
6473,
6474,"Illidari Freedom : <The Illidari demon hunter is bleeding from several ghastly wounds. It appears he was left here to die.>Within the prison are three of my... <cough>... comrades.We were taken by surprise while scouting the area.I am not long for this world, but please, save them."
6475,"The Shardmaidens : Long have I walked this land and I have seen many forms of corruption.  The creatures that wander this hall are twisted by the magics unleashed by the failed arcan'dor. These dryads have lost their way, and cannot be saved.  You must destroy them. End their suffering."
6476,"Dawn of Justice : Thanks to your efforts, our enemy is in disarray and their defenses inoperable.  We must take the ground at the spire's base and tighten the noose around their commander's neck.  You have more than earned the honor to take the warframe into battle. We will follow your lead once the way is clear."
6477,"Boarded! : Glad to see you survived the crash. Unfortunately, so did most of the enemy's boarding party.Just the thought of those monsters setting foot on my ship makes me sick. Wipe them out, $p. For my crew... For King Wrynn...For the Alliance!"
6478,High Water : Riverbend! Is that what the Underking said?That is my home and the place where we store our winter supplies. We must make it there at all speed and warn them.Meet me there.
6479,The Nightborne Pact : <Thalyssra winces and holds her abdomen.>  Ngh... I can ignore this wound no longer.  Help me patch this up. I will explain everything.
6480,"Dark Machinations : Eredar are adept at manipulating the fel that courses through this world. Those who do not shape it into living weapons build other armaments, like the Spires of Woe.  The spires will make it difficult for even a small force to penetrate the main stronghold. We must dismantle enough of them to clear the way before we advance upon it."
6481,"Intense Concentration : This is a rare treat, I hope you know. Not just anyone is allowed to stand on this hallowed ground.  <Sylverin adjusts his cuffs in a dignified fashion.>  To participate in the demonstration, simply take up an energy vessel and wade into the pool beside us.   Catch the delicate dewdrops of Nightwell energy in the bowl as they fall- this is the only way one can safely manage its essence.  Once your vessel is full, proceed to our demonstration cask and gently pour the amalgamation into it.  Enjoy!"
6482,"The End of the Saga : Ye should read the saga yerself, it's right here.  We're here to speak to the spirit of that vrykul I spoke of. Tahu Sagewind is a powerful Seer and he should be able to bring his spirit back. It will be up to us to convince him to speak.  You should speak with Tahu so we can get started."
6483,
6484,"Before the Siege : So many years of my life spent studying within the Nighthold...   Never had I considered that I would one day have to fight my way back in.  Time is short. The battle will be upon us soon.   Please, continue our tradition and feed another refugee the fruit of the arcan'dor."
6485,"The Command Center : Well done <name>. In testament to the efforts of all forces fighting here, we have come together to complete the construction of the Command Center.  All that remains is for you to inspect our work, and complete the construction."
6486,Needs of the Hunters : The eagle appears to have a message for you: |cFF660000             To: <name>|rThe time has come to strike back at the Legion.Meet me at Hunter's Reach in Dalaran as soon as you can.|cFF660000             |r-Emmarel Shadewarden
6487,
6488,"Scout It Out : You've proven that a gnome can shoot a rifle, and that's no easy feat, but a true test of Addie's skill will be to see if she can track down an elusive beast.  Rumor has it that a ravenous roc circles the basin, cursed by harpy magic, but no one's seen the beast up close.  Take this flare, and shoot it into the sky once you've spotted the roc. When we see the signal, the huntin' party will rush in and help bring down that magnificent bird!"
6489,"Scenes from a Memory : Theryn is at the mercy of his own mind. Whatever we find in there, it may be difficult to control.  I will need your help to sort through the visions, so be ready for anything.  With any luck, we will discover what makes Theryn special. And... whether there is anything left of who he used to be."
6490,"Poisoned Crops : After driving us from the farmland and infesting our crops with insects, the drogbar placed wicked totems that further poison our harvest.  I can only hope that if you destroy them, we'll be able to heal the land using Jale's water magic.  Thank you for coming to help us, <name>. We are but simple farmers and fishermen, and have little prowess in combat."
6491,"One of the People : It is time for you to enter the city proper, <name>.  I am sending you to my loyal friend Vanthir. I do hope you remember him- I can guarantee that he remembers you.  I will not be able to accompany you, but I must stress that the disguise I have granted you is not impervious. Tread carefully, and avoid those who stare too long.  Farewell for now."
6492,"Regroup : These people may be able to hold out here, but I know for certain that we cannot.Every moment we spend here places them in danger of Elisande's forces retaliating against us.We need to move. We need to find a place to regroup and recover.Follow me. I think I know how we can get out of here."
6493,"The Shrine of Ashamane : The mighty Ancient, Ashamane, fell in battle against the Burning Legion ten thousand years ago. To honor her sacrifice, a group of devoted druids called the Ashen forged Ashamane's fangs into powerful daggers.Take my signet and present it to their leader, Delandros Shimmermoon. He will know that you have my blessing.Our flight master, Danise Stargazer, can see you to the shrine."
6494,"Where the Hammer Falls : You saved us all, shaman! Thank you!Thrall wants to dive right into the Maelstrom and retrieve the Doomhammer, but I worry - he was badly wounded in that last fight, and that demon Geth'xun may still be alive down there. We should go with him.Hop on Stormbeak when you're ready and we'll track down that artifact!"
6495,"Gathering Light : Alleria and I long for more time with our son, but we cannot afford to wait any longer, <name>. We must strike now.The Army of the Light is scattered, but not defeated. Any survivors should have stayed near the crash site of the Xenedar. If there is any hope of victory, we must rally them and rescue Xe'ra.With the pit lords dealt with, we should have a safer route to the Xenedar. Meet me in the krokul hovel as soon as you can."
6496,"The Dead and the Damned : <A powerful mind again touches your thoughts.>Gorelix the Fleshripper is a monstrous demon. The butcher of a thousand worlds, he has exterminated countless races with his axe, the Maw of the Damned.A group of Ebon Blade was dispatched to slay him but they have gone missing. You will succeed where they failed.You will not be alone in this, I've sent Baron Sliver ahead to assist you.Go, obtain the Maw of the Damned and ensure that Gorelix is no more."
6497,Infiltrating Shipwreck Arena : The giants at Shipwreck Arena are very fond of smashing ships that sail too close to shore. They take the sailors prisoner and use them for their own amusement.  I suppose it will be easy for you to infiltrate the place. It's breaking out that will be the difficult part.
6498,"Vote of Confidence : I will endeavor to protect my son until the votes are cast.  Coryn Stelleris is a predator even among the nobility. It does not surprise me that he should stoop to such depths to ensure his own success.  Tell Ly'leth that she has my support. Unequivocally.  You may also choose to tell her that Coryn Stelleris will hurt her, if she gives him a chance.  Be careful."
6499,"Wolf Pack Attack : It's time to attack the pack! I've preloaded the hand cannon. All you have to do is point and shoot.  The critters should survive the blast and hit the ground running. The howlers will be distracted by the critters, allowing you to focus on killing the packleaders.  Happy hunting!"
6500,"The Defiler's Legacy : It seems you are not so easily deterred. Very well.Your deeds qualify you to seek the Sigil. To be clear, I am only permitting you to move on. This does not guarantee your success.The greatest of your challenges lies before you.You must go to the Praetorium and face Archimonde himself. Only by defeating the master of the Conservatory will you be worthy of the Sigil.Few have overcome this obstacle. I hope he does not make too much of a mess of you."
6501,The Council's Call : I'm sorry that I haven't kept your apprised of the situation. We needed more actionable information before bringing the matter before you.  The Council of the Six has been investigating Legion threats outside of the Broken Shore. I believe this scroll to be the final piece of information we need.  Meet me in Dalaran at the Violet Citadel. We will need the other members of the Council.
6502,"Eyes of the Dragon : You should travel at once to Coldarra in Borean Tundra, <name>. There, I would recommend you scout out a few key locations and report back to me.   I know the area well, and should be able to tell you how to proceed.  Make haste!"
6503,"Balance: The Twisted Twin : I have a request from an old friend, Karam Magespear, to help find his brother, Raest. Karam fears that Raest is dealing with dark powers, and wishes to stop him.  Originally Raest trained with the Kirin Tor, but such were his aspirations of power that he turned to the forbidden art of Necromancy. He was discovered and expelled from our order.  Find Karam in the Legerdemain Lounge and see if you can lend a hand.  |cFF660000Specialization: Balance Druid|r"
6504,"Our Very Bones : You seek the Tidestone of Golganneth?Yes, I know where it lies. It is in a place to which I prefer not to return.You may be of use to me. In the midst of this naga attack, those horrid fish-men flopped their way onto my lands and raided our graveyards. They steal the bones of our ancestors, and indeed, the very bones of my people.Help me bring some solace to my people. Then I shall tell you more about the Tidestone."
6505,Vengeance : The Army of the Light will not have fallen in vain.Our forces will assault the main encampment while we destroy their siege weapon.This will be but the beginning of our vengeance.
6506,"The Elements Call... : Nobundo is right. Conventional tactics will not work against the Legion - the Broken Shore taught us that. We must scour the world for weapons to use against the Legion!The Doomhammer is missing and must be recovered. Rehgar and Erunak have some other ideas, as well. Whatever our course, we must act immediately.Speak with me to go over your options, but the final decision is yours!"
6507,"Overwhelming Power : We will find no sanctuary on this world. Even now the full might of the Burning Legion rises to defend Argus.The siege camp below overflows with demon filth that stand between us and the weapon trained on the Vindicaar.They must be dealt with before it can fully charge, or Argus will be our grave."
6508,"A Touch of Fel : Our warframe is almost operational! It just needs a good jolt to revitalize its systems.  Warlocks in the pools below infuse pieces of Argus with fel energy to create living siege weapons. If you can extract one, we can use it to jumpstart the warframe's Judgment Core!"
6509,"Spark of Imagination : I've diverted all non-essential power to prepare for Hati's reformation, so I cannot teleport you to Ulduar from here.  Be extremely careful with the Thunderspark on your way. It is charged with highly volatile energy. One wrong bump could lead to serious complications!"
6510,
6511,"Supplies From the Army of the Light : Archenon poros, champion.  The Army of the Light wishes to thank you for your aid against the Legion's forces on Argus.  Please accept these supplies with our gratitude. Your continued support brings us ever closer to our ultimate goal of eradicating the Legion once and for all."
6512,"Drowned Mana : How did you end up out here?  Ah well, that's neither here nor there at this point.  What matters is that I need your help!  I see you have some experience fishing. Think you could put that skill to use for me?"
6513,"Lightly Roasted : Can you hear me, <name>? Good.Light's Judgment has been installed on the Vindicaar. We should be able to harness its power immediately.We can use it both to clear the rubble blocking the Xenedar as well as destroy our enemies.As with any new piece of technology, we should test it out. Thoroughly. I trust you have plenty of targets down there."
6514,
6515,
6516,"The Tome of Blighted Implements : The book you carry is the key to your friends' salvation, and to your absolute power! It holds within information about many relics too dangerous to the Legion to leave unchecked.  Read, friend. And decide which of these artifacts you will use to strike Jagganoth down!"
6517,"Signs of Resistance : Our forces sustained heavy losses defending the Vindicaar, <name>. We require allies.The Army of the Light was known to take in survivors of the Legion's crusade to bolster their ranks. We must do the same.I sense the presence of the Legion slaves you freed nearby. I suspect that they have carved out a resistance against their masters.I would appreciate your company, $p."
6518,"The Witchqueen : The time has come to assault High Crawliac, the Witchqueen.You should know that one does not become queen of the harpies through kindness.This creature has killed, betrayed, and tormented countless tauren, harpies, kobolds, and anything else she had to in order to secure her position as queen.Come, friend, let us finish this."
6519,
6520,
6521,"Whispers from Oronaar : Ethereals, the Void, a Dark Naaru... I feel they are all connected.I explored the ruins below while you and Velen were seeking the Crown. There are survivors, <name>.Broken wander the cluster of buildings to our west- I cannot understand much of what they say but I suspect that their minds are not their own.If the Void is to blame, we will need to start our investigation there.I will conduct my own search in the meantime."
6522,"A Non-Prophet Organization : I have complete faith that Velen is nearby. We would know if he had been captured.All the same, we must not delay. The Legion has a vested interest in finding him after all he has done to resist them. I shudder to think what they might do, given the chance.That is why I am going with you.We will find Velen and help him track down the Crest of Knowledge. We must have faith in his mission or all will be lost."
6523,"Guardian: Aid of the Illidari : Thankfully, we are not quite alone in uncovering the Legion's plots to infiltrate the city.Kor'vas Bloodthorn of the Illidari has taken to patrolling the city streets on her own to find the source behind the recent attacks.I do not entirely trust these 'demon hunters', but they have at least proved adept at their namesake. I suggest you find her and see what she has uncovered before the Legion strikes once more.  |cFF660000Specialization: Guardian Druid|r"
6524,"Scavenging the Shallows : The kvaldir exist to spite Odyn, and it is here their spiteful work is done. They rob the souls of the living - the souls not yet judged - thus robbing Odyn of his champions.  They bring them here to transport to Helya, though the mists obscure any indications of how.  You seem to fare the mists well. Perhaps if you search the wreckage in the bay, the answer may present itself. You outsiders seem to have a knack for uncovering the most hidden of secrets."
6525,"Long Overdue : I have learned much. High Inquisitor Raalgar has moved to a base near the Legion citadel across the mountains. This is where he keeps the Fel Heart of Argus, the source of his immortality, and it is powered by wells leading directly to the core of Argus. He is preparing to attack so you will strike first. Mark the location of the wells and I will rain holy fire upon them with the Vindicaar's guns. With that connection to the fel on Argus broken, Raalgar can be killed and the Fel Heart retrieved."
6526,"An Argus Roper : My warriors stand no chance against even the smallest of the Legion's forces without our Cragscalers. If you can capture a few and bring them here, my warriors can better defend our people."
6527,"Lord of the Spire : Lord Nath'raxas rules over this hold as thanks for his role in delivering Argus to the Legion many years ago.  Make no mistake, he is powerful, but he has also grown overconfident in his seat.  Take advantage of his hubris and make use of the warframe's firepower while you can. We will storm the courtyard shortly!"
6528,Tying Up Loose Ends : Malfurion Stormrage managed to make landfall in Val'sharah and has already taken care of things there. It seems our fortune is finally turning around!He's waiting for you as we speak in Lorlathil. Life is so magical when everything goes according to plan.
6529,
6530,"To the Deeps : I assure you the legends are true: Sharas'dal, the Scepter of Tides, was forged around living waters of the Well of Eternity. It gave Azshara dominion over life itself. I have sent shaman throughout the world looking for it, but the only one to ever find it has gone missing.Wavespeaker Adelee said she had tracked the scepter to the Ruins of Vashj'ir, but we haven't heard from her since.<name>! Come with me to the ocean depths. Let's track down our missing shaman and get that artifact!"
6531,"The Shadows Reveal : The Fangs of the Devourer are wielded by Akaari Shadowgore, one of Kil'Jaeden's personal assassins. Every attempt on her life ends the same... she's gone before we even arrive.<Valeera scrawls a few lines on a piece of paper, then hands it to you.>But not this time. We've been working with these contacts to find Akaari so we can finally take the Fangs for our own purposes.Go to each contact and tell them ""The shadows reveal."" See what they know."
6532,"Sky Ablaze With Cannonfire : Oh! It's me! And <name>, was it? I remember this!I seem to have found myself in the middle of a battle between the Horde and the Alliance, which wouldn't USUALLY be a big deal, except for that enormous cannon that seems to be trained on me anytime I try to fly away.Think you could take it out for me?"
6533,"Bringing the Big Guns : Light's Judgment has a security feature to prevent it from falling into enemy hands. We can trigger its recall mechanism, which will teleport it back to a vessel.With the Xenedar out of commission, the gun should recall to your ship instead. You can make good use of its firepower.The process takes time, though, and will likely attract the Legion's attention. Be on your guard."
6534,"The Power Possessed : I was wrong about you, warlock. Your assistance against the Dark Riders has proven a great service to the Light. Perhaps I should not be so quick to judge.  Nevertheless, you have allowed me to fill my purpose in returning these artifacts to their rightful owners. As for Ulthalesh, I can think of no safer place than in your care.   May it serve you well against the Legion, warlock."
6535,
6536,"Vengeance: Seeking Kor'vas : Thankfully, we are not quite alone in uncovering the Legion's plots to infiltrate the city.One of your Illidari, Kor'vas Bloodthorn, has taken to patrolling the city streets on her own to find the source behind the recent attacks.I do not entirely trust your kind, but I will concede that you have at least proved adept at your namesake. I suggest you find Kor'vas and see what she has uncovered before the Legion strikes once more.  |cFF660000Specialization: Vengeance Demon Hunter|r"

6538,"The Haunted Halls : Now, what was it you wanted? You're here to see the Tidestone of Golganneth? Hah! Ho ho ha ha haa!Hooo my.No, only the academy's headmistress has the keys to that chamber, and she hasn't opened the door in... oh, I'd say about ten thousand years.You'd best be off to class, now. Go on, then! Into the west wing with you!"
6539,"Apocalypse : <The Lich King's chill voice fills your mind once again>  There is an ancient blade, lost in the echoes of time, that has the power to bring my vengeance upon the Legion.   It is known as Apocalypse.  I've sensed the blade in the possession of the Dark Riders of Deadwind Pass. Their magic conceals them from my sight but they cannot hide from the scourge! They were last seen by my agents near a place called Manor Mistmantle.  Go there, <name>. Defeat the Dark Riders, and claim the blade!"
6540,Unlikely Seduction : Mo... Modera sent you?  No...  you must... leave!  Agatha will be back any moment!  Save... yourself...
6541,"Procuring a Prototype : If Addie's going to be a more permanent member of the huntin' party, then she'll need some specialty gear for someone her size.  My munitions expert should have some ideas about what kind of weapon would best suit a gnome.  Stop by his camp and let him know that I'll be needin' a prototype soon."
6542,"Never Hunt Alone : Prustaga is almost certainly on her way to the Temple of Storms, which is where I imbued Titanstrike with the Thunderspark.If my deductions are correct, she'll attempt to reverse the process and infuse the spark into herself, thus attaining the godlike power she craves!Hopefully Thorim isn't off cavorting with his hounds again. If Prustaga has the local vrykul on her side, things may get... complicated."
6543,Flanking Maneuvers : I will take command of Fareeya's lieutenants and we will escort Velen to the Crest of Knowledge. His mission must not fail.We face an old foe-- one the Army of the Light has encountered on numerous occasions. Talgath will try to block us in and prevent our retreat.You must not let that happen. Find out how he is bringing in his forces and cut them off. All we need is time to get in and get out.We are counting on you.
6544,"Powering Down the Portal : Destroying the crystals will stop them temporarily, but it will be meaningless if we do not deal with the person controlling the portal itself.I heard their overseer, Ingra, shouting orders for more power so that she could bring the stronger Legion lieutenants through the gate. We must stop her to truly seal the portal for good."
6545,"Return to the Vindicaar : That pit lord won't trouble our new allies any longer.<Turalyon's brow furrows.>Until another takes its place, at least. If there's one thing I've learned in our endless war against the Legion, it's to savor victories as you find them.Come, let us take a moment to regroup back at your vessel. Alleria and I have been waiting a long time for a reunion with our son."
6546,"Priestly Matters : <Master/Mistress> <name>, I come at the behest of one who seeks to organize a stronger resistance to the Legion threat.If you would meet him at Faol's Rest in Tirisfal Glades, he will guarantee both your safety and an opportunity to play a pivotal role in the conflict."
6547,"Bitestone Enclave : This is an old drogbar enclave that we used to trade with. Now it is a base of operations for their raids.I need more time to gather what is left of our warbraves. Go, enter the enclave, and slay any you find in there.Buy us the time we need to gather our strength."
6548,"Citizens' Army : I can barely get these civilians to stand in a straight line.They are untrained, undisciplined, and underarmed.Still, they need to be ready for the real battle.Khadgar suggested we try some field training at the ruins of Black Rook Hold in Val'sharah. The risen forces of Lord Ravencrest apparently remember how to fight.Go, hero, and I will send some trainees to support you."
6549,Into the Crevasse : I have protected that seed for ten thousand years. You let it fall into the hands of the fal'dorei.I should have let you die.Repay your debt. Help me get the seed back.
6550,"Intercepting the Legion's Plans : Our scout Skara writes in the missive that she learned of a major Legion initiative. She was after two encoded orders held by Legion troops near us to get the details and this must be when she was killed. The Legion splits their messages into encoded parts so that we cannot read them. Skara also writes that her partner Brae, a codebreaker, was slain trying to reach our lines with a code book that we will need to translate the Legion's orders. It is vital you find the orders and that code book!"
6551,"Ready for Battle : Thanks to your efforts and a lot of effort on the part of our new army, the Nightfallen are prepared for battle.What is more, we have managed to evacuate nearly all of the civilians between here and Astravar Harbor.I have drafted plans that can lead our combined forces through the city and take the harbor.Can you deliver these plans to Vereesa, Tyrande and Liadrin?"
6552,"Gatekeeper's Challenge: Tenacity : My master Archimonde was not known for his willingness to suffer indecision.He preferred to teach by rewarding frustration with more frustration-- punishment with more punishment. Absolute conviction was required to succeed under him.At the opposite end of the Conservatory you will find a large structure. Once inside, your goal is to overcome all the obstacles placed before you. Emerge unscathed and I will be forced to consider your will strong enough to proceed."
6553,"Maw of Souls: Piercing the Mists : In a time before memory, the Naglfar was the prize of Helya's fleet. It would seem that it has lived on to serve her once more.  Now, the dread ship sails the sea of souls, and cuts through the mist unseen by the living. The kvaldir must have a way to summon her, and this is what you must seek.  Find her berth and board the Naglfar. Put an end to the dread ship, and the souls of the Tideskorn may be redeemed."
6554,"Return to Mardum : The gateway is fully functional, <name>. Ooh, I am positively tingling with excitement!Do let Jace and the others know that we eagerly await your arrival. There's so much to do and ever so little time.You will be joining us aboard, won't you?"
6555,"Arcane Unleashed : You have the power you need to destroy the Surge Needles.   At the location of the breaches where the Surge Needles pierce the ground, there will be a large concentration of void energy. Focus the power of Aluneth into these points. The reaction should cause an overload, destroying the Surge Needle above.  You must act quickly. The Ethereum won't sit idly by as you lay waste to their machinations."
6556,"Learning From the Dead : I heard you were traveling to Black Rook Hold.It was once home to the legendary Lord Ravencrest, a brilliant tactician. His knowledge may be exactly what we need to give us an edge against the Duskwatch.While you are at the Rook, keep your eyes peeled for any books that might have survived the ages that outline the Ravencrest's strategems."
6557,Trouble Has Huge Feet : The Ettin's hide bears many shallow scratch marks and bite scars. It seems he had been terrorizing the local Owlcats for quite some time.  Mardranel Forestheart would be interested in this.
6558,A Challenge From Our Enemies : Make no mistake. This message cannot be taken lightly. Any threat made against our people will be dealt with swiftly.We must travel to the estate at once to discover what has become of Ly'leth.
6559,"Oh, the Clawdacity! : The leader of the Cavemoss makrura, Clawdayshus, has been ordering raids into the Cavemoss village to steal the young for snacks.  This isn't going to do at all. In order to prove their power, Murky and the tadpoles must destroy him as well!  This is a job for murlocs.  Mindmeld with Murky in his egg and show him how it's done!"
6560,
6561,"Scars of the Past : The Army of the Light's warframes have won countless battles on Argus. Despite their power, not all who descend into the fray return.  My modifications to this frame should give us the edge we need, but several critical components are still missing.  There are remains of battles past in Nath'raxas that we can still scavenge. If you can find the pieces I need, the Legion will feel our fury yet."
6562,"Grasp of the Underking : If we have one good fortune in this it is that Dargrul has no knowledge of how to use the hammer.He keeps thinking of the hammer as a weapon instead of a tool of creation.Even so, he has imprisoned our tribesman in fists of stone summoned from the earth. Our weapons have proven useless against this magic.You might have power enough to break these fists. Can you help?"
6563,"One Step Behind : It looks like Raest is out of our reach, but at least his cultists should prove less of a threat.  We should return to the Kirin Tor. They should be able to help us plan our next move."
6564,Rating Razik : Hemet is expecting an update on how my munitions research and development is going.  I'm sure you'll be happy to tell my boss that my latest creation worked flawlessly!  You can find him at his camp near the hunters' lodge.
6565,"Heart of a Dragon : Through brute force and corruption, the God-King has taken the power you seek, but there may be hope for you and the Thorignir, <class>.  With the aid of fel powers such as I've never seen, the Felskorn are corrupting our young and seeking to enslave the Thorignir. Their leader, a demon of great power, has captured our mother and seeks to bend her to the God-King's will.  Find her and free her from the demon's grasp - only then might the Thorignir regain our power and grant you aid."
6566,"Moozy's Reunion : You will never know how thankful we are to you, <race>. Because of you, Moozy and my husband are safe. I won't let either of them out of my sight!  I am sorry to ask one last favor of you, but do you think you could find my mother and bring her here so she can see that her grandchild is safe?  Her name is Ethel, and her home is on the northern bluff of Thunder Totem."
6567,"Survival of the Fittest : The collar you took from the trapper is simple, but effective. Affixing the collar to a target will make them complacent and obedient to their Nightborne masters. Lilryia was able to reverse the spell using the traps you found.The magics in the collar can now be used to cancel out the other collars.How about giving the Nightborne a reminder that nature always finds a way?"
6568,"Gates of the Nighthold : Our combined armies are arrayed in front of the palace, ready to strike! I cannot believe the time has come.  Your allied commanders are already there and we will join you. Make your way to Astravar Harbor and speak with Khadgar. He is coordinating the attack, or at least I think he is.  See you there... and thanks for everything."
6569,"Step into the Dark : With the threat to my people quelled, I believe it is time to introduce you to my kin.  Meet me at Stonedark Grotto, and you will see where we live."
6570,"Frenzied Furbolgs : I would help you seek audience with the Archdruid, but we have a difficult situation on our hands.The nearby furbolgs have gone into a frenzied rage.For days, it has been all we can do to protect our grove from their aggression.They have cut off our access to the barrow dens, where the Archdruid and our clan sleep in the Emerald Dream.In order to awaken them, we must first get past the furbolg."
6571,"Secrets of Highmountain : Mayla's father, Ulan, was our last high chieftain. He was slain trying to stop the Underking from seizing the Hammer of Khaz'goroth.I have watched Mayla all her life and can tell you she has both the courage and the strength to wear the mantle of High Chieftain.She needs only our help to realize it herself.Will you meet us at the city entrance along the southern bluff? There is a ritual that might help, but we will need your aid to survive it."
6572,"A Grim Equation : They were waiting for us when we crashed. It was all we could do to establish our small outpost.Even now they drain the souls of our fallen to fuel their attacks.Destroy their soul coffers. Free our comrades and let them join the Light.When you have finished, find Y'mera in the field. She has been sorely missed, but she will not have fallen. Of this I am certain."
6573,"Glaive Circumstances : I came here on a mission to slay the demon eredar, Azoran. During my infiltration, I was shot down from my felbat and captured.I'm not going to mince words, <name>. Azoran plans to use the Burning Legion command ship to destroy Dalaran.To stop him, I will need my warglaives that were lost during my fall from the sky. I would retrieve them myself, but I'm still weakened from my imprisonment.Search for the warglaives on the northern side of the crater, where I was shot down."
6574,Bubble Trouble : <class>! The sea giants have already eaten half of my kin.We are helpless in these accursed bubbles. I beseech you to get us out of here.Take heed. These bubbles are strong. You will need something that is extremely sharp to pierce them.
6575,"The Hunger Returns : <Runas looks antsy.>I can help you, and I very much want to help you, but I'm a bit distracted. Look at all that raw, unfiltered, mouthwatering mana...<Runas slaps his own face.>No! NO! You must stay in control!I simply need to clear my head. Yes, that's it. A few of my depraved brethren carry small mana jewels around with them in case they need a quick burst of energy. Find a few for me? Then I will show you how to get your ley line back."
6576,"Kur'talos Ravencrest : Lord Ravencrest was a fearless leader, a seasoned commander, a man of integrity and honor, a teacher, and a protector of his people.Malfurion, Illidan, Tyrande, and I... we were still young when he helped shape our destinies.The sigil of his house was legendary. Observe, for a moment, the sigil over his former resting place and I shall tell you more of his legacy."
6577,Light's Return : Xe'ra has been saved! We have won an important victory here.The Light Mother should be back on the Vindicaar. No doubt she will want to speak with you. There is so much to explain...Romuul should be able to teleport us back to the ship now. Let me know when you are ready.
6578,"The Drogbar : It wasn't enough for Dargrul to just destroy this village. He has also sent his Stoneraiders to take what is left.Please champion, prove to my people that you are the hero I foresaw.Slay enough of these Stoneraiders that it breaks their resolve."
6579,"The Flow of the River : We can leave Farmer Maya in charge of the farmland now that the greatest threat has been reduced.  But we aren't out of hot water just yet, <name>. The fisheries are just as important as our fields, and they are in even greater danger than the farm if what Angler Creel says is true."
6580,
6581,"Victory is Eternal : There is no more cause for hesitation. Now is the time to strike.  We will defeat this foul behemoth and meet Helya's bargain. The path out of Helheim awaits, outsider.   Prepare yourself."
6582,"Thinly Veiled Threats : How could I let this happen?  <Aurore wrings her hands.>  Yesterday Coryn Stelleris approached me about the appointment. He sought my support, but I did not offer it.   He said my son's life would continue as normal... if I gave him my vote.  This morning my son was gone.  I can only think of the terrible things he may be suffering. You know what this family is capable of!  You want my support, but I can do nothing while my son is in danger. Nothing.  Please... save him!"
6583,"Black Rook Prison : I did not come this far to lose her in the final moments.Maiev must be in the cells beneath Black Rook Hold.I scouted above, and the entrance to the prison is guarded by a fearsome jailor.I will sneak past and take out the guards inside. Defeat Araxxas, take the keys, and then meet me within."
6584,"No Sanctuary : We have one other lead that may prove useful. Goes by Felcaller Whitley, another of the cult's elite. He's eluded our agents at every turn.Our latest reconnaissance report puts him somewhere in the village of Raven Hill in Duskwood. He's sure to have information vital to your search.You know what to do."
6585,"Given to Corruption : A final favor for an old friend, perhaps? My age-old companion, Varethos, has fallen to the nightmare's torment. We once worked in unison to protect this land. His close ties to the land brought him low in this dark hour.As with all who suffer this fate, there is no restoring him.Please, <name>, bring him peace."
6586,"Crystals Not Included : Turalyon is safe, and we can start to fight back.First things first, we must secure what supplies we can from the crash.Even though we are blessed by the Light, our ships still rely on crystal technology. From powering our defenses to arming our weapons, we will need to collect as much as we can to fight back against the enemy.Venture out into the crash and retrieve what crystals you can. While you are out there, keep an eye out for Y'mera. She was separated from us, and will need help."
6587,"Evacuate Snowmane : They just keep coming!And now my scouts report some of the drogbar have managed to sneak around our flank and are attacking Snowmane Village.Go, help the evacuation. We will hold the line here and try to buy you some time."
6588,"The King's Path : Now that I have seen the Broken Shore and the terror of the Burning Legion first hand, my eyes have been opened to the truth.  I speak not of the unfathomable evil of the enemy, but of the bravery and sacrifice that such evil brings about in the hearts of our people.  My father once told me that every king must carry the weight of his own crown. Mine has never felt heavier than it does at this very moment...  Please take me to the place where my father died, so that I may honor his sacrifice."
6589,Insurrection: Breaking the Nighthold : First Arcanist Thalyssra sends word that her forces are ready. It is time for you to lead the attack against the Nighthold.Report to Shal'Aran in Suramar for details.
6590,"The Great Akazamzarak : There is a goblin who is a master of portals and teleportation by the name of Akazamzarak. His talents have gone mostly unnoticed, however, since he mostly uses them for chicanery.  He is, what you would call, a street performer.  Fortunately for us, he is performing in the streets of Dalaran, grifting coins from the unenlightened masses.  Take this bag of gold. See if you can convince him to change vocations."
6591,Silkwing Sabotage : Moths. Who ever heard of something so... barbaric!  They are eating our crop and the mana wyrms do nothing to deter them.  You. You seem capable. Deter these creatures so we can complete our harvest on schedule.  Ahem. Please.
6592,"Meet with Mylune : It would seem we are fortuitous that you seek G'Hanir this day, <name> - the dryad Mylune arrived not long ago from the sacred shrine where the staff has been guarded for many centuries.Few are privy to its hidden location within the roots of Shaladrassil, but you have certainly earned that right.Speak to Mylune when you are ready to depart - I saw her last just east of here up the hill."
6593,"Hatchlings of the Talon : Greetings, hatchling. Do you wish to soar amongst the clouds as my children do?  <Aviana chuckles - a clicking, crow-like noise.>  Very well, receive my blessing and we shall see how developed your wings are."
6594,"Chaos Theory : Despite their strength and their numbers, even the Burning Legion requires order to fight. Disrupt that order... and they fall like the rabble they are.  The plan is simple. Let chaos reign in their ranks, and the day will be ours."
6595,"Ceremonial Drums : Those foolish calves!  They've made off with our ceremonial drums again, treating them as toys... as... common drums!  Can you help me find them? They must be scattered to all corners of Thunder Totem by now, discarded as soon as the fun dries up."
6596,"Growing Strong : Magic has long been a vice of the elves. It shaped us, and lifted us out of the darkness - but without balance, it also threatens to unmake us.The shal'dorei are too proud to admit it, but they are the product of indulgence. They live without harmony.But I sense potential among the Nightfallen. Losing everything has humbled them. It has made them stronger.Stay the course, $p. Help the Nightfallen rise up."
6597,
6598,"Feral: The Folly of Levia Laurence : Levia Laurence was once a member of the Kirin Tor. Dabbling in shadow magic got her banned from the city, but she knows the streets too well to keep her out for good.  Levia has disappeared, and I'm gravely concerned. Her work may have attracted the attention of the Legion. It has before. It would be very dangerous if her knowledge fell into their hands.  She was last seen at the Scribe's Sacellum. Ask around there and see if you can pick up her trail.  |cFF660000Specialization: Feral Druid|r"
6599,"Legacy of the Icebreaker : The greatest warrior should wield the greatest weapons. Long ago a great king, Magnar Icebreaker, wielded weapons crafted from a scale of the mightiest dragon in the land. He should be here, but he is not. Instead he languishes in his tomb.  His son, Hruthnir, is here. He will lead you to the tomb. If Magnar can be saved, do so. Either way, return with his weapons."
6600,"Commander on Deck! : <The device hums to life, ready to provide you with access to Squadron Commander Vishax's portal in the Antoran Wastes.>"

6602,"The Advisor and the Arcanist : This new First Arcanist appointed by Elisande. This... Andaris. If she is as dangerous as I have heard, then Ly'leth may well be lost.  I am sorry, I should not entertain such thoughts. It is just that we have received a troubling message.  Help me distribute the latest batch of the arcan'dor fruit, then we will discuss the message."
6603,"Cave of the Blood Trial : All Bloodtotem and distinguished guests must go through a trial of blood in the cavern beneath this outpost.  I hope it's a good sign that they wish you to participate in this rite of passage. You will need to show proof of your deeds, defeat a Warmonger in single combat, then perform sacrifice at an altar deep in the cavern."
6604,"Shard of Kozak : The demon leading the operation in Felsoul Hold is an eredar named Azoran. In order to get to him, we will need to open a portal to the Burning Legion command ship.Azoran has a demon jailer in his service known as Kozak the Afflictor.Kozak the Afflictor holds one of the key shards necessary to open a portal to the ship. He can be found in the prison quarters known as the Halls of the Eclipse in the lower portion of Felsoul Hold.Slay Kozak and place his key shard next to the portal."
6605,Dreamcatcher : I cannot hold on for much longer...  I brought a dreamcatcher with me. I was to use it to steal the magic from owlbeast totems.  It is the only way to break the barrier where they hold Keeper Remulos.  Please help where I have failed.
6606,"Wavespeaker's Trail : The shaman we seek is Wavespeaker Adelee. Her research brought her down to these ancient ruins, where she reported naga armies amassing prior to the Legion invasion.The last I had heard, she had located Sharas'dal, the Scepter of Tides - and then she went silent.<name>, Search for clues to her whereabouts among the lower level of the ruins. Beware the naga patrols!"
6607,"An Unworthy Task : This place is Helheim, the realm of the unworthy dead. Here, the spirits of the dishonorable spend eternity in an endless futile battle, always seeking glory but never able to attain it.  We should not be here.  We must find a way out. I will scout ahead - you should try and release some of these captive spirits here. Perhaps one may have some answers for us."
6608,"This IS In My Contract. : To perform my ritual I need to use a special cave I have prepared at Gloombound Barrow.Meet me there and I will ""give"" you your reward. Hee hee."
6609,"Nath'raxas Hold: Preparations : One of two fates await krokul prisoners taken to Nath'raxas Hold. Consume the fel, and become a willing soldier in the infinite army, or be mutated into a disfigured abomination. An ur'zul.  While the Army of the Light occupies the Legion's attention, I am presented with an opportunity to save my people. I ask for your aid.  Before we begin, your forces must be adequately equipped."
6610,
6611,"Love Lost : Malfurion, my love...In vision I saw him, enraged and then distressed, and now lost beyond my mind's reach.He is strong, but the horrors that have befallen this land are all-consuming.I must find him, and you must help me!Gather your wits, <race>, and follow me."
6612,
6613,
6614,"Totemic Call : I heard the others talking earlier. I may know the cause of their fear.They say the Chieftain has a mysterious totem. It gives him power, and fearful visions.If you destroy the totem, the madness will end."
6615,"Heart of the Nightmare : I know only that my husband is somewhere deeper in this twisted forest.He is still alive, but it remains to be seen if he is whole.<Tyrande's expression hardens into a scowl as she peers at you.>Elune herself cannot protect Xavius if he is not."
6616,"The Call of Vengeance : I was wrong about you, death knight. Your assistance against the Dark Riders has proven a great service to the Light. Perhaps I should not be so quick to judge.  Nevertheless, you have allowed me to fill my purpose in returning these artifacts to their rightful owners. As for Apocalypse, I can think of no safer place than in your care.   May it serve you well against the Legion, death knight."
6617,Consecrating Ground : We have everything we need.In the alcove below you will find the shattered remains of the Argunite Matrix. Replacing the Keystone will restore it to full capacity.The pylons you activated will then be able to repel those who still hunt my people. At long last this battle will be over.I hope it brings them peace.

6619,"The Dark Lady's Bidding : Uh, are these guys friendlies? I guess it's a good sign they haven't tried to eat Duchess... yet.  Anyway, I have orders. Nathanos caught up with the dark rangers, who were sent forward aboard the Oblivion on a secret mission from Lady Sylvanas herself! Unfortunately the Alliance caught wind of our plan, and now Greymane is attacking the outpost!  We could really use you over there, <name>. Duchess can take you there, just give me the word."
6620,"The Nighthold : Illidan's soul rests safely within Light's Heart. Take this vessel and deliver it to Khadgar with the following instructions:When Gul'dan attempts to tear the sky asunder and bring the dark titan into our world, call forth the power of this vessel and release Illidan's soul into his body.Go now, <name>. We do not have much time. The dark ritual will begin soon."
6621,"An Offering of Shadow : Can you sense it, <name>? The darkness within this essence is palpable.  In the past, I might have shunned such power, even denied its very existence. But what have we learned throughout our long struggle, if not that Light and shadow must coexist?  This may prove to be exactly what we need to bring balance to the Netherlight Crucible. To give us the edge we need against the Legion.  Infuse this essence into the crucible, champion. Draw one step closer to realizing your weapon's full potential."
6622,"The Mystery of Dreyrgrot : Well met, good chap!  I was on my way to study the local murlocs when I stumbled upon these most peculiar ruins. Those pirates over yonder arrived first, and it appears they've unleashed some ancient evil.  I would be remiss to let such an evil run rampant, but we should learn more of it before we proceed, lest we end up like those chaps.  I spied the crew bringing back some tablets from the ruins. If you can bring them to me, I may be able to decipher the nature of this evil."
6623,"Master of the Isles : <Only one region remains from your order's carefully laid plan to assault the Broken Isles and gather the Pillars of Creation.><Victory feels close, but studying your order's intelligence one last time couldn't hurt.>"
6624,"Dreadwake's Dilemma : The situation has taken a dire turn, <name>. We were unprepared for Greymane's sudden assault, with only a token force left behind at Dreadwake's Landing, and we are paying the toll.  The beach is now swarming with worgen infiltrators, and if the cannons breach our defenses, they will likely swarm in on us. We're spread too thin here to take the fight to them, but you could change that.  Wipe them out."
6625,"Talgath's Forces : I must continue to seek the Crest of Knowledge, my friend. Nothing short of the whole Crown of the Triumvirate can turn the tide in the battle we face.Talgath's forces stand between us and that goal. I will need you to clear a path.We can let nothing stand in our way. Not even Talgath."
6626,The Many-Faced Devourer : <The scroll's runes shift to a more intelligible form.>  An effigy. The Many-Faced One requires it.  Steal from the Imps. Steal from the Fiends. Steal from the Ur'zul.  He comes.
6627,Prince Farondis : I'm glad to see that my doubts in you were unfounded.You seek Prince Farondis? Follow me. I will show you to the prince's hall.
6628,"Darkheart Thicket: Enter the Nightmare : We could not save Ysera, but we did prevent her from destroying the temple.  Now I can finally turn my attention to my husband.  I do not know what fate he suffers now. I only know that if we stand any chance of saving him, you must go now.  Follow Xavius into the Nightmare and find Malfurion.  Please, save my husband if you can."
6629,"The Call of Battle : These demons have no honor! Rather than meet us in glorious, open-battle; they hide behind their barricades and siege weapons.  The Valarjar have come for the glory of battle and we will not be turned away by cowardly tactics!  Destroy their cannons and bring down their barriers, so that our valiant Valarjar may face them in the true spirit of battle! When the dust of battle clears, the corpses of demons shall litter the ground... and the Valarjar will stand triumphant!"
6630,"Timing Is Everything : Can you feel it, <name>? The waters churn with approaching Sashj'tar.You must strike now...Leave me... Find a way to bombard the naga... with the kegs...Protect... Jandvik..."
6631,"The Netherlight Crucible : The crucible thrums with power. Soon our weapons will shine like the stars themselves!  We will need that strength if we are to have any hope of defeating the Legion here.  <name>, you have endured great hardship to bring us to this moment. The honor of first tapping the crucible's power must be yours."
6632,"The Fruit of Our Efforts : It is my job to maintain appearances here.  <Margaux smiles apologetically.>  You will have to endure a little showmanship while I walk with you through the vineyard. It is the only way to avoid suspicion.  I will try to help you as I can, but only when it is safe to do so.  Come with me- our first stop is the tasting pavilion. There you can sample some of our work."
6633,"Supplies From the Dreamweavers : Hero!   Your dedication to defending Val'sharah has given us a much needed respite from the vile influence of the Legion. We were able to scavenge some supplies as a result of your efforts.   Here, take them and know that, should you continue to aid us, we will set aside more rewards such as these as we find them."
6634,"The Die is Cast : Thanks to your efforts the temple is safe, for now.But the Tears of Elune are stolen and Shaladrassil, the world tree that once protected this land, is now an instrument in the hands of our enemy. The Emerald Dream itself is being overrun by Nightmare.The hearts of our people falter, their faith tested like never before. Return to Ysera with my report, <name>, such as it is.I shall plead with Elune with what time I have left here. May we somehow yet prevail."
6635,"Into the Academy : The sunken structure on the other side of this bridge was once called Nar'thalas Academy: the center of magical studies in all of Azeroth. You should have seen her in her full splendor.The Tidestone should be locked up within. I dare not enter, but you - my champion - you go with my blessing."
6636,Beach Bonfire : Do not let... my body lie in... the mud.Set my flesh... aflame.
6637,"Fresh Meat : This crater is infested with felfire basilisks.They may not be the most cunning of creatures, but they are as vile and dangerous as any demon.However, they may yet prove useful to us. Slay the basilisks, but return to me with chunks of their fel-infused flesh.I have plans to make use of their freshly carved flesh..."
6638,"Conservation of Magic : I have an idea. This construct will be of use to us. We simply need to jolt it awake.We once stored great quantities of energy in conduits throughout the Conservatory. They are still functional, but only just.Take this.<Y'mera hands you a brightly glowing crystal.>It will provide a small burst of magic that should help stabilize an erratic conduit. I think I have enough stored for eight or so.Stabilizing a few should allow us to access the whole network."
6639,"What the Stonemother Knows : We must split up. I am still badly wounded from my encounter with Geth'xun, and I don't want to appear weak before the Stonemother. This task falls to you.Travel to Therazane's Throne and speak to Therazane herself. Find out if she has seen the Doomhammer.Help her if she asks. She is dangerous and mercurial, but this is her realm, and without her aid we will find nothing."
6640,"To Point the Way : Though the journal devolves into dark ramblings written in hurried scribbles, one entry stands out:  ""Ulthalesh. The name rings in my head. I can hear it calling, but where?  ""The spirits... the very land here is tied to it. It is no wonder we would so often get lost in this place. The forces pull my compass point in every direction...  ""Perhaps if it had a stronger pull, the compass could show the way..."""
6641,"Trapped Tauren : The drogbar just rounded up those of us that they could and led them to a cave near here.  If you act quickly, I think they can still be saved. I know not what purpose they have for capturing our people.  I shudder to think of it... in the deep places, the darkness rules."
6642,"Study Hall: Combat Research : What's this? A new, confused student, desperately trying to win the favor of the headmistress, wandering the halls without anything to do?Perfect! I need help with my research.I'm writing a paper on combat. Grab me some books from the shelf over there."
6643,"Helya's Conquest : If Helya is making an advance on the Broken Isles, we will need to answer in turn.  Go to Tideskorn Harbor and scout her forces. We will see if Helya is foolish enough to begin her campaign against me."
6644,"Survival: The Thieving Apprentice : The Focusing Iris has been stolen from the Dalaran Vaults! The thief was a mage of some skill, but we've been unable to track him.  Fortunately, the thief dropped a note from his master, addressing him as one of his ""apprentici."" I know of only one mage who uses that particular pluralization - Archmage Xylem.  I'll need you to investigate. In Azshara you will find his tower where he trains his apprentices. Go there, and see what Xylem is up to.  |cFF660000Specialization: Survival Hunter|r"
6645,"A Ring Reforged : Speak with Nobundo, and take your place around the circle, <name>. The Earthen Ring will rise again, with you as its leader!Within these stones stands the legendary Heart of Azeroth, which we can use as a base of operations. Perhaps the power of your artifact can unseal the hidden chambers..."
6646,"The Heart of the Dreadscar : Friend has the artifact! Now Jagganoth does not stand a chance!Quickly, you must go back to Dreadscar Rift! You may still be able to save your friends from Jagganoth's vengeance.If you take the heart of the overlord, his army will be yours to command!"
6647,"The Consumed : <The whelpling is alive, but unconscious. One of the withered must have already drained it of mana.><You've already learned that exposed ley crystals contain a small amount of magical energy. Perhaps you can use one to revive some of the whelps.>"
6648,Turtle Powered : In order to locate and purify the source of the corruption I am going to need an elemental focus.The turtles around here have developed scales that can focus and amplify their innate magics. Bring back some snapper scales and we will have these waters purified in no time!
6649,
6650,
6651,"The Longest Vigil : It was a good thing we sought two sources of energy. Even with the conduits active, the construct has not stirred.It has likely been inactive a long while. Perhaps as long as Eredath has floated above Argus.What a long, lonely vigil it must have been.<Y'mera is silent for a moment as she peers at the construct.>Go ahead and jostle it a little. That combined with one last burst of magic ought to do the trick."
6652,"Those Scrying Eyes : Until recently, Ly'leth was sending magical messages to us regularly from within the Nighthold. She took care to hide these messages - only the most vigilant scryers could have detected them.  They could not be within the palace... too much interference from the Nightwell...  Of course! The Terrace of Enlightenment! The Duskwatch must have set up a listening post there.  Check the scrying orbs for traces of Ly'leth's messages. We must learn what she was trying to tell us!"
6653,"To Old Friends : I sense a powerful dark presence here, <name>, but it is not of Xavius. This feels too familiar.I sense a druid's touch here, a druid twisted by the shadow of the Nightmare.We must deal with this threat if we are to find Xavius. I will take to the skies and lend you my aid.Find this corrupted druid and cut down his tainted and twisted plants."
6654,"Bolstering Your Arsenal : Highlord, there are still weapons that you might obtain to help you defeat the Legion. We have kept a close eye on them during your time on the Broken Isles.I would be happy to review them with you if you wish."
6655,
6656,"Where it's Thinnest : Though I have never heard of this ""Nethersworn"" cult, what this manifesto speaks of can't be good.  I do have a theory, however. The writing speaks of ""the place its skin is thinnest."" I think they might be referring to the place where the veil between Azeroth and the Twisting Nether is weakest - the Tomb of Sargeras.   With our forces having established a foothold at the Broken Shore, this would be an opportune time for Raest and his cultist allies to reach the tomb. I would suggest you stop them."
6657,"The Ranger Lord : Good to see you survived the wreck. Nathanos made it as well, though his face is now even uglier than before.He took a group of rangers north to look for Sylvanas - nobody has seen her since the battle.He asked me to send you his way if you ever woke up."
6658,"Bite of the Sashj'tar : If I had been by Throndyr's side when he fought the naga, he might still be alive.These serpents will regret the day that they decided to slither from their watery hole!Killing them is not enough. No! I will honor Throndyr with a necklace of naga fangs!"
6659,"Take Me To Your Leader : I am glad you are here, <name>.This... Khadgar, the archmage who found my message, has called a meeting.He wishes to meet us at the entrance to the city as soon as possible.Will you accompany me? I have the strangest feeling that he will not be alone."
6660,"Establishing a Connection : <Jace glances at the crystallized soul.>Yes, that will do nicely. Release its energy to activate the communicator - it should already be configured to contact Allari and her forces.If Caria is out there, we will find her, and we will make her suffer for her transgressions."
6661,"Telemetry Online : When Titanstrike's power was expended in Silithus, Hati's essence managed to sever itself from the Thunderspark just in time to avoid destruction.  The only problem is that his essence was then scattered across Azeroth, and we don't know where.  Now that we've locked onto his energy signature, we should be able to triangulate Hati's position!"
6662,
6663,Wisp in the Willows : Wisps are the spirits of our night elven brethren who have become one with the forest. But their minds and the way they perceive things are very different than in life.You should bond with this little one. See through its eyes as it travels to the hidden pools and grows some trees.
6664,"Only the Finest : Say, you're a pretty good hunter, eh? Maybe you could help these tauren out by stocking them with some rare furs. I'm sure they'd appreciate it when they got back!  I hear that Stormheim goat hair can be woven into all kinds of things. The rarest are from the silver-tail goats. I think I saw some in that mountain over there.  Why don't you go and fetch some? I'm sure them tauren would pay you handsomely!"
6665,"A Better Future : We must move quickly, <name>. I must save as many of my people as I can before the attack begins.Word has gotten out in the city that there is a safe haven with us and some no longer fear exile.Venture into the Grand Promenade, champion. Find those willing to join us and let them know it is time they made their escape."
6666,"Heralds of Apocalypse : We've been presented with a rare opportunity.  Our scouts have spotted two shivarra priestesses in the western fel pools enhancing the Legion's war effort.  The inner circle of Sargeras' chosen never leave the walls of Antorus. If we take them out, we might be able to sow fear among those closest to the Dark Titan."
6667,"Masters of Disguise : <You scan over Knockwhistle's report.>""My chute caught a piece of shrapnel. Made a rough landing in a ravenbear nest. Luckily, a bunch of eggs broke my fall.Lost sight of Illandris and Shwayder. Both are masters of disguise, and I am confident they can remain undetected.Will continue to monitor the enemy's activity. Just need to clean all the yolk off my cloaking device. Hope the mother's not around..."
6668,Close Enough : <Oculeth's eyes have dulled. His voice trembles.>  Are we... are we close?  So hungry...
6669,"The Light's Wrath : Light's Wrath... a bold choice. Though if you believe you can control its energies, it could prove vital to our cause.  Retrieving it won't be easy. It was last held by the Kirin Tor, who, fearing its unbridled power, handed it to the blue dragonflight to secure away from the hands of men. Only they would know exactly where it was taken, or how to retrieve it.  The dragon Kalec may be our best chance. He now resides upon the Council of Six in Dalaran. Seek him, and your answers, there."
6670,"A Matter of Finesse : A rune of portals?! Who does Val'zuun think he is?<Valeera takes a deep breath.>It's worth the price, but those runes aren't exactly easy to come by. Unless...Archmage Celindra, the Kirin Tor's portal master, has a study in the center of town. We rogues aren't particularly welcome there, nor would she simply hand a rune over even if we were...<Valeera smirks.>But who said anything about asking?"
6671,
6672,"A Conduit No More : One final task remains to sever the Burning Legion's connection to other worlds.I'll provide you transportation to get you close to the source of power, but you must deliver the final blow to the conduit."
6673,"A Strike at the Heart : These pits have long been a blight upon the lives of our new allies. The demons hunt them down and torture the poor souls for sport.<Turalyon shakes his head with disgust, fixing his gaze upon the beast before him.>It is time to make them pay for their cruelty and restore hope to this Light-forsaken place.We strike on your mark, <name>."
6674,"Continuing the Legend : There are still two paths you may walk - two powerful weapons you might yet obtain to aid you in the fight against the Legion.I will help you recall your remaining options, of course."
6675,"Put It All on Red : All right, I've got one last beasty to send you after. He's a bit far out, but trust me, it'll be worth it. This one I put a huge wager on!  Along the eastern coast swims a great shark the locals call Steelscale. They say his hide is near impenetrable.  But you're gonna prove them wrong, aren't ya chum? Bring me his fin, and those tauren will have to fork over a princely sum."
6676,"An Audience with Torok : I should warn you that Torok is easily displeased and is hateful of outsiders. Be on your guard.  We will seek an audience with him at his tent at the Cliff's Edge. As the Rivermane Emissary here, I am afforded some protection against aggression, but they have made no such promises about you."
6677,
6678,"Out of the Darkness : Alora and I were were able to escape through one of the Legion's portals back to Azeroth but that's about as far as our luck got us.The portal put us on a small isle somewhere to the west of the Broken Shore. They saw us quickly and we made a run for the protection of the water. As I attempted to leap to safety, I was wounded. But Alora... she tripped and I watched them drag her back.Rescue her, please! I'll mark where the camp is on your map, just don't let her go through that ordeal again."
6679,"Parts Unknown : Brambley... I still canna' believe it.I canna' leave the lad here... not in this place... not like this.Help me find the rest of him, so I can take his remains back home where he belongs.We'll give him a proper burial... it's what he deserves!"
6680,"Mouths to Feed : We have rescued many refugees, as you can see. Unfortunately this has revealed a new problem.The arcan'dor fruit is our salvation, but it does not bear enough fruit right now to cure everyone. We must rely on mana a little longer to tide the refugees over.Valtrois thinks that she may have a solution. Please go speak with her and see what she plans to do."
6681,"Where the Wildkin Are : Owlbeasts are often charged with protecting places of importance to Elune. But if her influence over them wanes or is cut off, the creatures can become dangerous.  These wildkin, unfortunately, must be dealt with. The recent disturbances in Val'sharah have driven these creatures to madness.  Once an individual is lost, there is only one way to address the problem.  I cannot bring myself to kill one of Elune's creations, but I know what must be done."
6682,"Tears for Fears : The Tears of Elune are a sacred artifact, protected by my order for thousands of years. I tell you this so that you may understand the gravity of your request.That said, Ysera is noble and wise and I trust in her guidance. You will find the tears in a vault at the eastern edge of the temple grounds.Proceed with caution though, as that area has been overrun by demons."
6683,
6684,"The Third Trial of Ursol : You've proven to me your strength and your courage, but do you possess the ability to apply yourself when it matters most?This final trial will reveal all."
6685,"Shadow of the Triumvirate : Talgath's words carry more gravity than I think he knew. In an attempt to hurt me one final time, he has given us the answer.The Crest of Knowledge is hidden away in the Seat of the Triumvirate, and it is not unguarded.If my suspicions are correct, we may be facing a greater threat than any of us dared imagine.A dark naaru.Let us return to the Vindicaar. We will plan our next steps there."
6686,"Wrath of the High Exarch : Where the Legion is concerned, violence is always the answer.<Turalyon hefts his blade with a grim expression.>They are between us and Velen. Nothing will stop them from finding him unless we act. Now is not the time to hold back.Together we will sow chaos among their ranks."
6687,"Fel Machinations : My force wiped out the demons' forward base here. But, an imp mother and her brood took the rest of my demon hunters hostage, including Cyana Nightglaive.  We need to free the Illidari and destroy the Burning Legion."
6688,"A Desperate Journey : The city's entrances are under heavy guard. He must have another way.Thanks to this wine I am strong enough to make the journey to him. I fear that I will not be able to defend or run if I come under attack.You will accompany me, <race>. You and this Astoril are my only chance at surviving now. I remember when I was leaving the city that there were lamps guiding me here. We should be able to retrace our steps by following them."
6689,"The Three : When High Crawliac seized control of the harpies she placed 3 powerful and deadly witches in charge of the covens under her command.These witches must die. Feel up for the challenge?Head into the Haglands behind me and find these three evil creatures.We will cover you from the air and give your prey no sky to retreat.Look for us higher up the mountain, should you survive."
6690,The Runes that Bind : The stone tablet here describes a ritual where a powerful spirit can be broken into weaker pieces by binding them to special runestones. It looks like the Bonespeakers may be using this very ritual to weaken the spirit of Ashildir.  It may be impossible to summon her with her spirit so weakened. The rituals must be stopped.
6691,"A Walk to Remember : It's good to have you at my side, <name>.  I've come to the Broken Shore to see, for myself, the price that my father... that the Alliance has paid to protect our world.  As long as I am blind to the suffering and sacrifices of my people, I will never be able to lead them to peace.  Time is short, we should move onward."
6692,An Important Mission : Champion! I bear an urgent message from Danath Trollbane.He requests that you join him at Krasus' Landing. He has an urgent mission that requires your expertise!
6693,"Overt Ops : My soldiers are out there, <name>.I need you to find Baraat, Sorvos, and Telaamon. They were in the process of securing this area for Velen when the Legion came down on top of our heads.Inform them that their orders are to regroup with the Prophet at once.The time for subtlety has passed. There is a small army between us and them. Do what you must.Light keep you safe."
6694,"That Guy in the Costume : Aye, when we were out huntin' on the coast, we ran into this ridiculous lad in in a costume. He says he's tryin ta blend in with the murlocs... but I'm pretty sure he's just not right in the head.  One of ours stayed behind to keep an eye on him when we headed back to camp... mind checkin' it out?  Ye can ask Tamara over there for a ride."
6695,"Odyn and the Valarjar : Fear not, mortal, you are not dead. I was directed to collect you before your demise by Odyn himself.  I will take you to Odyn now, follow me."
6696,"Close Enough to Touch : He is near, <name>, I can feel it.We must scour this place in search of my husband. I fear if we do not find him soon it will be too late.You have been courageous throughout our search. I know you will not fail me now, <name>.Thank you, and please hurry."
6697,"A Pact of Necessity : We have an unexpected ally in this war, <name>, and we're going to need every advantage we can get to defeat the Burning Legion.The Ebon Blade will serve as the Lich King's arm as long as the Scourge is confined to Northrend. In return for our assistance, our ally has offered to assist in obtaining powerful weapons for the strongest of our knights. Weapons powerful enough to end the Legion once and for all!You are one of our best, <name>. I want you to decide which weapon you would like to seek out."
6698,Fragments of Disaster : In the hall beyond rests the bones of the failed arcan'dor.  I will take fragments of the crystallized tree and attempt to read them. We must discover the root cause of this destruction.  Only then do we have any hope of preventing this disaster from repeating itself.
6699,
6700,
6701,"Rigging the Wager : Care to help settle a bet, chum?  Those tauren are Skyhorn, and they fancy themselves big-time hunters. I bet them a pretty penny that they wouldn't be able to take out some of the biggest beasts in Stormheim.  If you take em out before they do, I'll split the wager. Deal?  The first is a big eagle nesting in the foothills. They call him Spitefeather. You can bait him with some meat, but he's up pretty high, so you'll need a grapple gun to get there. I think there's one of them layin around here..."
6702,
6703,"The Dreamway : The preparations for the ritual are now complete.Come with me, <name>, I will guide you to the ceremony."
6704,"Whispering Felflame Crystal : The crystal pulses with an eerie, felfire green glow. Holding it, you hear faint echoes of guttural demonic voices. Although the words are jumbled, one is both decipherable and repeated often: Dalaran.   Perhaps someone in the city floating over the Broken Isles can tell you more about this crystal and its purpose."
6705,"Zealot's Dues : Commander Domitille represents the very essence of the Nightborne's corruption. Abhorrent of power not their own, enamoured with their Grand Magistrix to the point of zealotry, and focused utterly on the destruction of the Moon Guard.  Take her helm to Lothrius as proof of her demise."
6706,"Paid in Lifeblood : We have fulfilled Helya's bargain. Now, we see if she will keep to her word.  When you are ready, we should proceed to the throne. If you have any other business here, I would suggest finishing it now.  I will follow your lead, outsider."
6707,"One More Thing... : Well done, Slayer. You are truly now the leader of the Illidari. But there's one more thing.  Meet me down at the forge."
6708,"Hit the Books : <The librarian speaks in shushed tones.>One problem with maintaining such a large arcane library is that the books often pick up an errant enchantment and start darting about on their own. These overmagicked books need to be destroyed before they cause any further damage.If you encounter any of these exasperating essays, please put them down. Quietly."
6709,
6710,"Strike Back : As you may have seen, the ritualists in this forest kidnap our people and perform heinous rituals on them. The souls of our fallen now roam as twisted creatures. This sin cannot go unpunished. Kill as many ritualists as you are able, but be sure to strike at the dark demon that leads them."
6711,A Greater Arsenal : The tome speaks of one more weapon that friend can use against our foes.   Do you wish to seek it?
6712,"They Came From the Sea : You're looking for Prince Farondis?<The ghostly elf narrows her eyes warily.>I can take you to Farondis... but first things first. These naga attacked suddenly. They take orders from one called Zarrin, in the low hills to the west.Help me take Zarrin's head, and you'll have my ear."
6713,"Dressing With Class : Now stop right there. Look at you! You look like you just walked in off of the street. Where are your robes and hat?And don't tell me you've entered the academy without your wand and spellbook.Freshmen.Put yourself together, and maybe then I will consider letting you enter the academy."
6714,"Unbridled Power : Although our forces have dutifully held this citadel since your departure, we have been unable to access most of its resources - the Fel Hammer can only be fully activated by those bearing the mark of a Legion lord.Thankfully, your blades carry that very mark. Use them to activate the Fel Hammer - show your forces your limitless power!"
6715,"Shatter the Sashj'tar : The Sashj'tar forces may have dwindled, but the Tidemistress has surrounded herself with her fiercest naga.This is the time to strike a final crushing blow against the Sashj'tar.If we can defeat them now, we may finally break the back of this menace and save Jandvik."
6716,"The Gates Are Closed : Sigryn must be reached before she can confront Odyn, but our path is blocked. Odyn will close the Gates of Valor as soon as he becomes aware of Sigryn's assault. You will have to find another way into the Halls.  I have no talent with portals, but your friends at the Kirin Tor seem to be very adept. Go now to them, and find a way through.  I thank you for what you've done to help Sigryn this far, <class>. I only hope we can save her from herself."
6717,"Securing the Way : I was able to make contact with our forces on Mardum - they secured the Fel Hammer after our departure all those years ago and have held it ever since!Malevolence has utilized the ship's warp systems to transport the bulk of our forces aboard, but doing so greatly taxes what little power remains.I believe there to be a better way.Your glaives carry a piece of the power of Kil'jaeden - you should be able to use them to open a permanent gateway to the Fel Hammer."
6718,"The Fate of Deadwind : The journal mentions a ""stronger pull"" for the compass. If the spirits of this place are indeed tied to it, they may serve as the pull we need.  I've come upon several locations in the pass where restless spirits tend to appear. Perhaps if you show the spirits there the compass, they may be able to help point it in the right direction.  You seek these locations out. I'll continue on to Karazhan and see if I can find anything leading to the Dark Riders."
6719,"Assault on Violet Hold: Purple Pain : Again! It happened again!  Sure, it's the Legion that staged the prison breakout this time, but I *told* them it was a bad idea to keep some of the most dangerous beings on Azeroth in a prison inside our city!  We can talk about relocating later, I suppose. Right now, we've got some... pacification to tend to.  Can you help?"
6720,"Ask and You Shall Receive : A Legion communicator? Hmmmm.<Khadgar pauses to think for a moment.>You know what, I think I have something in my lockbox upstairs that is just the ticket."
6721,"Resisting Arrest : Your findings do not disappoint, <name>.  Make your way to the soul engine and use our newly acquired weapons to dismantle the power source."
6722,"Unbeleyvable : Back to the task at hand!Take these ley line taps. We can use the resonant energies to properly redirect the flow, but they must be placed in precise locations. I will show you where.Your friend has agreed to... ""supervise"" us. Let us hope she just stays out of the way while the professionals take care of this."
6723,"To See the Past : I would like for you to experience firsthand what Huln Highmountain was able to accomplish in a single battle during the War of the Ancients.  To do so, I will need very specific ingredients. They are not too difficult to obtain--you can find all of them near Thunder Totem."
6724,"Boss Whalebelly's in Charge : Great, let's get started! If we're going to break everyone out of here, you need to pose as a pit fighter like the rest of us. They won't just let you run around anywhere you want in here.  First thing you need to do is present yourself to Boss Whalebelly. The giants may run this place, but as far as posing as one of us, Whalebelly's in charge.  He's speaking with his goons just to the south."
6725,"A Desperate Plea : <name>, Saurfang has not been the same since our loss at the Broken Shore. Though he led well and slew many, he has taken our defeat hard.I fear he is determined to return to the Broken Shore. Will you speak to him?"
6726,"A Grapple a Day : So these trials are what will get us the Aegis, and the next one is on the top of that mountain? That may prove problematic.  The only way I see up the mountain is through that vrykul city, and the gates are shut tight. We should be able to grapple over, though. If you don't have a launcher, I managed to wrangle a spare from one of these vrykul.  I'll scout ahead and see if I can find a good spot to get in."
6727,Back from the Dead : <Olothil sighs.>My sister tries my patience sometimes.No matter. I've identified a few locations that our parents might be. I shall search in this area with Kallistia. You've already helped us so much... would you help us look to the east?You can use my scrying orb to see the locations that our ritual has uncovered.
6728,"Nar'thalas Still Suffers : They have not forgiven me. I cannot blame them.Past crimes aside, I am still their prince. Even in death, I will do what I can to protect my people.<name>. Act as my champion. Find and defeat the creature that leads this naga attack against the people of Nar'thalas. After all these years, you - |5<race> <class>, of all things - may be the instrument of my redemption."
6729,"The Demon's Trail : Malfurion is nearby. I can sense him..Search the summit of Andu'talah while I continue to scour the forest.Be swift, <name>. Time is of the essence!"
6730,"Sanctum of Order Teleporter Online! : <The telemancy beacon is deactivated, but intact. Some Ancient Mana should get it back up and running.>"
6731,
6732,"Lay Waste, Lay Mines : They ransacked my library, <name>.  If they want our knowledge, we will give it to them.   This piece of rune work will allow you to cast an ensnaring spell on the ground. When the Nightborne cross the threshold they will see the true might of the Moon Guard.  Teach them well!"
6733,"Return of the Light : Excellent!There is a gateway further down this pathway and like most Legion constructs it is powered by souls.I think the death of that Inquisitor should be just enough to activate it and open the way back to where it came from.Let's go see where the path takes us, shall we?"
6734,"Clutch Play : I confess the stone drake broodmother and I have had a rocky relationship in the past. She supported Deathwing during the Cataclysm, you know. But Aeosera has been put back in her place and it is my responsibility to protect her.The problem is that she refuses to abandon her eggs, even in the midst of a trogg attack.You're a shaman! Use your natural magnetism to reassemble fallen Opalescent Guardians in the Pale Roost. Escort them to Aeosera so they can carry her eggs to safety of my bosom."
6735,"Void Inoculation : All entities touched by shadow leave behind traces of void when they are defeated, If you collect enough in your travels through the city, return to me, and I will distill it into its undiluted form.   We can save more of my kin."
6736,
6737,"A Foe of the Dark : I cannot believe the Dark Riders found us here. Long have they hunted the scythe to sate their lust for the artifacts of Azeroth. We thought we would be protected within the grove...  And now, Valorn is gone...  You must become the hunter, <name>. Seek the Dark Riders and recover the scythe. We last encountered them near Manor Mistmantle in Duskwood. Start your search there.  And <name>... bring justice to Valorn. The rider must pay."
6738,"Dire News : Azeroth was right in sendin' us here, <name>. We have to stop whatever it is Sargeras is plannin', or we may not have a home left to save when this is all over.Ye should go back to Turalyon and let him know what ye've seen. I'll stay here and see if I can't glean anything else that might help us."
6739,"Following the Curse : In my previous confrontation with your foe, I was able to see a glimpse into their past. Granted blessed vision by the Cloak of Purity, I saw the Dark Riders for who they once were.  Come, we must go to Ariden's Camp in Deadwind Pass. I can explain its significance along the way."
6740,"To Weather the Storm : I've been doing some nosing around, and it looks like these vrykul are making regular trips up the mountain themselves. They've got some specialized gear for it, so while we're here we should take some.  I'd recommend finding some climbing treads to keep your grip on the slopes, as well as an oiled cloak to keep the rain out. Also, it looks like they carry enchanted lodestones, which seem to keep the lightning at bay. You should probably grab one of those, too."
6741,"Their Dying Breaths : I have precious little time. As we speak, my troops are defending against an onslaught of withered elves.These four whelplings are near death. Their lives are of the utmost importance to our flight, as they may be some of the last whelplings Senegos can rear.Some cracked ley crystals should bring them back to their senses."
6742,"The Storm's Fury : No longer do we have time to prepare, the moment of action is upon us!  Come with me, little one. With you guiding my aim we shall cleanse this isle by thunder and lightning!"
6743,Confirming Suspicions : That heart is the last remaining piece of Highlord Kruul - once one of the Legion's best warlords.Many years ago Kruul's armies nearly descended upon the Dark Portal to crush the Azerothian assault on Outland. We Illidari intercepted before he could strike.I fear that the Legion aims to use the heart to hasten Kruul's resurrection in the nether. We must find the Prophet Velen at once - only he can tell us for sure.
6744,"Balance of Elements : The drogbar place their foul crystals in our cave to absorb the magic within, and then they collect them when they are saturated with power.  We must recover the crystals so the magic might dissipate and be suffused back into the waters, or else the drogbar will find ways to corrupt the magic to their own purposes."
6745,"Apex Predator : I have good news and bad news, <race>.The bad news is that they somehow managed to capture and train a Devilsaur.The good news is that it doesn't seem to have a collar and is tame. I imagine it must think that one of the Nightborne in there is its master. Find the pack leader and take him out, and we will set quite a beast upon them."
6746,"Finishing the Job : Garona set out to assassinate the leaders of a Legion cult some time ago. We haven't heard from her since.To make matters worse, she took the Kingslayers with her. She knows they bring out the worst in her!Your best bet to find Garona is by continuing her work. Our intel points to a warlock by the name of Caden Shadowgaze inducting new recruits at the Altar of Storms in Blasted Lands. See if he has anything useful in his pockets.Once he's dead, I mean."
6747,"Not-So-Humble Beginnings : Now we may begin our search for the Crown of the Triumvirate. We will start with the fragment Archimonde carried: the Sigil of Awakening.To the east and north you will find all that remains of the greatest school of magic on Argus. It was there that Archimonde gained his mastery of the arcane. I can think of no other place he would stow his treasures.It will be guarded, no doubt. We will leverage the expertise of Fareeya's forces here to follow this trail."
6748,"I'll Huff, I'll Puff... : Murky is my favorite little fella. However, in order to lead a change in the murloc population here, he needs some awesome abilities.  There are a lot of pufferfish around in the water, and I think that they could be a good resource for him.   Kill a few and collect their eggs for Murky."
6749,"The Final Blessing : My friend Solendra Featherdown went to explore the habitat of the native Nightsabers.   Now that we have the blessings of the Feathermane and the Sablehorn it is time to seek the blessing of the Nightsabers. She is just on the other side of this glade, to the North."
6750,"Enhancement: Fate of the Tideskorn : A scout from Stormheim arrived yesterday with a significant discovery - these ancient scrolls. Within they contain a Valkyra prophecy of a new vrykul ruler - one who could turn the Tideskorn against the Legion.  It complicates matters that this vrykul may in fact be Skovald's heir.  Take the scrolls, find the heir, and bring her to the Valkyra. I think the outcasts they refer to are the vrykul of Jandvik, so that would be a good place to start.  |cFF660000Specialization: Enhancement Shaman|r"
6751,Grotesque Remains : These grotesque remains are an amalgamation of jelly-like ooze and what appear to be dryad bones.  Guviena Bladesong would be interested in seeing these.
6752,"Out of the Dream : Malfurion Stormrage... A name I have not heard in centuries.He was teacher to many of us. If he seeks my audience, I cannot refuse.I will go to the Grove of Cenarius, but first, we must awaken the rest of my clan. They slumber with no way of waking.A mysterious force of great power is at work against us.I am still too weak from my hibernation. Please, stranger, go and free them from their dreams."
6753,"Take the Edge Off : The demons streaming out of Antorus equip themselves at Felfire Armory. We need to deny those weapons. Will your <class>s fight alongside the Army of the Light once again?  Before the assault, gather materials. My smiths will craft your soldiers more powerful armor. The Legion won't give up Felfire without a fight."
6754,"Expanding Your Horizons : You are a fast study, <class>t <name>. The elements speak through you - it is rare to have such a connection to the world.A true shaman must walk many paths. For every role, one must have the right tools at hand. Only the most powerful weapons can lead us to victory against the Legion. Perhaps it is time to seek out another?Speak with me and let us discuss your options."
6755,"A Rather Long Walk : I'm concerned for Elder Aldryth. He went out for a walk about ten thousand years ago, and he has not returned.With these naga attacking, I fear he may be in danger!If you dare venture out into the fray, do look out for our court elder."
6756,"The Final Ingredient : The potion is complete, <name>. Soon our journey will be over. There is one last thing I would have you do for me, then you shall have your reward.My wife's bow was kept here, but I have not been able to find it after searching everywhere. There is potent magic in it.I fear one of the restless spirits may have taken it, but it would take a powerful force to pick up an item such as this. Be careful."
6757,"Pins and Needles : Hngghh!Nope, can't stand yet. It's all pins and needles.Small fries like this are usually no problem for the 7th, but we weren't prepared for their electrical attacks. Before I knew it, I was trapped in some kind of static field. Couldn't move a muscle until you came along.My comrades were carried deeper into the cave. Get 'em out before they become whelp chow!"
6758,"The Corruptor : Xandris has been slain, but there are others that must be dealt with if my grove is to be saved.During the great war, Kagraxxis took great pleasure in corrupting the lands he once called home.Were it not for the foolish mercy of my fellow druids, I would have slain him myself.Find the demon and bring justice upon him.I must entrust this task to you alone, for I sense an even darker presence here... one that requires my personal attention."
6759,"Arkhaan's Peril : Whatever called to him, it cannot have good intentions. We need to go in after him.Before we step through this portal, <name>... ensure you are prepared to fight. The Void's influence is rarely peaceful."
6760,"In Defiance of Deathwing : It was in this place, ages ago, that Huln Highmountain challenged the great Deathwing.Today we shall re-live moments of that day through the eyes of our ancestors.For this next part of the spirit journey, we must seek out the three braziers set down many ages ago so that those who would follow in the footsteps of Huln might witness his deeds."
6761,"Insurrection: As Strong As Our Will : In the wake of Elisande's attack, the need is stronger than ever to add to the ranks of the Nightfallen rebellion.Plans are in motion that may help with this in an unconventional way.Report to First Arcanist Thalyssra in Shal'Aran for more details."
6762,"A Walk With the Spirits : The spiritwalker you saved from Riverbend has been insufferable since his arrival. He is insisting on showing you the ways of our people so that you better understand what is to come.He is a strange one, even by spiritwalker standards.Even so, only a fool would discard his insight. Please, go to speak with him when you get a moment."
6763,"Preventive Measures : There is no end to the Legion's depravity. Every battle won, every world conquered, yields more souls to fuel their war machine.  They have not yet defiled all of the fallen warriors in the hold, but I fear it is only a matter of time. Please, take this talisman with you into the hold and use it to sanctify any corpses you encounter.  They deserve a better fate."
6764,"A Threat Rises : It is time I told you another tale. While you listen, would you be so kind as to pour me some grog? I've grown a terrible thirst.  The keg is very old and the tap is a bit slow."
6765,"Reconvene : You found Lyessa in the Dream, didn't you, Shan'do <name>? I heard you mutter her name in your slumber.Thank Elune she is well.You must seek her out - I can sense her presence even now at the Circle of Spirits above.If ever there were one who could help us cleanse G'Hanir, it is Lyessa."
6766,"Titanic Showdown : The tale of Huln did not end with him acquiring the Hammer of Khaz'goroth.No. For that part, we must venture deeper into this cavern. A final brazier awaits us ahead.Come, let us see what happened next."
6767,The Story of Huln : You work to unite the tribes. That is no small task. It has only been done once before in the history of this mountain.  Huln Highmountain last united the tribes thousands of years ago to take on the Legion during the War of the Ancients.
6768,"Lightforged Beacon: City Center : Hail, friend!Captain Fareeya sent us ahead to secure this area. We were just about to call down a beacon and report back to the Vindicaar.We would be honored if you would help us complete our mission.The signal beacon just needs a light touch. The Grand Artificer will do the rest."
6769,"Huln's War - Shadowsong : Someone with whom I believe you are familiar commands in the battlefield below.  Jarod Shadowsong speaks highly of you, and has requested that you join him in battle.  He has plans to put an end to this fight."
6770,"The Warden's Signet : The night elf was carrying a signet engraved with the crest of the Wardens.The band, made from a silvery, unbreakable metal, has been worn down by time, as if absently twisted and rubbed against its owner's finger."
6771,"Alodi's Gems : Arrexis had a cadre of apprentices and subordinates to help him with the ritual, something you are currently lacking.In older times, when magic was less understood and spells required vast amounts of mana to cast, we stored mana in gems for use in complex spells.Lucky for us, I still have a few powerful Mana Gems in my vault, along with some other useful items. You merely need to go to the Bank of Dalaran and gain access."
6772,"Beneath Oronaar : The krokul we found beneath Oranaar did not wish to leave. Could you speak with him, <name>? Convince him to board the Vindicaar."
6773,
6774,"Symbols of Power : This demon has information that could lead us to those in charge.Unfortunately, he is more fearful of his master than he is of us. We need to change his mind about that.The most powerful Burning Legion soldiers often carry an emblem of their rank and status within the demon army.Seek out the stronger demons in Felsoul Hold, slay them, and return to me with their emblems.We will show this wyrmtongue servant who it is he should fear..."
6775,
6776,"An Artisan's Mark : You there! Do you have a moment?I need you to meet with my friend in the Promenade and retrieve a signet ring. I would send my oaf of an apprentice, but he is not finished with the simple task I gave him.I am expecting a guest at any moment and I simply must have it before he arrives. Can you help me, friend?"
6777,"Dark Side of the Moon : Xavius has been this way, but his destination is unclear. The Nightmare smothers my mind!  These refugees tell of an ancient Moonwell hidden in the ruins ahead.  If it is uncorrupted, it will give me the focus I need. By Elune's light, we will find my husband yet.  Meet me at the Moonwell at once, <class>."
6778,"A Second Weapon : We have strong leads on other ancient weapons that you might choose to pursue, if having one renowned, powerful piece of history in your hands is somehow insufficient.  I'll lay out the options for you. Let me know how you'd like to proceed."
6779,"The Hammer in the Deep : <Thrall listens intently.>You found it! The Doomhammer fell to the Crumbling Depths... But the Legion remains a step ahead of us. If we hurry, we can follow the demon Geth'xun and retrieve the hammer before any more of this realm is corrupted.Therazane will open a portal directly there. Let's go!"
6780,
6781,
6782,
6783,"Down to Business : First things first, <name>: we must set up our camp.We do not have the time or resources for a prolonged siege. It is not like we can starve them out. No, we must be swift and sure as an arrow, piercing their heart in one strike.They are drawing up their battle lines within the city, but could attack us while we are setting up our defenses.Venture forth and show them what the kaldorei have learned from thousands of years of war. Discover their weaknesses so that we may exploit them."
6784,"Vengeance for Margaux : <Sylverin sputters, pale-faced with rage.>  How could they? Margaux did everything they asked of her and more! The arcwine never stopped flowing despite everything they did to us! To her!  Such injustice cannot stand. We must take vengeance for Margaux."
6785,"Ormgul the Pestilent : We've lived at peace with the drogbar for years--our tribe even more than the others. But we were betrayed in our last trade with them at Riverbend.  They usually supply us with potent alchemy to prevent insects from infesting our fields. This time, led by Ormgul, they have attacked the crops that sustain us all.  Ormgul the Pestilent is the one who brought the infection to our farmland. Destroy him, and bring me whatever he uses to attract the bugs to our land."
6786,Rain Death Upon Them : Aboard the hippogryph you now possess a unique opportunity. It is time for the Nightborne to regret letting you live.
6787,"Missing Persons : Our new friend brings us some disturbing information.She claims to have seen a large number of citizens dragged from Starcaller Retreat in chains. Their destination appears to be Astravar Harbor.Those taken to the harbor have yet to return, however. Worse yet, the area is now overrun with demons.I need you to find out where these people went. Infiltrate the harbor and gather any information you can.Start with the Legion filth- their corpses may point us in the right direction."
6788,"Fury of the Storm : The Felskorn who ravage my brood were once Drekirjar - a tribe with whom we shared an ancient pact. Now, under the influence of the God-King, they forsake their oaths and strike at the forebears of their coveted drakes.  They should answer for this slight.  Awaken your fury, <class>, and take the battle to them!"
6789,"A Titanic Effort : The reaction's intensity is accelerating by the day. We may win the fight against the Legion only to lose something very dear to us.  Is this a portent of some greater upheaval to come? What fate awaits our world, <name>?  I will seek answers at my forge, as I have done all my life. Your answers, I suspect, lie elsewhere."
6790,"Rocs vs Eagles : High Crawliac has taught her witches how to curse our beloved eagles into the vile rocs you see assaulting the valley.There is no way to break this curse once it has taken hold.We will take to the skies and do battle with the rocs, but we need your help on the ground.Head north through Darkfeather Valley and release any eagles that you find.Every eagle you save is one less roc we must kill later."
6791,"A Different Source : I need you to fetch me something.I think I might be on the verge of a breakthrough of a new source of magic, but I require tools. I can no longer access my workshop, but I have seen the smaller demons below using tools. Bring me one of their tools and I can save our people."
6792,
6793,"Moon Reaver : We must not delay! If Keeper Remulos is in danger, he must be protected.  With the dreamcatcher, we should be able to enter the lair of the owlbeast Boneflux.  It must be defeated so Keeper Remulos can break free!"
6794,"Break the Spine : To lead his tainted forces,  the God-King has enlisted demons of great power to act as his lieutenants. If we wish to end his assault, we will need to take their leaders.  These demons are too powerful for most mortals to face, but with the power of Stormheim at your disposal, they will prove no match for you.   Take them down, and shatter the spine of Skovald's offensive!"
6795,
6796,"Asking a Favor : Caria Felsoul was one of our best... before she answered the Legion's foul call.She now wields the Aldrachi Warblades - the soul-rending armaments of the ancient race's greatest champion, who fell only to Sargeras himself.We sent a party to track Caria down, but we have not heard from them in some time. Jace has nearly repaired a Legion communicator so we can make contact - we need only a power source.Could you ask Khadgar for assistance? Our friends in this world are few."
6797,"Into The Heavens : This stone is saturated with elemental power, possibly the remnant of the magic used against Irmaat!If you went outside and held the stone aloft, it should unleash the stone's essence as a mighty whirlwind. So potent a windstorm could carry you and your companion all the way to Skywall!If the hand blades of Irmaat, the Fists of the Heavens, are as powerful as the old tales say, they would certainly be found there."
6798,"Prisoners No More : Hatuun's people have endured arduous times. Their numbers dwindle as those ripped from beyond the walls of their sanctuary become servants to the annihilan lords in the pits just beyond, sentenced to a life of labor, torture and ultimately, death.  Seek out these captives, release them from their bonds and show our allies we stand as one against the Burning Legion."

6802,"Demon Detainment : The demons that escaped must be detained. Killing them is not an option. Uriah was entrusted to deliver the prisoners to Allari for interrogation, and I will not let him fail.  I've seen Uriah trap many demons. It seems... complicated, but I think I can pull it off. I'll just need you to subdue them first."

But there is much you must learn of what awaits you on the horizon.  The power of Death is on the rise. The veil weakens between your world and the Shadowlands.  When a mortal life expires, an echo of it remains behind. The most powerful mortals leave the most resonant echoes.  Bring these to me, that I might study them... to both our benefits."

Still, what matters most is my people are safe now.  The fleet and marines should be here soon to help the Outriggers clear out what remains of the Horde forces. Please return to High Commander Wyrmbane and let him know I will join everyone as soon as I am able.  Thank you for your swift actions today, <name>."

I caught wind of an Alliance operation into some old vault that opened in Tiragarde Sound.  In typical gnomish fashion, Tinkmaster Overspark is overreacting like crazy, claiming it's some lost connection to the gnome fairytale land of Mechagon.  <Gazlowe scoffs.>  I don't buy that for a second, but I am very interested in getting my hands on whatever tech's in that vault.

For us gnomes, that means fully mechanical. For dwarves and troggs, stone. Vrykul, iron.  The list goes on, but most races aren't even ON the list.

6836,"Aiding the Wharf : We have read the tides, and never before have I seen them in such turmoil. They call to the tidesages, begging for help.A debilitating sickness is running rampant amongst the villagers, and it comes from the sea.We are but few. There is only so much we can do!Please, take this list and gather the listed reagents from around the pier while I attempt to calm these folks.

It appears that Vorus'arak did not want to shed his shell, and instead wore the same scarred carapace for a very long time.  All across the carapace, strange markings have been carved. It seems to be a language of some kind.>"
6839,"Our War Continues : The work to stop the Alliance is far from over, <name>. But thanks to you, we have the methods necessary to break them.  The Abyssal Scepter has been delivered to King Rastakhan, earning us more of his favor.  There is a matter of greater importance that I would speak to you about... but not here.  Meet me aboard the Banshee's Wail within Zuldazar."
6840,"Defeat Jakra'zet : Jakra'zet is summoning Mythrax the Unraveler!  We cannot allow the ritual to continue. Jakra'zet must be stopped before it's too late!  Lead the way, <name>. We'll be right behind you.  Let's go!"
6841,"Tol Dagor: The Fourth Key : Hey, wait a second. I know the type of key our fourth lock needs. This is the same sort of lock the Ashvane company uses. Resists lockpicks like nothing else, but they have a standard skeleton key. There was a set hanging on the wall in the Tol Dagor Armory. Given the state we left it in, it'd be easy to grab it.  Taelia and I will take the chest back to the Harbormaster's office for safe keeping.   You go in to Tol Dagor and get that last key!"
6842,"Mischief Managed : Thank you for returning this artifact to us, <name>. Now that we have the Abyssal Scepter, the fleet can advance without fear of the seas being turned against us.  Please report our success to High Commander Wyrmbane."
6843,"Beginning the Descent : Protecting one's mind against the old gods requires an object of pure corruption. Unbeknownst to many, one such object exists--dormant beneath the molten pits of Blackwing Descent.  Until recently, one of my agents stood watch over the area, keeping detailed records of suspicious activities. Unfortunately, this agent has gone silent. It is now clear we are not the only ones with this knowledge.  If we are to find answers, there is one place to look.  Our journey continues, <name>. Blackrock awaits."
6844,"Target: Blood Prince Dreven : We must kill Blood Prince Dreven and his followers. I know of the place where they intend to go. Here is the plan.  You and Keeshan will make your way to the tunnels and act as bait, lure Dreven into a false sense of security.  Myself and the sentinels will seal the entrance to trap him and his allies shortly thereafter.  Then we kill them all. I'll send word to the others to get moving.  Let's go."
6845,"A Question of Quillpower : I can't believe you managed to kill that thing. You're quite impressive, you know that?Either way, we should be getting back to Roz with our report. We're stuck in the middle of the kraul, surrounded by angry quilboar. But I have a plan!Some of the boars seem reasonable enough. I gave them a bit of my rations and they've been following me around. I bet we can use them to hitch a ride out of this place. You in?"
6846,"Having a Blast : We're going to really hit 'em where it hurts, $p.  They're carting tons of black powder right out of that mine. This could end very badly for all of us if we don't do something.  The mines are relatively undefended, I bet you can get in and wipe out their workers before they realize what's happening.  Keep an eye out for some explosives, if we can use their own tools against them, even better!"
6847,"Knowledge of the Past : An old friend of mine came to de sands willingly to gain knowledge of de past.   If anyone can locate dis weapon, it would be Julwaba.   Last I heard, she planned to excavate de ruins surrounding de great pyramid."

The mission will succeed, of this there is no question, but to ensure that any obstacles I encounter are dealt with swiftly I once again have need of your particular skills.

6850,"The Sleeper Agent : Your work here is done, $p. Morton and Megs can take it from here.   Head back to Boralus and let Halford know we've secured the weapon.   Don't you worry one wink about Grong. Morton and Megs will make sure he's well looked after."

I'll need you on the front lines to aid them, <class>. Go with Taelia to the docks and engage the enemy.   With a little luck, we may just make it out of this alive."
6855,"Surfacing Threats : The tol'vir take the protection of the titans' constructs here in Uldum as a sacred duty. However, our numbers have dwindled, and we face greater threats with each day.  Even with the strength of our new allies, we will only be able to hold these enemies back for so long.  Should any of them surge in power, they may still be able to overwhelm us and endanger the forge. This is where your assistance is needed.  Speak to High Commander Kamses to assess our current situation."
6856,"Clearing the Fog : Did you lead Kaja here? I told her not to come after me. It isn't safe...  My mind remains fogged, but de memories are slowly returning. Jakra'zet... de weapon...  Come, let us find some fresh air. I will tell you what I've discovered."

Intelligence shows that he's the highest ranking member of the Reliquary, an elite blood elf excavation force.  He's just standing out in the middle of the desert in Vol'dun, practically begging to be assassinated. Shall we?"
6864,"Ride of the Zandalari : It is time de Alliance see de full fury of de Zandalari. Dey are fools to try an attack in Nazmir.  We must tell de fleet, our warriors, and our flyers dat dey must move out and go to Nazmir at once.  I will go aid our forces at de Blood Gate.

6868,Assault: The Black Empire : I cannot believe my eyes. The Black Empire is materializing right here in the Vale!  We must spring to action!
6869,"The Halls of Origination : It looks like the Halls of Origination have been claimed by a group o' tol'vir calling themselves the Amathet. I don't know much about them other than they're new in town and not the friendliest of types.  We'll need tae get in there and re-activate the forge, or else Azeroth will be done for!"
6870,"An Unwelcome Advisor : <The envelope contains a message from King Anduin Wrynn.>  <name>,  Even with the forces of the Horde and Alliance working together, we still have found no trace of N'Zoth's forces. Ever since his release, the Old God has evaded us at every turn.  The Light only knows what ill he has in store for Azeroth.  Meet me in Stormwind Keep. We must put a plan together to uncover N'Zoth's schemes before it is too late!  Light grant you haste, King Anduin Wrynn"
6871,"Return to Boralus : You know, a lot has happened since you arrived in Zuldazar! I'm sure Mr. Wyrmbane would appreciate a report.  Oh, not from me. Maybe somebody a bit more serious... like you!  I bet Daria over here could get you back pretty quick!"
6872,"Cogfrenzy's Construction Frenzy : You Rustbolt resisters inspire me. Tinkering, building, exploring.  Letting your imagination run wild and then chasing after it, wherever it leads, with reckless abandon!  <Walton releases a deep sigh.>  I miss those days. I hope, someday, my conscience will allow me to stay on the surface with you all permanently...  Before I return to Mechagon, we must build something incredible.  Waren and I have identified a large number of extra construction project sites for today.   Build with boldness!"

6874,"The Engine of Nalak'sha : Your kind have proved me wrong in the past, so I will give you a chance to do so again.  The titan structure which houses the Engine of Nalak'sha spans the entirety of Pandaria. There are more ways to reach it than just the Mogu'shan Vaults.  There are many such routes, but the closest would be through Mogu'shan Palace. The chambers beneath the palace are interconnected with the vaults.   Seek your fate there, champion."
6875,"Shrine of the Storm: The Missing Ritual : The ritual which allows safe passage to Fate's End is a closely guarded secret to keep the curious from venturing there and suffering the same fate as the condemned. I have never conducted it before, but there is a scroll with instructions.  It is held in the Shrine of the Storms. To access the scroll, use the staff you have empowered to break the dark energy surrounding it.  Collect the Ritual of Safe Passage and bring it to me."
6876,"Finding the Rajani : Now that we have an idea of who we're looking for, the next question is, where can we find them?  With the constant infighting of the mogu, it is likely that each clan would keep tabs on the whereabouts of their competitors. If we can find such information, it may just lead us to the Rajani.  Seek out the champions of the mogu. They would be the most likely to carry reports on their enemies' whereabouts."
6877,"A Tempered Blade : These blades that I wield are newly forged. The time has come to temper them in the blood of my enemies.  I have heard that you are skilled in the ways of battle. I too am proficient in the business of death and I would be honored to fight at your side.  Accompany me, <class>, and together we will spill the blood of our enemies."

6880,"Breaking Kul Tiran Will : Our partnership with the Zandalari will soon be secured. Took a little longer than I expected... but such is the way of things.  Unfortunately, the Alliance seems intent on securing a naval force of their own. That can't be allowed to happen.  We set sail for Tiragarde Sound when you're ready."
6881,"The Laboratory of Mardivas : <Several pages are devoted to notes on an experiment, a hastily written journal entry follows.>At last, my research into the base elements has begun to bear fruit!With careful application of the right base reagents and some arcane power I've managed to combine the essence of the elements in such a way as to create life!Further investigation will be needed to determine what the various mixes of the elements will yield.<The writing ends here.>"
6882,"A Cycle of Hatred : We have raised new champions for the Horde, established footholds on Kul Tiran soil, and stolen one of their precious artifacts.  We hold greater power and sway over our enemies than we have before.  Sylvanas has great plans for our Horde, <name>. I will allow you the pleasure of reporting our victories to her personally."

I look forward to being amused by it later.Zolani can show you a way down dat does not involve falling."
6884,
6885,"In the Shadow of Crimson Wings : It is unlike Alexstrasza to remain out of contact for so long, particularly when the very essences of the dragonflights' power are being made manifest.   While our allies here tend to the injured, we must seek out the Life-Binder at once.  When you are ready, we shall ride to the Vermillion Redoubt together."
6886,"The Keepers' Keys : Serrik mentioned you might have uncovered something of significance at Zul'Ahjin?  We don't have much time, I'm afraid.  What is it you have found?"
6887,"Unlikely Allies : I believe this is one of the Keepers' keys! Only Vorrik would know for sure.   We need to head to the temple at once.   My pterrordax can take us there when you're ready, but we need to hurry."
6888,"The Fall of Emperor Korthek : Korthek finally approaches.  It's been many years since I've faced him in battle. When he first rose to power, I failed my people. I will not falter again.  I am prepared to do what must be done. What I should have done long ago.  We must kill Korthek and take his key to prevent him, Jakra'zet, or anyone else from ever resurrecting Mythrax.  When you are prepared, we will face him together."
6889,"With Prince in Tow : Let's set sail for Zandalar. In case you hadn't noticed, we've been dealing with a bit of Alliance interference while you were gone."
6890,"Right Beneath Their Eyes : We need to get into Darkmaul Citadel, rescue the last survivor, and stop the ogre necromancer behind all of this.  Herbert and Crenna are going to cast a spell to make you look an ogre... and then you're going to take us in as your ""prisoners.""  We do not have the strength to launch a full scale assault, so this will have to do.  Speak with Herbert when you're ready."
6891,"On the Move : Jorak's wounds have healed enough for him to travel.  He has agreed to guide us to de temple.   De sooner we leave, de better. Rakera won't survive in dis desert for long."
6892,"A Stroll Through a Cemetery : Our next stop is in Drustvar.  There, along with some help, we shall identify and extract the body of a Kul Tiran war hero.  With his aid, we will learn much of the Kul Tiran fleet. Enough to break it with ease.  We shall meet you outside Barrowknoll Cemetery.  Do try not to waste time, would you?"
6893,"Collaborative Construction : Construction projects can be found all over the island. You'll be able to build some of 'em yourself, but you're gonna need help with the bigger projects.  Ask around and see what others are already working on, or just head out on your own and find a project you're interested in.  Construction projects move around and even change day-to-day, so keep an eye out for new ones while you're exploring.  If you're ever curious what construction projects are available on a given day, just ask me!"
6894,"Atul'Aman : Jakra'zet and his troops attacked while we were away.   Serrik fought well, but it wasn't enough. The keys are gone, and it's only a matter of time before the barrier is broken.  Your friends have already given chase.   Jakra'zet must not be allowed to resurrect Mythrax the Unraveler. He must be stopped before it's too late!  We don't have much time.   Meet me at Atul'Aman! We must catch up with Kaja and Rakera and stop the ritual!"
6895,"A Clean Escape : Our victory here will echo through the Horde like a warning shot.  Grunts will whisper around the campfire that nowhere is safe from $p and the Alliance.  Soldiers will doubt, even for a moment, the strength of their commanders.  Sylvanas herself will hear the story of what we did here today, and it will infuriate her. The thought of her outraged roar when she hears the news will keep me warm tonight.  Let's return to Boralus and inform the High Commander of the good news."
6896,Stow and Go : <Flynn lifts his collar to hide his face and speaks to you under his breath.>  You see that ship? I know that ship.  Let's just say her captain and I have a little history.  It's a smuggling vessel. Our illegal weapons are on there for sure. I'd bet my coat on it... and I love this coat.  We need to find out where it's going...  How are you in tight spaces?
6897,"Pirates? I Hate Those Guys! : <An old pirate hat. Seems out of place on this island, perhaps Reno Jackson will know what to make of it>"
6898,"The Call for Allies : Greetings, champion! I have been appointed as the Horde's diplomatic ambassador to our allies far and wide.   It is my duty to seek out those of like mind and spirit, and speak to them about joining the Horde.  As a renowned hero of the Horde yourself, your aid would be most appreciated! Come see me at the embassy in Orgrimmar when you are able."
6899,
6900,"Righteous Retribution : Cyrus taught me how to deal with thugs, bullies, and scum like pirates.  When they hit us, we hit back twice as hard.  <Taelia's hand finds the haft of her hammer and grips it tight.>  It's time to hit back."
6901,"Return to Zuldazar : Look at dis place, boss-mon! We got da pirates, a location close to da Kul Tiran capital...  I tink we should be bein' pretty proud of dis one.  We should get goin' back and tell Nathanos about our success. Maybe we can even get him to crack a smile."
6902,"Take the High Road : Let us continue to Arom's Stand.  It will take some time to parse the knowledge of the tome and train more inquisitors for our cause.  If the order's weapons are as effective against the coven as they were against the Drust, we may stand a chance of rescuing my family and restoring this land to its former glory.  I will make my way there on foot. Until we meet again, <class>."

6906,"Gallywix Got Away : I must confess my disappointment that we were not able to bring an end to Gallywix's greedy reign today.  But I blame no one but myself, and will report the same to the High Commander. Your performance was exemplary, just as I expected.  I hope the Alliance will not lose faith in the void elves because of this. We have much to offer.  When you're ready, I will open a final Void portal to take us back to Boralus."
6907,"Searching for Answers : There's a saying Cyrus always said when I was a kid: ""The best face is a friendly one."" It's really helped me get to know the visitors from all over the world that come through Boralus.  Let's ask some of the people in charge around here and see if they know anything about the fleet. Maybe it's just a matter of asking nicely!"
6908,Crippling the Horde : Our scouts report that one of Sylvanas's dark ranger captains is in Nazmir.   The dark rangers are Sylvanas's deadliest fighters and scouts. Killing one of their leaders will cripple Horde operations.  Shandris Feathermoon will be leading the operation in Nazmir. Head there now and strike before we lose this chance.
6909,To Be Forsaken : Let's move. Zelling is probably with his family now.  Either they're happily reunited and he helps us find Valentine... or he just helps us find Valentine.  Let's go.
6910,"Best In Show : Now that the troggs have been taken care of, let's get on with the real show!  You've more than proven yourself as a capable rider - ready to get back in the ring and go big?  See if you can beat three hundred points!"

6913,"Runic Resistance : Whatever is going on with this effigy, I don't think it's going to open the gateway without our help.  These runes must be the key. There must be some way we can use them to activate the effigy."
6914,"Strange Discovery : <A very old ring of Nightelf origin. Seems out of place on this island, perhaps Elise Starseeker will know what to make of it>"
6915,"The King's Gambit : Atal'Dazar is the tomb of kings. MY kings. My greatest followers.  I will taste Zul's flesh before this day is done.  Come, $p, keep up. Our prey has neither the strength nor the numbers to block this entrance. Let us crush this heretic."

6917,"Dungeon: Darkmaul Citadel : Gor'groth seeks to raise a powerful dragon, Ravnyr, from the dead.   He's collected enough life essence to attempt to finish the ritual... even if it means Ravnyr will not be at her full strength.  Gor'groth will not stop until he is slain!  You must storm the citadel and slay Gor'groth before he can complete his ritual!  I would charge in beside you, were I not still recovering from his dark magic."
6918,"War of Shadows : Every war is fought on multiple fronts, <class>.  King Wrynn has tasked Halford Wyrmbane and his 7th Legion with securing our position in Kul Tiras as well as Zandalar.

6919,"Ateena's Fall : You have proven to be a much greater ally dan I could have ever hoped. Thanks to you and your Horde, we have come dis far. Now, there is only one thing dat remains.   We must confront de leader of de blood trolls and put an end to their dark plot once and for all.  Without Ateena's mojo to protect it, we can finally destroy dat monstrosity of theirs before it can be unleashed upon Zuldazar.   You know what must be done.   First, I must prepare myself. Go. I will join you when de battle has begun."

6928,"Archived Knowledge : It seems like this Brother Alen we keep hearing about might have some answers.   At least, I sure hope so. Everyone here seems a bit... evasive.  I think I saw some archivists heading into the southern cloister. If we follow them, I bet we'll find Alen too."
6929,"A Slight Detour : If this coven is drawing its power from these ancient ruins, then I may just know of something that could help us fight back.  Meet me at the first fork along the Highroad Pass. There is something there I want you to see."

Farseer Ori was captured while performing a sacred ritual to call upon the elements for guidance. I managed to escape, but the ritual has been left unfinished.  If we do not rescue my master soon, the elements will grow even more restless.  The elemental balance must be maintained. I fear what may become of my clan and our bond with the elements if Farseer Ori is not returned to us."

6942,"Out Like Flynn : I'm relieved you woke up! Having to carry you would have made this job far less appealing.  The name's Flynn, and my client in Boralus is paying me a king's bounty to break you out of here.  You, my friend, are incarcerated in Tol Dagor. Used to be a legit prison... 'til the Ashvane Trading Company bought it. Now it's Priscilla's own personal fortress, riddled with scum on both sides of the bars.  Wasn't hard to bribe my way into this cell. Now we just have to get out.  Not to worry. I have a plan!"

6947,"Face Your Enemy : We have decided that our best course of action would be to enter the prison disguised as Proudmoore military. Rexxar will be our prisoner.  We want to keep a low profile until we break Ashvane out.  I find that I work better with reference when undertaking this type of endeavor.  I have chosen some humans that interest me. I would like to examine their faces.  Use the Shard of Vesara on them, and they will be... encouraged to find their way to me."
6948,"The Things They Carried : We need to know more about these sailors before we report back.  Ideally, we would invade their camp but there are too many for our small group to take on. Lucky for us, they are focused on their salvage operation over safety. See if you can find any intelligence on their leaders who are scavenging the derelicts."
6949,
6950,"Waycrest Manor: Draining the Heartsbane : The skull you have taken from Korvash needs to be steeped in Gorak Tul's magic to grant the power needed to bridge the gap to Thros. You must take it to a font of his power, and let it absorb his magic.  You will find one such font in Waycrest Manor - the epicenter of the coven's power. Here, their leader has tapped so freely into Tul's power that it emanates from the very walls.  Bring Korvash's skull to the heart of the manor and let it feast. Then, the effigy will be complete."
6951,"Akunda Awaits : I've spoken to every troll out here, asking if they've seen Rakera. As you might have guessed, Akunda is de only name dey know.   Let's hope someone within de temple will be able to tell us something useful."

6953,"Field Evaluation : We got the A.M.O.D. back together. It's a fine piece of equipment, but we're gonna have to give it a tune up. We don't want to end up digging shrapnel out of our rears.  Lucky for us, there are a few naga camps remaining along with the giant that broke the gun in the first place. They'll be great for target practice.  We'll deploy the A.M.O.D. just outside the building here. After we deploy, go man it. I'll have you fire a few rounds while I tune its gun.  Everything'll be fine... unless it isn't."

This would be far too valuable to put anywhere else. I bet they haven't even moved the chest. The problem is the security features.  See, the chest is locked by three keys and he gave each one to a different lieutenant. We'll need to get those.  But between your skills, my finesse and Taelia's air support this will be easy."
6956,"The Stuff Dreams Are Made Of : All that remains is to throw the emerald fragments you collected into the lake. I will use my power to bind them together.  If this works, they will be reforged into a powerful dragonscale that you can use to empower the Heart of Azeroth.  I believe that my mother would be pleased that some of our power will go toward saving the world. I hope she would be proud of us."
6957,"Offerings to G'huun : Been watchin' these cultists with both good eyes.  Those big glowin' jars o' theirs look important.  Opened one up and it sent a shiver down me spine, but nothin' seemed worth the takin'.  If it ain't worth stealin', I guess it's worth smashin'."

6963,Nazmani Cultists : The rumors o' the blood trolls from back in Boralus don't line up with the letters from Captain Conrad.  Open to trade? Willin' to work with us against the Horde? Ready to teach us their magic?  Hogwash.  Only time worth spendin' with these evil trolls is time killin' 'em.
6964,"A Hand in the Dark : Imagine being trapped in a world you didn't know existed--a reality unbeknownst to even yourself.

We shall honor his sacrifice."
6975,"To Mechagon! : Whatever's waiting for us on the shores of Mechagon, we're going to be ready for it with this crew.  I don't hold any misconceptions about how that crazy king is going to welcome us. Guns blazin', I'm sure.  So we're going in quietly on this submarine. Low profile'll keep us all safe.  When you're ready to go, talk to Captain Krooz."

The choice of which to approach first is yours."

With luck I will be able to rewind history and prevent this existence from ever happening."

He told me stories of powerful scrolls, one in particular that he said was meant to be used to put a loa's spirit to rest.  I think you should be the one to read it.

6993,"Fighting With Fire : Excellent! Now that we have these lovely Liquid Fire flasks prepared we have one last thing to do:  Test them out!  There are some of those large abominations lurking about in the woods above my home. I think they would make excellent test subjects for our little alchemical experiment, wouldn't you say?"
6994,"A Weather Eye : It would be wise to get a lay of the land before we put together a plan of action.   Inquisitor Notley is an expert falconer, and a reliable scout. He utilizes an ancient relic to see through the eyes of his falcon, allowing him to survey great distances.   Unfortunately, Notley was injured during the fighting.

I will use the technology here to create a new line of toys unlike anything seen before!  My Quasi-Faceted scanner can help construct perfect replicas of things here on the island.   I just need a helpful individual such as yourself to scan a few things around this area.
7026,"Punishment of Tal'aman : Look, Zolani is going about dis all wrong. If you want de Amani, or anyone, to pay attention, take out their leaders.Go into Tal'aman and look for their mighty gong. Challenge four of their disciples to combat and slay dem."
7027,"Storming the Manor : Now is our chance. Waycrest Manor is just up that hill, and hopefully inside we'll find my mother and father.   If we also manage to find the ""Mother"" that's leading this horrible coven, then we will make her regret the day she ever set foot in Drustvar.  Are you with me, <class>?"
7028,"To the Front : We're at war in the Arathi Highlands. The battle has died down for now, but when it flares up again, we'll need you on the front.  Druza Netherfang maintains a portal directly to Ar'gorok. She can help you."
7029,Taking The Air Out : <This box of rockets could just be used to take out the Venture Co. Balloons. That would really motivate Venture Co. to go somewhere else.>
7030,"Royal Report : Blood magics practiced in de city, guards missing, and our chief spy, Yazma, is acting suspicious. We must present dis to Rastakhan, but without Yazma interfering.Luckily, Rastakhan is a clever king, which is something his opponents often forget.I have prepared a report in a code made by King Rastakhan and known only to myself and my brother, Habutu. Bring it to Habutu and he will see dat it gets to de king's ear."
7031,"Down, But Not Out : <Kua'fon wiggles happily in his new armor. He starts to pace restlessly back and forth. A taste for adventure has surely awakened in this flightless creature.>  Skree! Skree!!"
7032,"Shop Project : As a reward for all your help here, I was planning to fix this old mechaspider mount to give to you.  I could use some more of your help though to get this project started!  I'll need parts off a few of the bots nearby, and maybe you could talk to Cork Stuttgard at Bondo's Yard and see if you can get a Mechanobot Ignition system."
7033,"Sanctum of the Sages : Sounds like you'll be working with us for awhile.  Cyrus will charter a naval transport between here and Stormwind, but I expect you'll want something a bit faster for day to day use.  Head back upstairs and take a left when you get outside. You'll find an old study where the Tidesages used to conduct their magic rituals.  Surely your Alliance mages have already sensed its power.  Inform them they may open their portals there. The harbor guards will keep the room secure."
7034,"The Other Place : In my travels of the many possible futures, I discovered another place much like Rustbolt, but different.  In this other time and place, very little is alive, everything is machines.   You must travel to this other place. You will scan the memory banks of the Clockwork Giants you find there. Then we will use that data to ensure that our Rustbolt never becomes the other place."
7035,"Save A Friend : In the cave ahead is where they are holding Mak.   They torture us. They break us.   Don't let them take her, too."
7036,"Sleep, Eat, Repeat : <The Child of Torcali pushes the sack of herbs around with her snout.  She then looks to you and stomps eagerly in place.>"
7037,"We'll Meet Again : Now, it be time for ya ta leave.   Dere be many of dem blood troll souls for ya ta be sendin' to da Other Side for Bwonsamdi, and ya not gonna find any more of dem here."
7038,"Proof of Tenacity : If the Highkeeper is so convinced that we don't stand a chance against our enemies, perhaps a show of force would sway him.  I am not sure how you would manage, but if you could bring proof of a victory against those who threaten the Vale, it may convince him that action should be taken."
7039,"Freeing the Light : Ah... you are not in league with the ogres. Please, you must aid me.  I have been bound against my will by dark magic. I ask only that you free me.  Take a piece of my light. Use it to dispel the necrotic energies that are keeping me captive."
7040,"Break On Through : Cannon's ready, boss.  Care to do the honors?"
7041,"The Old Knight : These days Cyrus is the Harbormaster, but he used to be one of Daelin Proudmoore's most trusted knights!  I lost my mother when the Scourge hit Lordaeron. My father sent me here to be raised away from the war. I don't know much about him... just that he was a Stormwind knight who gave his life fighting the Lich King.  Daelin hand-picked Cyrus to raise me and forced him to take a desk job. It's the only reason he wasn't at Theramore.  He's probably checking in that other Alliance ship. Let's go!"
7042,"A Bolt from the Blue : You have done much to empower the Heart of Azeroth, and I am proud that the dragonflights have lent their strength to your cause.  It is now time for the blue dragonflight to do the same.  When I first learned of the essences, I knew that some remnant of my dragonflight's power must be out there, coalescing where we were once strong.  That is exactly what I have found. The Kirin Tor have isolated its signature at the Nexus, but only the wielder of the Heart of Azeroth can claim it."
7043,"Lost Shipment : I let grief cloud my judgment and Jaina may have already paid the ultimate price for my mistake. Yet, I hold out hope she lives.  I do not know where Jaina was taken after Ashvane's people took her from the Keep. The records in their offices here in Boralus will surely tell you where they took her.  <name>, you helped my people when I thought I did not need it. I ask for your help again now. Save my daughter's life!"
7044,"A Little Goodwill : It sounds like the peons are feeling undervalued. They do important work for the Horde, but their diligence is often overlooked. A little goodwill would go a long way.   Let's plan a feast in their honor. We'll need quite a bit of meat to sate their enormous appetites, luckily, I have a totem that can help with that.     You acquire the ingredients, and I will make a meal guaranteed to boost morale."
7045,Blueprint: Emergency Rocket Chicken : <This blueprint details how to build what appears to be an aeronautically inclined poultry unit.  You should be able to upload the blueprint to Pascal-K1N6's database in Rustbolt.>
7046,"Infusing the Heart : Azeroth's voice is growin' fainter and fainter. If the seal on this chamber shatters, her soul will be lost!  We've got one chance tae save us all.  Absorb the Azerite around the chamber into the Heart of Azeroth. Then unleash the amulet's power tae seal that crack in the center of the seal.  Azerite can be a destructive force, but if it's channeled through yer amulet, it can heal the world!"
7047,"The Aid of the Loa : De blood trolls are stronger than ever, thanks to dis G'huun... and now dey are empowering a giant construct!  We need a plan to destroy dat construct, G'huun, and de blood trolls. It is not going to be easy.  But I have an idea."
7048,"A Brother's Help : We're gonna need all the help we can get te save the planet.  I've got an idea.  Meet me in Nazmir, outside the Heart of Darkness. Together, we'll seek guidance from someone who may be able to help."
7049,"The Order of Embers : The Order of Embers was the name given to those who took up these arms against the Drust. Using the tools and methods uncovered by the scholars, they were able to counter the Drust's magic, and ensure our victory in the war.  If the coven wants to use the Drust's magic against us, then we'll use the order's weapons against them.  The knowledge of the order rests here, but without a hand to wield it, it will do us no good.   Will you be that hand, <class>? Will you revive the Order of Embers?"
7050,"A Titanic Problem : We've no time tae waste.   Without the Forge of Origination, Azeroth is left vulnerable tae N'Zoth's corruption. Not tae mention it holds a weapon capable of wipin' out all life on Azeroth!  We'll need tae head over tae the forge right away. MOTHER can hold down the fort here.  Hurry on, I'll meet ye there."
7051,"His Eye Upon You : Something dark has taken root within you, <name>. The tendrils of N'Zoth are burrowing into your mind and soul, eager to consume everything you are.  I can perform a rite of cleansing, but only in a place that resonates with the very power that grips you.   Meet me near the Crucible of Storms. The ritual will be perilous and painful, but it is your only chance to be free.  The Old God has eyes everywhere. I do not wish you to become one of them."
7052,"Slumber No More : There's something you should look into. You've got the time anyway, those goblins aren't ready yet.  There's a statue nearby. Only, it's not a statue to the trained tortollan eye. It's a deactivated titan keeper!  Noises have been coming from that thing ever since you helped Krag'wa. It must be trying to reactivate itself.  I bet that titan-looking amulet of yours could help restart it. We'd be unstoppable against the blood trolls with a titan keeper's help.  Go see if you can restart this titan!"
7053,"Mista Nice : I am normally not a violent tortollan, but if there is one thing I cannot abide, it is a scoundrel using children for his own profit.The street scamps appear to be working at the behest of a ring leader. I do believe they call him ""Mista Nice"" though I suspect the name to be sarcastic in nature.I have a scroll here that can let you move among the scamps and see if they lead you back to Mista Nice. If they do, slay him and I shall pay you a bounty."
7054,"Ideas Can Come from Anywhere : I didn't notice the tinkerer's spark in you when we first met.  But look at all of the blueprints you've recovered and uploaded to Pascal-K1N6's database.  I was wrong. And happily so, my budding junkyard tinkering apprentice!  But this is a dangerous moment in your creative development.  You must avoid complacency!  Take time off to find new ideas. Speak with builders that inspire you, reverse-engineer bots on the island, and be open to new ideas - no matter where they come from!"
7055,"Waycrest Manor: The Fallen Mother : This is all a lot to process...  The Marshal... gone? My mother... the leader of the coven? It's just too much...  ...but we have come too far to turn back now. It is clear that my mother and father, as I knew them, are gone.  It is time we cleansed the taint from this land.  We must take the inquisitors and find them in Waycrest Manor. We will end this, once and for all."
7056,Alliance War Effort : Assist the Alliance by completing 4 world quests on Zandalar or occupied warfront zones.
7057,"Upward and Onward : It is sad dat Hir'eek had to die, but at least de blood trolls are weaker now.  My potions are healing me up nicely. I did some looking around and came across dis guy.  He's skittish, but not hostile. I think you can use him to get out of here.  Hurry up and jump on, before he breaks de rope! I'll find my own way out; you don't have to worry."
7058,Blueprint: Encrypted Black Market Radio : <This blueprint details how to build what appears to be a highly encrypted radio transmitter.  You should be able to upload the blueprint to Pascal-K1N6's database in Rustbolt.>
7059,"Unscarred Black Scale : <An utterly pristine black dragon scale taken from the dragons you recently encountered.  The black dragonflight was completely decimated following Deathwing's demise and Wrathion's rise to power.  Yet the size indicates a younger dragon.  There is one person, one dragon, that you know will want to hear of this, but where IS Wrathion?  You surmise he may be some place familiar, fortified, and abandoned.>"
7060,"WANTED: War Gore : By the decree of the Storm's Wake.  Scouts have reported that forsaken scientists have created a monster, sewn together from the bodies of our own fallen soldiers.    This monstrosity is called, War Gore.  The individual that destroys this abomination will earn a fitting reward."

7062,"Thros, the Blighted Lands : The Blighted Lands...   If the legends are true then inside we will witness suffering and torment the likes of which we have never known. ..  ...but if that is what I must endure to right what I have wronged, then I will cross that threshold gladly.  Will you join me, <class>?"
7063,"Buried Power : Since time immemorial, the Drust have used runes to shape their magics. This remains true of the spells woven by Gorak Tul and his ilk. You will need some of these runes for your effigy to be effective.  It is likely that some still exist at the site of his final battle, buried under years of soot and snow.   Take this stone. It is empowered with the magic of the Thornspeakers and will react to Tul's spells. With it, you should be able to locate the runes, no matter how deep the ages have buried them."
7064,"Opening the Way : Hmm. This ritual is a bit... tricky. No matter, together we will be able to complete it.  I shall begin to channel. You will need to activate the runes in the proper order. I shall leave the scroll here so you may consult it."
7065,"Network Diagnostics : Unfortunately, we've got no clue where N'Zoth has been lurking since his escape. We do, however have an idea where he might strike.  Back when the keepers were imprisoning the Old Gods, they built defense mechanisms against their corruption into the titan forges. If N'Zoth wants tae corrupt Azeroth, he'll have tae go through them first.  Fortunately, we've got ourselves hooked up tae them now, so we can monitor them from here. Go ahead an' take a look."
7066,"An Airtight Alibi : It'll take us a while to clean up the beasts that are left over, but I'm confident we'll be able to take back Fletcher's Hollow--thanks to you, of course.  Here, take this letter to the constable. It should be enough to clear Miss Waycrest's name.   I'm sorry you had to witness all of this, mainlander. We are good people, but these are terrible times."
7067,Blueprint: Ultrasafe Transporter: Mechagon : <This blueprint details how to build what appears to be a personal teleporter of some kind.  You should be able to upload the blueprint to Pascal-K1N6's database in Rustbolt.>
7068,Leaving the Hive : <The enormous bee twitches its antennae toward you. It swings its abdomen toward the cave exit.>  Barry might know what's going on.
7069,"Storm's End : I've no doubt he can feel our presence, but so long as Lord Stormsong maintains his spell the first move is ours.   We have him surrounded, cornered like the rat he is. We must end this together."
7070,"Carry On : Let's get to Brennadam right away. We need to find Brother Pike and get to the bottom of all of this before things get any worse.  This road should take us right into town. Brennadam's the busiest market this side of Boralus, so there should be plenty of people there who can help us find Pike.  Ready when you are!"
7071,"Mayhem at Mildenhall Meadery : Ahhhh! <Sir/Miss>, please, I need some help!  My dad hasn't come back from the meadery and, and... well, when I went to look, there were giant globs of honey everywhere.   But... but, somehow, they were moving on their own. I even saw one eat a bunny, I swear!  I'm scared to go back by myself, but I think dad is in trouble.  Can you go with me?"
7072,"Sensitive Intel : I've received a report from Kelsey Steelspark. She claims to have discovered something that will aid our war effort.  She's refused to go into specifics, citing a need for secrecy with such sensitive intel.  It looks like you'll need to speak to her in person.   She's expecting you in Xibala."
7073,"My Punkin, the Action Figure : Heya, <name>.  <Grizzek leans in close and whispers.>  I'm workin' on a surprise for Saffy. Hopin' you can help me out.  I overheard her beggin' Jepetto Joybuzz to make her into one of his fancy new action figures.  That ol' jerk told her no. Can you believe it? My Punkin!  Well, we don't need him. I reverse engineered a few of his toys and found out what makes them tick.  I got a blueprint ready to go. We can make Saffy's action figure ourselves and surprise her with it!"
7074,"Break 'Em Out : An Irontide captain ""Calico McGee"" has been trying to scare us off for days now, but it's not working.  He's ordered his men to lock everyone up and sell us as slaves! They've brought enough chains for everyone!  Break the chains and set our workers free."
7075,"Spy Versus Spy : Naga attacks are on the rise, but that isn't all we have to deal with. We've received word of increased Horde activity near Warfang Hold in Stormsong Valley.  Send some of our operatives to investigate what they are doing."
7076,Bulwark of Torcali : We got Old Rotana up on her feet again. Load up an' take her reins.Give us some cover so Talanji can fight her way in from her side.
7077,"One Gnome's Trash : The garbage in these trash heaps is full of rare metals: Dalaranium, Suramarite, even Gnomeisium!   I've not seen this much easy gold to be had, since they left the vault door open in Boralus! You help me collect some of the metal, and my friend Gao will sell it on the black market.  I've got a device that can tear the metal right out of the trash!"
7078,"Ruin Has Come : There is a terror beneath the waves. It seeks to destroy my family, my house, and my legacy.You must come, claim your destiny and deliver us from the terrors of the deep!Find our estate to the east, among the isles. We lived opulently in the shadow of the great fortress. We believed the priests would deliver us from the darkness below. Now that darkness has bubbled to the surface, whispering madness in our dreams.Hurry. The air turns the darkest I have seen in my cursed existence."
7079,"Adapting Our Tactics : This war will not be won with strength and might alone. Take in your surroundings while you fight and turn it into an advantage against the enemy.  I have a list of modifications for you to choose from. Any one of these might feel small on its own, but together they might just be all the advantage we need.  Let me know what you would like us to pursue."
7080,"Freedom for the Sea : The naga along this coast appear to be trying to push the shoreline up the hill here. We've been able to keep them back at the beach so far, but they've been binding more elementals than we can keep up with.  Without a tidesage, we have no way to free the elementals from their bindings, but we cannot allow them to push forward anymore. The spirit of the sea should not be contained by anything. Slay them, and let them return to the ocean."
7081,"A New Hope : Darkshore belongs to our people once more, in no small part due to your efforts. And, while I disagree with her methods, we would not have succeeded without Tyrande as well.  Differences aside, she is our leader--and an incarnation of the Night Warrior herself.  She is about to begin. You may stand here beside me."
7082,"Operation: Grave Digger : Sylvanas has issued us a mission in Drustvar, where we will find our next target.  Report to the Banshee's Wail immediately."
7083,"An Unending Sleep : <The direhorn hatchling continues to sleep soundly, despite any efforts on your part to wake it.  It's probably been too long. You should speak to Beastlord L'kala.>"
7084,"Storm's Judgment : When I opened my mind to the currents during the ritual, I felt the presence of a member of Lord Stormsong's innermost circle.  Wavespeaker Reid. If anyone can locate the missing fleet, it is him.  I will not stand by while my brothers move against our own people. Oaths be damned.  We must force Reid to see reason."
7085,"In Darkness, I Dream : The green dragonflight calls for aid. The Emerald Dream, which they have watched over for eons, has been invaded by terrible creatures of the Void.  Merithra of the Dream is attempting to combat the threat, but she cannot do so alone. If you seek to empower the Heart of Azeroth with the strength of the green dragonflight, you must first help Merithra save it.  Meet her at the Temple of Elune in Val'sharah, and assist her however you can."
7086,"Exterminate the Vermin : On top of the fury of the overseer, and this ""key"" not being here, we have a pest problem.  Sneaky little vulperan thieves keep ransacking our site. We have taken some prisoner.  We have them around the upper level of the dig site, working off their misdeeds. However, I believe a more permanent solution would be preferred.   Please, oh mighty cobra, give us the honor of getting rid of our prisoners with your most potent venom!"
7087,"Get Your Bearings : I think a proper introduction is in order!  My name is Taelia, member of the Proudmoore Guard and squire of Sir Cyrus Crestfall.  <Taelia salutes firmly.>  Cyrus asked me and Flynn to break you out of that Ashvane prison and get you settled in here at the market, but he neglected to mention that you're with the Alliance.  I must say, it's an honor.  Let's get you up to speed."
7088,"Fond Farewells : Dis is where we part ways, <name>.  I'm going to take de name Akunda, and start a new life here.   When you find Rakera, and I know you will, give her my thanks.   She saved my life, and I'm going to make sure to live a life dat was worth saving.   If you find yourself back in de city, could you deliver dis note for me? I trust you not to open it, though I doubt you could read my scrawls anyway."
7089,"Lil' Tika : <The tiny armored raptor scratches pitifully at the cage's wooden bars. As you approach, the miniscule reptile wiggles frantically and issues a piercing screech for help!Perhaps you can open the cage and let it free.>"
7090,"The Mysterious Island : Fate's End is just that. It's where the very worst criminals are sent. No one ever comes back.  I'm sorry Lady Katherine will have to hear this, but I'm glad it isn't my job to tell her.  <Flynn hands you the document solemnly.>  I'm certain she'll want an update, even if the news is as bad as this."
7091,"Besieged Allies : Seawalls can be rebuilt, but lives are lost for good. We need to secure the rest of the people here first.  The Outriggers have been known as some of the fiercest hunters in these waters. Find their leader, Rosaline Madison, and enlist her aid in liberating Anglepoint. Together, clear the north shore of the Horde, save anyone in danger, and rally the dock workers.  You handle the north shore, <name>. I will handle the south. We'll meet in the middle and crush the Horde between us."
7092,"The Missing Key : Korthek has grown spiteful and arrogant over the years, but I realize now that he has grown mad as well.  Mythrax will kill all of us if he is released.  For too long, I've held out hope that I could convince Korthek peacefully to abandon his heresy. I was wrong.  All of Zandalar is at risk while Korthek and his allies hold even one key to Mythrax's prison.  Meet me outside his fortress in the north. We will confront my old friend ""Emperor"" Korthek and end this together."
7093,"Tortollans in Distress : Our first task is to rescue the tortollans captured by the blood trolls.   Keeshan's report indicates the tortollans are familiar with all things Nazmir. They should know about the Horde's operations here.  The tortollans tend to stay neutral in most matters. They'll give us details on the Horde's plans if we make a fair trade.  We'll meet afterwards at our other outpost, Redfield's Watch, north of Torga's Rest."
7094,"Fairwind's ""Friends"" : Someone must have recognized Flynn and ratted him out! A bunch of Irontide thugs dragged him off to the Ring of Booty for a ""special audience"" with Captain Harlan Sweete.  Flynn doesn't like to talk about this, but he used to captain his own crew. With Harlan as his First Mate.  The two had a falling out after a messy job and Flynn lost all taste for freebooting. Just disappeared one day.  Harlan took the nastiest of the crew and formed the Irontide Raiders.  In other words; it's personal."
7095,"Our Next Target : Welcome back, $p.  We're ready to set sail on our next mission.... Now we just need to reach an agreement on where we're headed.  General Feathermoon and I disagree on which Horde target we should prioritize next. But if you'll give me just a moment, I'm confident I can convince her the value of my strategy and we'll be swiftly on our way.  I've considered every reasonable alternative. This is the best course of action."

7097,"Killer Queen : Lor'danel is now secure, but something is amiss... there has been no sign of Stormrage.   Malfurion would have never let Lor'danel fall without a fight. He must have gone after her.  My army has approached from the North, and our reinforcements have arrived from the South -- which means that they are not along any of the roads.  Search the forest with me, <name>. We will find them and be done with this once and for all."
7098,"A Brief Respite : We have much to do, <name>. However, we are all weary and require rest. Decisions made while fatigued are almost always the wrong ones to make.  The Ankoan have offered their home to us, yet they are barely holding on themselves. We should do what we can to support them while we think about our next move.  See what you can do to aid their hunting parties, it may be the only way we survive in this place."
7099,"Drustvar : The stalwart protectors of House Waycrest hold fast along the western border, but recently all contact with them has been lost. We must secure their aid in order to bring Kul Tiras together under the Proudmoore banner."
7100,"The Castaways : I see the sirens have made another catch. You're lucky they haven't stripped your bones yet.  If you need to trade supplies or just warm yourself by the fire, there's a camp up the hill behind me.  Everyone there washed up in the tides, just like you. Figure we've got folks from at least four or five shipwrecks now. All banded together, just tryin' to survive.  Talk to Stabby Jane. Don't worry about her nickname, she's actually real nice."
7101,"A Way Home : We can harness the power within this place to open a portal home.  I will require your assistance. Isn't this fun? You get to be my assistant!  Ah, yes. Just come with me and all you have to do is wave that Heart of Azeroth of yours around. I'll handle the rest."
7102,"A Trip Across the Ocean : I understand you are to be establishing our foothold in Drustvar. You will be assisted on this mission by Trade Prince Gallywix.  I know, a strange choice, but I am told that there is Azerite in Drustvar, and the Trade Prince was insistent."

7106,"Bringing Down the Fleet : This is it, <name>. We've weakened the Horde enough to make a daring strike on Zuldazar itself.  Our forces in Zuldazar still remain hidden, thanks to the help of the Dark Iron dwarves. That gives us our chance to strike.  Set sail to Zuldazar. We will be gathering our forces there for a coordinated strike to weaken their harbor defenses."

7109,"A Growing Mystery : This runestone could be of Vrykul origins. Is it possible that Vrykul once visited this island?   Where there's one runestone, there's usually more. The roots of lashers are drawn to the magic of runestones. If there are more buried here, the Lasher roots maybe wrapped around them!  Clear these lashers and see if any have runestones tangled in their roots."
7110,"Venture Co. Business Plan : <An enormous volume, and printed in very small print. You can't make it through even a few sentences before the words begin to swim before your eyes.  The Venture Company's long-term plan appears to be quite complex and nearly impossible to understand.  One thing is for certain: a competing enterprise would likely pay well to get their hands on this tome.>"
7111,"Killclaw the Terrible : <You see a crude sign made by the ogres. It contains a warning.>  BIG bear! Bad!  Big bear guard big ogre treasure!  Kill after ritual! Get treasure, make more power!"
7112,"Fishing For Something Bigger : There's a huge fish lurking these waters, and it's been causing lots of problems!   It eats other fish, fishermen, and a lot of expensive gear. I saw it swallow a beautiful Zigby 300 Fishing Rod along with its owner just the other day!  I've got a plan, but I've lost a lot of my equipment in the waters around here. Can you help fish up some of these items for me?"

7114,"A Hunter's Trap : By now, most hunters would have been trained in the art of trapping. Allow me to get you up to speed.  We'll start with a freezing trap. In order to make one, you'll have to forage materials from your surroundings.  Meredy can provide you with a mote of ice. Scavenge the area for the rest of what is required.  And don't delay. You will need that freezing trap to deal with a problem that has cropped up within the camp."
7115,"Deep Sea Defilement : The sea...I understand its screams now. It is as if a veil has been lifted, revealing the chaos that has taken hold.Corrupting such a vast swath of sea cannot be done with simple spells. The cultists must have erected some sort of structures to channel their dark magics through...You must find and destroy them, <name>. Only then can we hope to restore the waters to balance."
7116,"A Tribute for Death : Everything for de ritual is together. Now, it is time to begin.   For dis to work, I must chant de words of old. It is an exhausting task, so I need you to take my mojo fetish and draw de ritual circle, then beat upon de drums.  If all goes well, Bwonsamdi may invite us into de temple.  If not, our souls are forfeit.  Let's not make any mistakes."
7117,"A New Order : Before we leave, I have one more task to ask of you.  While you were busy recruiting our inquisitors and driving the coven away from Arom's Stand, I took the liberty of placing an order with the local tailor.   Using some of the sketches within the tome, I had him put together some uniforms reminiscent of those worn by the ancient order.  Since you will be leading our inquisitors, I think it's only fitting that you present them with their new regalia."
7118,"Held For Observation : <Trader Alexxi hurriedly combines the ingredients.>  That should do it. Go on and get this down your direhorn's gullet.  Don't worry, nothing could possibly go wrong with a concoction made under any kind of duress. Also, do I seem like the kind of goblin who would give you something dangerous?  On purpose?  ... Don't answer that. Hurry, before they stab me."
7119,"The Strength of the Storm : The ritual I must conduct is written on a scroll. To gain access to it, you'll have to break through the dark energies the fallen tidesages have placed around it, with the power of the storm.  This relic can be used to pull purified power from the enslaved elementals. Not only will you be gaining the means to our end, you will ultimately be freeing these spirits from corruption.  Defeat the enslaved elementals and then call their power into the relic."
7120,"The Abyssal Scepter : The Lord Admiral has proposed our next move. It's something we don't think the Horde will expect, but it's dangerous: We're going to steal back the Abyssal Scepter.  Your name came up as someone who could see it through, if you're willing to take the chance.  Meet Lady Jaina at our base in Xibala. She'll have more information for you there."
7121,"Tol Dagor: The Ashvane Overseer : Tol Dagor stands as a well fortified thorn in this nation's side.  As you are no doubt aware, Ashvane has taken every opportunity she could to throw any opposition into those cells. Among those in the jail are members of the Alliance that arrived alongside you and Jaina.  We now have permission and the needed muscle to free them. Meet up with Taelia on the eastern shore of the island, find the overseer, and take his key. With it, we will have access to the weapon vault and cells."
7122,"A Local Guide : I've spent a lot of time as a guest of the Harbormaster and I've come to understand a few things about Flynn Fairwind. If anyone can quickly help you to sort out any clues in Freehold, it will be him.  Flynn's been doing work for Cyrus and can be found in the Harbormaster's office. Show him the contract and recruit him to our cause. Hurry, <name>."
7123,"A Historical Mess : The text on this parchment appears to be Tortollan. Is it possible that Tortollans once resided on this island?    We need to act quickly, before the creatures in this area destroy anymore evidence. Search the area for any signs of Tortollan relics."
7124,"In Bwonsamdi's Shadow : Something is wrong, <name>.  My king is blessed by de loa in ways your kind cannot imagine. He has been given long life, swift healing, and strength beyond most trolls. But still, he lingers on death's door. I can practically hear Bwonsamdi laughing.  Two of his most trusted menders are with him. Go and find out what is taking so long.  I will make sure dey are not interrupted."
7125,"Forbidden Practices : You come at a good time, $p. I have need of a weapon such as yourself.Yazma's spies say dere are blood cultists in our ranks. King Rastakhan has charged me with tracking down any trolls guilty of practicing blood magic and purging dem.Take dis totem, route out those with de stench of blood magic, and cleanse dem from dis holy place.When you are done, tell dat lazy Hexlord Raal to get off his perch and help keep dis place secure."
7126,"Down Into Nazjatar : We have much to do <name>. However our troops are weary and need rest. Decisions made when tired are often the wrong ones.  These ""Unshackled"" have offered to aid us with what forces they have. If we hope to survive down here against Azshara's forces, we will need to support our new allies.  Join one of their hunters and aid them in their tasks, we will remain here and discuss our next move."
7127,"To Gloom Hollow : There's only one safe area in Nazmir that this Rokhan and your other Horde friends could be in. Gloom Hollow.  Lucky for you, it's also close to Krag'wa's den. We used Gloom Hollow as a last stop on our pilgrimage.  Make your way to Gloom Hollow along the path I've marked on your map, and tell any tortollans along the way to meet us there.  They'll be interested in seeing the end of this story. We'll make our way there and grab anyone else we find."
7128,"Twist the Knife : The relics are ours... as it was meant to be.  There is but one more step needed for the great truths to be revealed.  The naga sought to summon their storm from a place that echoes with ancient power. Though this site has had countless names over the ages, you mortals know it as the Precipice of Oblivion.  I will go on ahead and begin preparations. Join me there."
7129,"Hunting the Stalker : Now that you have your trap, we can move onto the true problem at hand.  A strange creature not native to this island has been stalking our camp.  I think we should capture it and see how it can help us.  Set the freezing trap within these ruins to lure it out. We'll see just what we are dealing with."
7130,Ticks : Kill those bloodbellies before dey take off with all of my soldiers! I will have my troops prepare for a flanking charge.
7131,"Shores of Fate : So be it. You are more trustworthy an ally than any army Wrynn would have sent.  We will reclaim Darkshore together, but first we must find Tyrande. Without her at the front, our forces will crumble against the Horde.  She left for the Zoram Strand with a small force not long ago. If we move now, we may be able to find her before the Horde does."
7132,"Against Overwhelming Odds : Your eternal enemy, the Horde, grow in strength and number throughout the Shadowlands.   Will you and your comrades simply roll over and yield to their might?   No, I expect not. It seems that not even death has quelled your thirst for battle.   If you succeed in cutting down your foes, despite the odds, I will reward you handsomely."
7133,"Rastakhan's Might : Do you see de ship out in de bay, <name>?  Dat is my flagship, Rastakhan's Might. It is not here under my orders.  We will deal with de Prophet Zul in good time. For now, those who took my vessel must pay.  You are to bring me de head of Windcaller Ula'jan. De ship does not move without him, and it will not be moving again once he is dead!"
7134,
7135,"The Old Bear : I cannot change your mind, can I? Very well, I may know where you can find your answers.   High in the mountains, there is a hidden alcove of impossibly verdant growth. It is there that the druids of Kul Tiras train in the old ways of the Drust - from before the time of Gorak Tul.  Their leader is a great bear named Ulfar. I know little about him, but few are more qualified to parse the magic of the Drust.  You will find a path to his den along Highroad Pass. Good luck, Inquisitor."
7136,"A Fresh Trauma : Azeroth is strugglin' tae survive, but new wounds are formin' at a rapid pace.  I can sense her cries o' pain risin' from the north... in a place o' ancient power...  <Magni closes his eyes, as if listening to an unseen voice.>  By the Forge! Somethin's gone wrong in Mount Hyjal. The World Tree, Nordrassil, is in danger!  Meet me there, $p. There's no time tae lose!"
7137,
7138,"And Justice For All : Thank you for helping to redeem me in the eyes of my people, <class>. I am in your debt, and I will be sure to let my father know.  In the mean time, I think we should find out what this Heartsbane Coven is, and what they are doing in our lands. I hope the marshal will be able to enlighten us.  First thing's first, though. Care to undo these ropes? They're starting to chafe."
7139,Most Loyal : The Dark Lady anticipated this as a possible outcome. She has prepared a contingency plan to deal with it accordingly.  You are to rendezvous with her in the Ghostlands. Take this hearthstone. It is good for one more use.   She will meet you near Windrunner Spire.
7140,"Prepare for Trouble : With the evidence you've gathered, we can prove that the Ashvane Company was behind the attack.  I would have preferred to do this in private, but I don't think we'll have the luxury. Look around - company men everywhere.   Priscilla's got something up her sleeve...  Let's get some backup before we go in there and cause a scene."
7141,
7142,The Azerite Advantage : We have received intelligence pointing us toward a reliable source of Azerite.  We must move quickly to acquire these resources for the Horde.  Report to the Banshee's Wail to aid in this urgent mission.
7143,"Where the Heart Is : It's time we put Wrathion's plans in tae motion.   He'll be headin' back tae the Chamber of Heart, so we should meet him there."
7144,"To Anglepoint : An attack on Anglepoint Wharf can only mean one thing: the Horde seeks to destroy the seagate there.   This is my home. These are my people. I cannot turn my attention to our operations in Zandalar until we've routed the Horde.  The military will take a little time to mobilize, but in the meantime you and I can face these monsters. If we can't stop them, we can slow them down.  War has come to my shores once more. I will not stand aside."
7145,"Descending Into Madness : As unfortunate as the spreading corruption may seem, I believe it provides us the opportunity to prepare for what lies ahead.  Locate one of these incursions and see what happens when you peer beyond the dark veil."
7146,"Nature Versus Nurture : Greetings, <name>. I am Wingminder Goja.  I overheard the ordeal that Pa'ku has laid at your feet. I can help you.  I oversee this roost at my loa's pleasure. I have seen many eggs become glorious beasts of war. It will be a long road ahead, with many trials to overcome, but de companionship of a pterrordax be a worthy reward.  For now, de little one is young. Simply tend to his needs while he stays in de nest. When he is ready to take on de world he will let you know.  Good luck, <name>."
7147,"Right Bot for the Job : We don't waste anything around here. Every defeated bot gets a second chance!   If I'm going to fix this mechaspider, I'm going to need a few extra wrenchbots working with me.   Use my Bot Re-Energizer on three dead Repeating Wrenchbots and bring them to me, and I'll put them to work."
7148,"The Treasury Heist : The Abyssal Scepter is a powerful tidesage artifact and a serious threat to the fleet. The Horde stole it, but it is being held by the Zandalari in their treasury.  The Storm's Wake has crafted a fake Scepter. Your first job is to obtain the real one without alerting suspicion.  Speak to me when you are ready to go over the plan."
7149,Paint Vial: Overload Orange : <Marvelous Martini could make use of this item.>
7150,"Rustbolt Gramophone : <The large gramophone that you crafted is capable of blasting music across all of Rustbolt.  Now, you just need to find a good place to install it.>"
7151,"War Is Here : We need to move, <name>. We've received word that the Alliance have mounted an attack through Nazmir.  Make for the Great Seal. King Rastakhan and Princess Talanji are there forming a plan of attack.  Make no mistake, we will crush the Alliance. They are fools to attack us through Nazmir."
7152,"Under Their Noses : Figures they wouldn't just put the destination on the crates for us.   Nothing's ever easy, is it?  If the weapons aren't moving on Cagney's ferry, they must be passing through Bridgeport, the shipping hub just up the road.  Bridgeport is protected by a garrison of Proudmoore marines. The Ashvane Company has a lot of nerve moving illegal weapons right under their noses.  Come on, let's check it out."
7153,"Forgotten Memories : Have we met before? I'm sorry... but I don't remember your name.  My name is... Arylina... I think. My memory has been so foggy since the great explosion happened that sent us underwater.  Oh! But look! I can see the sun and the stars again... I wonder what happened?  I used to keep a diary, but I can't find it anywhere. If I just had my diary back, I'm sure I could remember more.  Will you help me find it?"
7154,Blueprint: Utility Mechanoclaw : <This blueprint details how to build what appears to be a feisty robotic hand.  You should be able to upload the blueprint to Pascal-K1N6's database in Rustbolt.>
7155,"An Ancient Curse : <The harsh conditions of Nazmir have not been kind to the stone tablet.  Most of the inscriptions have been worn away but you are able to make out a picture that shows a chest surrounded by glyphs. Above the chest you noticed what appears to be a large floating skull.  Below the images you find a single word ""Aiji"".  The ruins ahead seem foreboding, and you may want to bring some friends to help you. With their help, perhaps you can find the secret of this ""Aiji"" and its treasure within.>"
7156,"Freehold: A Pirate's End : Hey, uh, I don't usually ask for help with personal business, but I know when I'm outmatched.  Someone's gotta take down Harlan.  He's a maniac. The things I saw him do back in the day... that's why I left Freehold in the first place.  H-hey don't think of it as a favor for me--even though it would be a HUGE favor--think of it as making the seas safer for everyone, or something noble like that.  <Flynn leans in and whispers.>  Plus there's a big fat bounty on his head!"
7157,
7158,"An Explosive Entrance : A hat and some smooth talking won't get us in to Freehold this time, so I'm thinking explosives. And I'm thinking we steal them from Ashvane. Fair's fair, right? She takes something from Lady Katherine, we take some Azerite empowered grenades from Ashvane.  Okay, so it's not really the same, but you get where I'm going with this.  Head over to Ashvane's Foundry. Grab the biggest Azerite Grenades you can get your hands on.  While you do that I'm going to get us some air support."
7159,"Pinch of Azerite : I don't have time for idle chit chat! If you haven't noticed, rocks are running around doing who knows what?!  How about you help out and retrieve my chemistry kit. While you're out, smash some of those creatures and collect their dust. Prim will need both of those for the next step of the plan.  Maybe we can figure out what has animated the Azerite."
7160,Stay of Execution : Come. It is time to save a friend.
7161,"Mast Effect : Kua'fon was peering over de edge and managed to fall off de cliff again.  Normally he gets back up here on his own, but it be taking too long this time.  Best go down to de beach and find him. He is probably stuck up one of de ship masts out there.  If he will not come down, you can try bribing him with more fish."
7162,"The Fall of Zuldazar : It's time, <name>. We have the Abyssal Scepter, along with confirmation that the bombs placed amongst the Zandalari fleet are still active.  Unfortunately, even with everything at our disposal, we would still lose a frontal assault against the Zandalari empire.  For that reason, we plan to lure the forces of the Horde and the Zandalari away from the harbor.  Mathias Shaw is holding a meeting nearby, and he has requested your presence."
7163,"Freehold : Well, there she is: Freehold.  You can get anything you want there, provided you can pay for it.   Whether you pay with gold or steel is up to you.  Take a look."
7164,"A Load of Scrap : Hello, friend. Would you like the scoop on the latest invention of the century?It's called the Scrap-O-Matic 1000 and this device can triple, no QUADRUPLE your production capacity as a crafter of armor, weapons or other gizmos you adventurers wander around with.Here, take these pants and use the Scrap-O-Matic on 'em. You'll get the hang of it."
7165,A Curious Discovery : <This crystal shines with a mesmerizing light that you find difficult to avert your gaze from.Perhaps the Unshackled would be able to tell you more about it.>
7166,
7167,"Trial of Truth : Those within our temple have left their past lives behind. They devote themselves entirely to Akunda.   Dis final test is perhaps de most important.   Dis is de moment of truth.   You will speak your name, as you will be known from dis day forth."
7168,"Down But Not Out : Ashvane won't trouble us for now, but our situation remains perilous.  I must consider our next move, <name>. In the meantime we should continue to build upon our relationship with our new allies, the Unshackled. Test them in combat, train them while you can, we will need their aid in the battles to come.  We will show them that through unity there are no obstacles that can stand in our way."
7169,A Sound Defense : Horde forces are attacking Tiragarde Sound. Make them regret every footstep upon our soil!
7170,"The Wildhammer Specialty : Well, if ye didn't find Blood Prince Dreven on yer ship, he must be hiding on the other one.  I can take ye down to it, but the Horde knows we're here now. What do ye say we create some distractions to hold their attention while we hunt down Dreven?  Me Wildhammers are itchin' tae let the hammers fly. Ye want to join us for the first round?"
7171,"Lured and Allured : Lookin' for a friend from the wreck, eh?  If he survived he may have wandered up the path to our camp.  Now if he ain't up there toastin' his buns by the fire, well... lotta poor souls fall victim to the song of the sirens.   You should check the camp before you go wadin' out into the tideway. Ask our leader, Stabby Jane. She'd know for sure if a new survivor showed up!"
7172,"Offensively Defensive : Let me guess, Loti had you kill any trolls dat smelled of blood magic, yes? Well, dat is barely a half measure.See, blood magic comes from de old ways, and our people have only been giving in to its allure since de walls fell on our northern border.Come, we will go for a little ride and patrol de border to Nazmir. Dat is where all dese bad ideas are coming from."
7173,Blood Purification : <You see a strange blood orb that emanates whispers of suffering and destruction.  These must be the source of energy for whatever corruption Hezrel is hunting. They appear easy enough to destroy.  You can see more of these orbs around the temple grounds. Perhaps destroying them will help to weaken the corruption in the area.>
7174,This Ain't Mine : Sylvanas's loyalists have collapsed part of the canyon path to Orgrimmar. Our forces are now cut off from each other.  We need to reinforce our front line or the Banshee will pick us off at her leisure. We have come too far to be slain by a thousand cuts.  Gazlowe and one of the Alliance's gnomes believe they have an answer. You'd best ensure that their plan does not backfire.
7175,The Final Effigy : <The effigy's protection has been broken.  All that remains is to break the effigy itself.>
7176,"Send My Father a Message : My people are once again safe... for now.  King Mechagon won't stop sending his armies at us as long as he does not fear us.  We must send him a message.  Climb to the top of the ramparts, and hack one of my father's projectors to proudly shine the banner of the Rustbolt Resistance big enough for the whole island to see.  I'm sure that'll attract the attention of my father, King Mechagon."
7177,"Scouting the Palace : We cannot hide here forever, <name>. Azshara must be dealt with.It would be an act of folly to assault her palace without knowing what defenses she has in place. I dispatched a scouting team while you were gone, but they have not reported back.I'm getting concerned, <name>. Let me know when you're ready and I'll perform a ritual to see what has happened to our scouts."
7178,"Wriggling Mass : <The tendril writhes and pulsates in your hand as your mind is assailed by all manner of vicious thoughts.  One vision in particular surfaces in your mind again and again.  In your mind's eye, you picture a many-eyed goat laying in a pool of black water. As you approach, its eyes burst open, and in an instant you find yourself looking upward at the goat from deep within the puddle.  As you sink into the icy darkness, everything goes black.  You pocket the mass and shake the thoughts from your head."
7179,"Cutting Edge Poultry Science : <Before you is a delicious chicken... And yet, despite everything, there is something a little bit... lively about this creature.  With a judicious application of science, there might be something that can still be done for this poor bird.  You resolve to bring the chicken to Dr. Oglethorpe in Booty Bay with all haste.>"
7180,"Queen's Favor : I have two things to ask of you, and I do not ask them lightly.  First, I need you to retain the favor of the warchief. She will undoubtedly have questions, and seeds of distrust may begin to grow, but she cannot lose you as an ally. Not now. She would not so willingly part with one of her greatest champions.  In order to do so, it will have to look like you faced me in combat, and lost. I trust you can take a hit.  Second, I ask you not to follow me further. I must make this journey alone."
7181,"A Short-Lived Peace : <name>,  As the Legion's presence wanes from our world, a new threat has risen. It is with a heavy heart that I must ask you to put your life on the line for the Alliance once more.   I have received a disturbing message from our operatives stationed in Orgrimmar.  I await your arrival at Stormwind Keep to discuss matters further."
7182,The Shadow of Gilneas : Champion of Gilneas!  I have a letter for you from Princess Tess Greymane. She requests your presence in Stormwind Keep.
7183,"Test Case #1; Mech vs. Mekkatorque : Alright, we got PLENTY of Azerite in this baby to blow up Mekkatorque and his airship.  That radioactive freak is gonna pay for sendin' his toys to attack one of MY, er, OUR bases!  Hop in, <name>. We got a gnome to blow up."
7184,"Competitive Devotion : Okay, I know dis situation is serious, but she gave you de power of her loa? Sounds to me like Loti is more big on recruiting than on dealing with dis blood troll threat.Inside de temple behind me are three guardians. When I walked in dere, de things tried to kill me. Me!Someone has corrupted our own guardians.Here, I will lend you de voice of my own loa, Pa'ku, de pterrordax. Use it to crush dis corruption."
7185,"On the Outskirts : If things are settled for the Commander, you should check in on Nisha.   I'm sure she could use your help."
7186,"A Forlorn Hope : <Lady Katherine's jaw sets.>  I refuse to believe I am too late.  No one has ever come back from Fate's End, but if anyone could survive I have to believe it would be my Jaina.  Go to Stormsong Valley and secure transit to Fate's End from the tidesages. Brother Pike is a good place to start.  Hurry, <name>."
7187,"Terror of the Kraul : By all the gods of the sea, what a monster!I can barely believe what I am seeing, <name>. This ettin has undergone the same ritual that the brutes do, and it seems even angrier! If he gets out of here, we won't stand a chance.I know I ask the impossible, but I must: kill this monstrosity and save the whole valley from its wrath! Here, take one of the potion samples you brought me. It's probably dangerous, but you might need it to defeat this beast."
7188,"The Eve of Battle : <name>, we must speak of the Horde... and the warchief.  The war has proven costly, and the battle against Azshara drained what little resources we had left. The Horde is divided once more and the Alliance fares little better than we do.   Sylvanas is now in a position to destroy everyone she considers an enemy. That means us, as well.  I had hoped that my old friend would see reason, but now...  High Overlord Saurfang is rallying those of us who remain--including some unlikely allies."
7189,"Krazzlefrazz Outpost : I already did a bunch of the leg-work for settin' up our foothold. All we gotta do is finish deploying all the instant-base technology, and we'll be good to go here in Drustvar.  Why don't you go finish the base building. I'm gonna see if I can salvage any wolfercycle parts."
7190,"The King's Death : King Rastakhan is dead, the Zandalari fleet has been decimated, and we have lost valuable soldiers.  The Dark Lady is on her way from Orgrimmar to assess the situation. We must figure out our next move before the Alliance strike again.  I believe protocol now would be to pay respects to the fallen king. We will determine our next move afterwards."
7191,Emission Free : We're going to need a few Empty Energy Cells to fill out the battery pack on the mount control assembly.   See if you can find me these.
7192,"Trinkets and Baubles : Beneath the tides, these terrors do not see fit to stay within their warrens.They have emerged in the night, stealing away to the villages and indulging in their avarice. They will use the provisions against us, to serve in their rituals. Rituals of summoning and communion with powers too terrible to comprehend. The populace is no concern of mine anymore, but I would not see these briny thieves to have their way. Relieve them of their plunder, and let them learn a bitter lesson."
7193,"Shrine of the Storm: Whispers Below : We must not let Lord Stormsong finish his work.  If he delivers the fleet to Azshara, all of Kul Tiras will be vulnerable. Countless innocents will perish -- or worse.  There is no time to wait for more of the Storm's Wake to arrive. We finish this now, for the good of all who call this valley home.  We finish this for Samuel."
7194,"A Mech for a Goblin : Gallywix has a plan to deal with the Alliance and has requested your help. It involves the Azerite you reclaimed.  Speak with him down at Bilgewater Bonanza, and do whatever you can to help him... when it comes to the interest of the Horde.  Oh, and make sure Gallywix stays alive. The Alliance already tried to kill him."
7195,"A Daughter of Torcali : It has long been remarked upon that a direhorn is de bravest beast in de jungle. That is why they are chosen as mounts for our warriors.  In this case, that bravery may not be in your favor. De little one has run off and I do not think she is hungry this time.  Best find her before she gets hurt."
7196,"Strangling Root : <The root twists and struggles in your grip, attempting to wrap itself around your arm.  The keepers you encountered must be powerfully attuned to nature to imbue their creations with such longetivity.  Remembering the ferocity with which they fought against you makes you suddenly uneasy.  Why would these guardians of nature behave this way?  Surely, someone must have the answers.>"
7197,"Journey to Nazmir : It is time to put an end to de blood trolls in Nazmir before their monstrous horde descends upon Zuldazar.  My most loyal followers are willing to come with me to dat cursed place. But it will not be enough.  I am relieved dat you and de Horde are willing to help. Rokhan and his darkspears are getting ready to leave.  I will finish my preparations here. Meet with Rokhan and make your way to Nazmir, I will see you there."
7198,"Your Next Move : Princess Talanji plans to travel north to Nazmir. The blood trolls there are a threat she believes her father refuses to acknowledge.  General Jakra'zet detests the Horde and cannot be trusted. As long as he remains in power, the city will never be safe.  You will also need to win over King Rastakhan here in Zuldazar. This city is vast and has many secrets."
7199,"Orders from Azshara : <Kojo studies the medallion and grimaces.>  Ugh... naga.  This medallion is inscribed with orders. Looks like naga have been commanded to invade our shores and seize artifacts of great power.  You know, I recently came upon one such object. See that dagger over there? Nasty thing. Gives me the willies. I swear I hear it whispering to me.  I found it on an island in Stormsong Valley, on a makeshift altar. Maybe if you take it there, you'll get an idea of how the naga intended to use it."
7200,"Into The Darkness : We are in Nazmir to stop de blood trolls from destroying Zuldazar. Dis is de start of our campaign to end dem.  Dese monsters want my kingdom and its people destroyed. We are going destroy dem first.  My father thinks de blood troll threat will go away on its own, like it did in de past. But things are different now.  Rokhan and de others are moving north of here to establish a camp for us to stay in, den dey will join us in de fight.  Are you ready?"
7201,Legacy of the Mad Mage : <This rather large jewel has an inscription etched on its base:  Property of Mardivas. If found please return to my laboratory.   Perhaps this laboratory can still be found somewhere?>
7202,"The Port of Zandalar : King Rastakhan has given me orders to investigate de Harbor of Zandalar. De claim Princess Talanji has levied against General Jakra'zet for failing to maintain de safety of our kingdom is a serious accusation.For dis task, I would have you join me so dat I might have an outside perspective. When you are ready, meet me in de Grand Bazaar."
7203,"Good Girl : I have learned so much by your side, I can't believe how many naga we've taken down!  When you first arrived, I was skeptical that you'd make a difference. We've been down here, fighting, for so long. I had almost lost hope.  But now, we see a way out of the darkness of the depths, finally!   I took in a snapdragon pup when we formed Newhome, been training her ever since. I think... I think I'd like you to have her.  She'll make a great mount... and loyal friend."
7204,"Security First : Many dangerous creatures and allies of my father still seek to destroy us.  Help secure this island, seek out and and eliminate five of our most powerful enemies."
7205,
7206,"Perfect Tidings : Your timing is most convenient, <class>.  Our team had a check-in planned for this place, two days past. None have yet returned.   I did not want to be brash and send word to the city too soon. However, I cannot leave this place empty, nor can I abandon young Koba.   Take this scroll. See who, or what, you can find. Bring back those you can."
7207,"Eldritch Invocations : This is my fault, my friend.The leader of these cultists is none other than Director Deepwarden, a man who I once trusted as an advisor and business partner.It seems he did not approve of how I ran our operation... to a ludicrous degree.He gave his humanity for power, using his frustration to overthrow the village from the inside. Who knows what he plans next.I can no longer stand idly by. Take out Deepwarden. Show him that Anglepoint will not fall to his madness."
7208,"Grand Theft Telemancy : They must not keep the Eye, <name>.  Fortunately I am more than an archaeologist. I am a telemancer. Chief Telemancer Oculeth himself trained the woman who trained my master. I can retrieve the relic with these arts.  All you need to do is place a telemancy beacon near the Eye. I can then retrieve both it AND you safely back to camp. The Alliance will find themselves empty-handed.  While you're at it, do deliver my ""thanks"" to the individual responsible for snatching the Eye out from under us."
7209,"A Risky Ploy : Things are worse than we thought. These people are about to tear Brennadam apart!  We'll never get a chance to talk to Brother Pike in this mess.  I have an idea, but if it doesn't work, well... I hope you have your running boots on.  Trust me?"
7210,"Running Late : I beg your pardon, but I am a little concerned at Lord Waycrest's tardiness.  I'd hate to be a bother, but would you mind checking on him? The ceremony awaits his presence.  You can find him in the bride's room, at the top of the tower."
7211,Rustbolt Rebellion : Aid the Rustbolt resistance.
7212,"We Can Fix It : <This drill rig looks capable of breaking through the nearby debris, but is clearly broken.  If you can collect the parts required, Prince Erazmin should be able to show you how to repair it.>"
7213,"Enforcing Fate : Vol'jamba is busy consolidating his power. His Sight has shown him dat he will fight, and perhaps even dat he will die, and so he looks to all his tools to save himself.  I will need you to be my hands, as he will come as soon as I show myself. You will undo all de preparations he has made for dis day.  Do as I say and we will both find ourselves enjoying de king's favor."
7214,"Let Sleeping Wolves Lie : Tess's essence now wanders a section of the Emerald Dream I have twisted into her thoughts. And I have given her my gift, but she could still use a guide.  Enter the Dream through the portal behind me. It will place you near where she sleeps. See if you can help show her how rage may blind a mortal."
7215,"Vinyl: Battle of Gnomeregan : <This pressed vinyl is surprisingly still intact. Its label says it contains the recording of a song called ""Battle of Gnomeragan.""  You should be able to install this vinyl into the gramophone back in Rustbolt.>"
7216,
7217,A Display of Power : It looks like all the big players are here. This thing's gonna be starting any moment now.  You'll probably want to get a good seat.
7218,"The Vol'dun Plan : Our target: Arlethal Sunwatcher, High Examiner of the Reliquary.  Before we charge off blindly into the dunes, however, I'd like to hold a quick strategy meeting with you and the others."
7219,"It Belongs in My Mech! : Check this out! It's my latest creation that someone else came up with and built, Gallywix's Mech of Death!  I got it fueled with all that Azerite you found, but I still need more of the stuff to give it that extra kick.  I was SUPPOSED to have the stuff from our operations here, but there's some sorta Azerite goop causin' a mess!  My guy Patch made an Azerite vacuum device. I want you to suck the Azerite outta these slimes!"
7220,"Leave None Alive : Our initial assault was a success. The Dark Iron dwarves are holding the line. Now it's our turn.  You and I must cleave a path through these Zandalari and eliminate them. Our forces will handle any that remain.  Our goal is to weaken their forces and find two important targets: the ship's captain and its advisor.  Let's go, <name>. If we fail here, all of our efforts will be thwarted."
7221,"Vinyl: Mimiron's Brainstorm : <This pressed vinyl is surprisingly still intact. Its label says it contains the recording of a song called ""Mimiron's Brainstorm.""  You should be able to install this vinyl into the gramophone back in Rustbolt.>"
7222,"Let's Bee Friends : We just need to collect some slime from the animated honey creatures that are still roaming around the farm.  If you can bring back a few vials of that, we can put all our ingredients together and give the mixture to Bumbles.  We should only feed him once a day, or he might get sick like some of the other bees.  We're gonna have him all healed up in no time!"
7223,"Operation: Heartstrike : We've taken out quite a number of high priority targets, <name>. All thanks to your help.  It is time to strike directly at the heart of the Zandalari empire.  Report to the Wind's Redemption as soon as you are able. We will get started from there."
7224,"Loaded for Bear : <This glittering cannonball stands out from the others. You notice the familiar sheen of Azerite across the surface.You can't help but notice the nearby cannon, conveniently pointed at the ships loaded with stores of Ashvane Company weapons.>"
7225,"Mending Body and Soul : Good. You have brought me the last ingredients I will need to concoct a solution to close the king's wounds.  You are not a moment too soon. He is fading.  I am not comfortable working at an elevated pace, but the situation requires it. You must be my hands, for I am very slow.  Bring me what I need, and let Jamil and I worry about the rest.  Speak to me when you are ready to begin."
7226,Foothold: Nazmir : The swamp of Nazmir is home to the notorious blood trolls.  Captain Conrad has been dispatched to determine how we can use their hatred toward the Zandalari to our advantage. Reports from the jungle have proven disconcerting at best.                       - Mathias Shaw
7227,"The Burden of Proof : I think we have everything we need to conduct three of the villagers' tests. Let us hope this is enough to convince them.  I'm sure Constable Framer is champing at the bit to proceed with his trial, and I would prefer it if you were the one to administer the tests. I may not know you well, but I trust you farther than the constable.  Speak with him when you're ready to begin.  ...and do me a favor. Make this quick."
7228,Forcing Fate's Hand : I got some good news and bad news for you about this whole quest to destroy the herald of G'huun. Bad news first.  There's an entire army of skeletons between us and the next area. I'm guessing they used Torga's blood to animate them.  Good news is that scroll you recovered from Holbruk can summon the powerful Hand of Fate.  ...and the bad news is that the scroll got damaged when Holbruk died and is only good for one more use.  Meh. Take this scroll and destroy that skeleton army!
7229,"Rig Robbing : I'm out here tryin' to enjoy my break, but I ran outta hooch.  Got some grog hidden in the water just off the dock, stashed in a crate tied up to some of the rigging.   Do me a favor and fetch it, will ya? Rigging's pretty tangled so you might have to pull in a few lines before you get the right one.  I'd do it myself, but if they see me they're gonna force me back to work unloadin' them new weapons."
7230,"Torga, the Turtle Loa : Name's Lashk.  We're not here to join any cause, we just want to hear Torga's legendary stories.  I don't know if he'll help, but you can try persuading Torga, loa of the turtles, and see if he'll help you fight these blood trolls.  You can join on our pilgrimage to Torga, just keep quiet. Follow the path and find Kisha, she'll tell you where to go."
7231,"Make Loh Go : Hello, <name>! We tortollans grow up hearing the stories of Loh, a tortollan who had many adventures. These stories help to challenge a young tortollan's mind as they try to figure out how Loh would make his way through any given adventure.  Care to give it a try?"
7232,"Through the Old Roads : Lady Waycrest has entrusted me with securing the town of Falconhurst and the services of Master Alchemist Ashton who lives there. However, I have found out no one has heard from Falconhurst in some time.  The skies above the forest are impassable, so we must travel the old roads through Drust ruins in the mountains. A small capable party has a better chance to bypass the growing forces of the witches and to help secure Master Alchemist Ashton.  To that end, I ask you to assist me."
7233,"Operation: Bottom Feeder : It is time for Zelling to prove his worth to the Horde.  Return to the Banshee's Wail. Today, we sail out to open waters."

But how can we get to de top of dat building... ah, of course! Krag'wa!   De loa of frogs hates de blood trolls. I am sure he will lend us his aid. Then, finally, we will be able to put an end to Ateena's madness."
7235,
7236,"Notched Coin : <This old, worn coin has clearly changed hands many times. The edges are rusty from years in the salty air of the Great Sea, and it features an unusual design.  You saw a number of these coins scattered around the island, they appear to be quite commonly used.>"
7237,"Loose Ends : Our campaign against the Horde is going strong, but there are some loose threads to take care of.  Lady Ashvane was broken out of Tol Dagor - by the Horde. We don't know where she's gone or what she is planning. I sent Kelsey out to track down some Ashvane Loyalists to get answers. She found them and has requested backup.  She's waiting for you in Freehold."
7238,"Grab and Go : Nothin' left to do but grab that Marshal and bring him back up to the surface, then.  Though I guess you might as well search the shipwreck for anything else of value. You spent all that time gettin' down there, and time is money."
7239,"Grizzled : I saw a particularly ugly and quite agitated goblin barking orders at the rest of the miners.  I'm willing to bet he's crucial to their entire operation. If you can get into the mine and eliminate him, hopefully it will throw things into disarray."
7240,
7241,"The Bulk of the Guard : If all has gone according to plan, Proudmoore has sent her elite forces to recapture her son's body.  Let's make sure they stay out of the way of our real mission, hmm?"
7242,Junkyard Treasures : Everyone here needs to work hard to find resources for our cause.   Locate and open ten mechanized chests on the island.
7243,"Test Drive : There's still a lot of work to do, but it's running! We need to give the engine, brakes and gyro-balance actuator a good test.   You want to take it out for a drive and see how well they work?"
7244,
7245,"Friends In Need : I doubt that will be the last we've seen of Priscilla, but at least she is no longer one of our immediate concerns.  We must think carefully before making our next move. In the meantime we should continue to build upon our relationship with our new allies, the Ankoan. Work with them to secure the area and hone their skills, we're not out of the woods yet.  I fear the biggest battle is still to come. Let's show them that together we can take on Azshara's forces and succeed!"
7246,"Shakedown : Where are de guards?   Princess Talanji has convinced King Rastakhan to permit outsiders in our port. For de first time in centuries, we have allowed non-trolls to set foot on our shores and peddle their wares.  And now trolls of lesser tribes seem to think dey can take advantage of these merchants?  I will not allow dis sort of behavior. While I investigate why de merchants are not protected, I want you to work your way through de bazaar and slay any thugs you find.   Send dem a message."
7247,"A Friendly Face : An essence of black dragonflight magic is not to be trifled with, <name>.  My flight has been the pawn of dark forces in the past. I owe it to my fallen kin to see that our power is never used for evil again.  I would like to journey with you and meet your allies. Perhaps my knowledge can help you use this essence to defend our world."
7248,"Under False Colors : If we wish to stay the executioner's axe, we'll need to throw Sylvanas off of our scent. I will take the ship near Chandlery Wharf, which has recently been taken by Irontide pirates. There, I will leave it under the guise of a pirate raid gone wrong.  Your task will be to ensure that Sylvanas' forces find this ship.  You must report to Nathanos that you spotted a stolen Forsaken vessel in that area.  You have no connection to Derek Proudmoore, so it should raise no suspicions."
7249,"Gaining the Upper Hand : We need to retrieve the Abyssal Scepter and get out of here before the Kul Tirans break our line in Plunder Harbor.  I did some research while you were gone. I believe I uncovered the location where the ritual must take place.  When you are ready to go, we can make our way over."
7250,"Tal'gurub : My prophet is a loyal servant, but he has his own ideas of how things must be.I am sending him to Tal'gurub to deal with a mess of his own making. One of his pupils, a witch doctor by de name of Vol'jamba, has taken de Gurubashi enclave as his own and has ousted my guards.Meet Zul at Tal'gurub and ensure dis nuisance is dealt with. Do not let him get... distracted."
7251,Blood in the Tides : Curse these slimy wenches!  Their singin' sets men's hearts afire and their brains adrift.   My ship's aground. My cargo's lost.  Nothin' for it now but to fight!
7252,Paint Vial: Copper Trim : <Marvelous Martini could make use of this item.>
7253,"Zanchuli Disbanded : I would like to say we are doing well, but we are not.De Zanchuli Council is broken. Raal and I are all dat remain who are still loyal to King Rastakhan. You best bring news to your Horde and tell dem what transpired here.Raal and I will rally what support we can and head for de Zocalo.And hero, thank you for saving my life and my loa."
7254,"From the Maw of Madness : Sam is still out there somewhere. We can't just leave him to die!  If he wasn't in the assembly yard, he must be on that ship. You have to find him!"
7255,"Intercepted Orders : Good to see you again, $p.  Mathias and I are discussing what to do with new intel that his SI:7 agents procured for us.  The intercepted letter contains orders from Warchief Sylvanas for an operation the Horde is undertaking at sea.  This could be a rare opportunity, or a distraction. The letter is purposefully light on details, and it's unclear if we should make this a top priority or focus on our other missions.  Do you have a moment to talk through this with Mathias and me?"
7256,"Zalazane Returns : <name>, I have never needed your help as much as I do this day. My home be under attack.  I only just heard myself. Master Gadrin be callin' for aid. Zalazane, an old enemy of da Darkspear, has returned to da Echo Isles and has brought with him an army of da dead.  Zalazane be a traitor who has slain many Darkspear and defiled their souls.

7257,"When Spirits Whisper : Ah, <name>! I am pleased the Earthmother guided you here. I have a message for you.  Chieftain Bloodhoof asks that you join him in Thunder Bluff at once.  I will leave it to our leader to explain why you are being summoned. But I will say that Baine has met with the other spiritwalkers and your name was spoken with urgency.  I suggest you hurry."
7258,"Defenders of Daelin's Gate : Daelin's Gate has protected the southern channel for decades. If it falls, the pirate fleet can sail straight into Tiragarde Sound!  The marines at Vigil Hill will need our help. Let's go!"
7259,"Remnants of a Shattered World : The knowledge gained from these visions affords us a unique opportunity to further protect one's mind from corruption. To continue our research, we must investigate the deeper mysteries of these experiences.  Seek out those of power within these visions. Should you come across anything of interest do not hesitate to share your findings.  In the meantime, MOTHER and I shall continue our research here in the chamber.   We await your return, <name>."
7260,"Upheaval : So many lives lost... And the attacks from the naga are relentless!  I apologize, $p. This attitude is unbecoming of a king.  We have no time to lose musing of our own plight.  Let us meet with Jaina and descend from this perilous place into the unknown."
7261,"Big Hunter Mon : In these valleys, the Mon be kepin' beasts alive only to serve as sport. For his entertainment.  The lives of others not be so cheap. Even the smallest creature can cause a whole lotta trouble. The Mon gonna be learnin' to respect that.  I think this be a good time to teach this Big Hunter Mon a lesson, don't you? Be you my faithful messenger?"
7262,"No Problem Too Small : These problems might seem small, but they will eat away at the Horde over time if they remain unaddressed.   We must offer our help.   The vulpera are skilled at solving problems, no matter their size.  I will investigate the outpost. Nisha and Meerah will see to the others.  Meet me in the Twilight Highlands when you're ready."
7263,"Settling In : Whatever Azshara is up to, this *ahem* great new landscape we have found ourself in is terribly inconvenient.   Too many getting too close to our home. We have moved most of the refugees deeper into the cave.  Could you ask Telur to move our calling conch inside?   Grab some of Slen's Elixir and check in with Vim.  Once it is set up, test it out!   I'm off to do a progress check!"
7264,"The Missing Link : <Though burned, portions of the note in the architect's hand remain legible.>  They are... everywhere... disguised...  Encrypted... blueprints...  Cipher...  Pontus... watching me...  <The cipher must be needed to read the ship blueprints. It seems Pontus is the likely holder.>"
7265,
7266,"Into the Heart of Tiragarde : Step one is to establish a more suitable base of operations. A pirate's den will do in a pinch, but I believe the warchief expects better of us.  Let's split up and push farther inland, to the west. Be on the lookout for something defensible and inconspicuous."
7267,"Gonk, Lord of the Pack : You can find Gonk in his lair west of here, in de Garden of the Loa.You should be able to see his totems. Run near dem to improve your speed.I will continue to purge de heretics from dis temple.Mind your manners around de loa, or he may rip your throat out."

7270,"Glittering Scarab : <A magical trinket found on a tol'vir spellcaster, it appears to augment their casting abilities.  It seems to be very old, but is nearly pristine in form.   The tol'vir of Uldum may know more about the sudden appearance of the Amathet.>"
7271,"Ending the San'layn Threat : Blood Prince Dreven has barricaded himself in the lowest deck of this ship. He's trapped down there.  Don't think that makes this easy for us. A cornered beast is more dangerous than a free one. But, if we have the will and wisdom, he can be slain.  Follow me. I will break the barrier blocking his lair and we will face him together."
7272,The Final Foothold : We have established two critical footholds in Kul Tiras. The time has come to establish the third.  Let's review the battle plan when you're ready.
7273,
7274,
7275,
7276,"Knock His Bot Off : I need to rebuild the main powercore. It's a 500S Mekronic so I'll need the operational schematics to get the work done. Only person I know who has a copy of that is Bondo Bigblock.  We're going to need Bondo's help to finish this. Maybe if you ask him, he'll lend us his schematics."
7277,"Grim Tidings : Ey mon, dat dark ranger, she be lyin' to ya!  Saurfang knew dey'd be comin' for him. He sent me to watch da pass, see who his assassins be. Try to warn him if I could.  She not be reportin' back nothin'... she gonna kill him. Most likely got a whole buncha deathguards just waitin' for her signal.  We gotta stop dem! Ya wit' me?"
7278,"Stinging Barbs : The Outrigger hunters exhibit the pinnacle of Kul Tiran brawn. But they would indubitably be unable to succeed in taking down the most impressive of their prey without my own inventions!  I present to you, the most ordinary of harpoons. However, with just a tad of gnomish ingenuity, this average weapon can become so much more!   All that I need are barbs from the rays in the harbor. Using them, I can fashion a poison that can stun even the most colossal of sea monsters!"
7279,"Cracking the Curse : <In her haste, it looks like Helena left her spellbook behind. The pages of this book detail the ritual that she used to entrap the villagers of Fallhaven.   It seems the effigy holding the spell in the village is protected by smaller ones surrounding the town. If these are destroyed, you may be able to affect the one holding the spell on the townsfolk.>"
7280,"When a Plan Comes Together : Having Derek Proudmoore's body in our possession is a greater boon than we had planned for.  Valentine is risen, but I think it best to allow Derek to lay dead for a bit longer.  It's time to use our new allies to our advantage."
7281,
7282,"Abduction Reduction : We got actual ABDUCTIONS happenin' here, <name>!  Honest to gold, flying robots are swoopin' into town and snatchin' up people like it's closin' time at Gallywix's buffet!  Lucky for the Rustbolt Resistance, Gazlowe called in me and my explosives to save the day.  You wanna pitch in? Take one of my rocket launchers and blast those containment crates outta the sky.  Whatever they've got trapped inside will come tumblin' down real fast, so you gotta run underneath and catch 'em."
7283,"Create Your Own Strength : For something that has been sitting on the ocean floor, there is still power to be found in this item.  Take your piece of Benthic armor to Voidbinder Zorlan. He has been eyeing it with great curiosity.  Go ahead and humor the ethereal and let him have a look.  Maybe he has something to offer."
7284,"The Vanishing Lord : Unfortunately, we don't have any contacts within House Waycrest, so our efforts in Drustvar will have to start from the ground up.  We have arranged for a ferry to take you to Fallhaven - a farming village in eastern Drustvar. The mayor there, Cyril White, is a longtime friend of the Proudmoores, and I think he can help us get in touch with someone from the house.  I hope you can get to the bottom of their absence, <name>. Their martial might is invaluable to the Kul Tiran fleet."
7285,"Aid From Nordrassil : Look at what they've done to this island, <name>.  Nature is nearly extinguished, its death cry falling on the deaf ears of mechagnomes.  But I have heard the teeny tiny animals of Mechagon, and bring aid from afar!  It won't be easy to restore balance to a land so severely wounded. Nature's scars run deep here.  Thankfully, we are not alone. I've brought living sap from Nordrassil, the World Tree of Mount Hyjal. Use it to regrow the forests and speed nature's recovery in this land."
7286,"The Warfront Looms : Our focus must expand beyond Kul Tiras. The Alliance still presses against our forces in other parts of the globe.  We are most interested in the Arathi Highlands, near Stromgarde. We've set up an encampment in the area, with the intent of capturing Stromgarde.  Speak with Throk, the recruitment officer for the division in charge of this particular warfront. He could use a good <class> like you."
7287,Tiragarde Sound : We must convince Katherine Proudmoore to pledge Kul Tiras to the Alliance. Flynn believes the Ashvane Trading Company's new gunpowder is our best lead.
7288,"The Waycrest Daughter : You seek House Waycrest? Oh, your timing could not be worse!  I had just received a raven regarding Lord Waycrest's daughter, Lucille, shortly before this... curse came upon us.  They apprehended her in Fletcher's Hollow and are taking her to trial.  They say she is a witch, herself!   If she's found guilty, she will surely hang! You must make haste to Hangman's Point.  With what you've seen here, maybe you can convince them of her innocence."
7289,
7290,"Papers, Please : All this legwork will be for nothing if we can't show Katherine hard proof linking the Ashvane Company to the freebooters here in Freehold.  Ashvane might have been careful to encrypt their books, but I doubt the dockmaster here has any reason to be so secretive.  Check his office and find us something--anything--that connects him to Ashvane."
7291,"Druidic Fur : <This fur teems with natural magic. The beasts you fought on the island were clearly not beasts at all, but druids.  At least they were before.  What could have caused them to become feral?  You did not want to slay them, but they gave you no choice, didn't they?>"
7292,
7293,"Stepping Through the Darkness : By now you've noticed the protection of your cloak wavering the deeper you delve into these visions.   To further bolster your resistance to N'Zoth's influence, we will need to gain an even deeper understanding of his nefarious power.  Seek out knowledge from manifestations deeper within the visions, and we shall have our answers soon enough."
7294,"Scrying Stones : I have a gift for you, <name>.   This stone is unlike anything you may have seen before. To the uninformed, it appears to be a simple rock, but it is far more precious than that.  This is a scrying stone. It reveals objects that have been hidden by magic. When near an anomaly, the runes etched within will begin to glow.   Use the stone to reveal treasure hidden away by ancient magic."
7295,"Breaking Out Ashvane : The Dark Lady wishes to gain another potential ally in the fight against the Alliance.  Lady Ashvane, head of the Ashvane Company, was one of the greatest enemies of Kul Tiras until her capture.  We are going to release her.  Meet Valtrois in Tiragarde Sound. She and Rexxar are working out a plan to break Ashvane out."
7296,"Telaamon's Purge : Telaamon, de Lightbringer leadin' dis assault, be in Hir'eek's cave. He must be thinkin' he can take us all by himself.  When he is dead, we be sendin' dis assault force into chaos, allowin' us ta be marchin'  on de Alliance along de shore.  And hopefully, we can be findin' de source of de fog and destroyin' it.  Da three of us be ambushin' Telaamon once ya start fightin'. He ain't gettin' outta here alive."
7297,Down by the Riverside : We have de aid of Krag'wa and de Gob Squad. We must get back to Zul'jan and begin our plan to stop de blood trolls.  We have one problem. De Gob Squad are unable to move their mech fast enough in de jungle. We must take it by boat.  De two of us will ride with dem and ensure de blood trolls do not destroy de mech.

7301,"Sabotaging the Pa'ku : Our first job is to plant some bombs along these ships. I'll take care of the smaller ships, you deal with the Breath of Pa'ku.  Whatever that means.  Kelsey says these bombs are the latest in gnome technology. We plant 'em and she can detonate them at any time.  Let's get moving, and remember, this whole plan works as long as they don't see us plantin' these bombs."
7302,Paint Vial: Fel Mint Green : <Marvelous Martini could make use of this item.>
7303,"A Mote of Cosmic Truth : We stand on the brink, you and I. The final act looms over us, casting a terrible shadow.Deep we plumbed, seeking knowledge of the world. Deeper still we delved, until our fate was inevitable. Minds were shattered, my comrades ran screaming into the night. We are all lost, to that terrible Thing...Now, the malformed syzygy beckons. Complete the ritual and bring about the end."
7304,"WANTED: Dark Chronicler : Champion wanted for an expedition into the depths of Xibala. Strange noises and wails come from the bones at night and our workers are terrified. Seek out the source of the strange noises and destroy it, and a reward will be yours."
7305,"Zoram'gar Outpost : Saurfang shall establish our troops here, now that Astranaar is ours. I shall continue my hunt for the only creature that can stop our march to victory: Malfurion Stormrage.  Our next order of business will be to establish a foothold at the base of Darkshore. Commander Grimfang of the Zoram'gar Outpost should be able to accommodate an incoming army.  Inform him of our arrival and ensure the necessary preparations are made."
7306,Waking a Dreamer : This should be all I need to call upon the Ancient.  Some unwanted visitors may answer the call first. Protect me as I perform the ritual!
7307,A Child of Pa'ku : <The pterrordax egg is warm and trembling. It will hatch soon.>  Perhaps a certain pterrordax loa can help you.
7308,"Sanctuary Under Siege : I fear that Emperor Korthek was not lying when he boasted of his foolish plan.  If General Jakra'zet attacked the Sanctuary of the Devoted while we were away, there is a good chance that he now has everything needed to resurrect Mythrax.  We must hurry to the Sanctuary and stop Jakra'zet. Mythrax must not be reborn!"
7309,"Old Colleagues : The people in charge of those two ships are old colleagues of mine, <name>.  They did not achieve their rank through hard work as I did, but rather through deception and blackmail.  I think they deserve the hammer of karma. Or whatever weapon you prefer."
7310,"Drustvar Ho! : Azerite's in the air, <name>. Can ya smell it?  Drustvar--way over in Kul Tiras--apparently has a real big seam o' Azerite beneath it. Azerite means profit, and profit means winning this war against the Alliance... which means even more profit.  We gotta get that Azerite!  Check in with Eitrigg an' Tattersail so we can get going soon. Time is money!"
7311,"Ready to Rumble : We're going to need a new Sixteen-Servo-Actuator if we're going to fix the controls on this thing.  Bondo's gang at the yard probably has one, but they usually aren't too helpful.  Talk to Bondo, see if you can get us one."
7312,"Into Darkness : I didn't think you would find a way. Though at this point, I guess I shouldn't be surprised when you accomplish what seems impossible.  I guess all that is left is to brave the Crimson Forest and see if this thing works.  First, however, Katherine has ordered me to send word when you have found a way to Jaina. You can use one of our falcons to take a message to her."
7313,"A One-Way Ticket to the Heart : These titan facilities never cease tae amaze me. I can only imagine how many of their secrets Brann has yet tae uncover.  I just hope that one o' them holds the answer tae saving Azeroth.  It's time tae bring MOTHER tae the Chamber of Heart. Be prepared for anythin', champion. Ye can never be quite sure what will happen when ye activate a titan machine."
7314,Time for War : You should return to Commander Wyrmbane to begin working with the 7th Legion.
7315,Hot Pursuit : Priscilla's escaping on horseback! Grab one of our chargers and chase her down!
7316,Recyclable Parts : <This bundle of recycling could be valuable. The gnomes in the area appear to be dropping their scrap into some nearby contraptions.>
7317,"Sampling the Goods : Bridgeport is a major trade hub for this area. Naturally, Ashvane has offices and workshops here.  Check around town and see if you can learn anything about this new material and how they're using it.  If you can lift a sample for us to send back to Boralus, even better.  I gotta stay here and keep an eye on someone."
7318,A Safer Place : <The murloc seems to be in rough shape. Perhaps it would be safer with your allies in Mezzamere.>
7319,"Charming the Lifeless : <You've seen a charm like this in Fallhaven being used to control a wicker construct.  If you can figure out how to use it, you may be able to take control of one of the coven's wicker constructs.>"
7320,Cease Fire! : The enemy has turned our forward cannons around on us.  Scuttle that equipment to stop the bombardments!
7321,"Mission from the King : Och, good ta see ya! Feels great ta stretch me gryphon's wings above the seas.  I'm here ta assist with the war effort. Happy to help!  Let's go meet with Master Shaw, matey.  Ha! Always wanted to say somethin' piratey. Did ya know they named a ship after me once? It was wild!"
7322,Zul's Mutiny : A ship such as Rastakhan's Might does not readily sail without her crew.  Dat means de Zandalari aboard have succumbed to Zul's machinations and have betrayed their king as surely as he has.  Board my ship. Kill those who think to rise against their king. We will take no prisoners.  De punishment for de crime of mutiny is death!
7323,"WANTED: Ten'gor and Nol'ixwan : To any hunters worthy of the challenge: Find and defeat the dueling giant direhorn and devilsaur, named Nol'ixwan and Ten'gor. Their never-ending battle has disrupted travel throughout Zuldazar. Glory for any that succeed!"
7324,"Informing the Horde : General Jakra'zet has been defeated, but his plan to summon Mythrax succeeded despite our best efforts.  Were it not for the mercy of Sethraliss, I doubt we would have made it out of Atul'Aman alive.  We must inform our allies of what has transpired in Vol'dun.  I'll speak with princess Talanji myself. You should go and speak with the Horde. We need all the help we can get now.  I'm sure our paths will cross again, <name>. It was an honor fighting with you."
7325,"A Weapon of Old : I've been studying the parchment Lady Lucille sent with you and have translated some of the older language.   They called it ""Liquid Fire"" and it was used to ""burn away the Drust"". Using this as a basis I believe we can adapt it to our needs. This is a complex recipe, but it just so happens I have everything we need to make this potent alchemical weapon!  I will need your assistance in creating this. Would you be so kind as to help?"
7326,
7327,"Upgraded : Well, look at you, <race>...  <Christy's mechanical eyes quickly scan your body.>  Not as impressive as I had hoped.  King Mechagon's armies are fully mechanized. But, you... you have a severe excess of flesh and matching machinery deficiency.  Yes, we simply must make a few changes... Maybe a neural-cranial upgrade!  Bring me a few microcogs from the motospiders nearby and I'll fix you up!"
7328,"Aerial Aspirations : <Kua'fon studies you intensely. One single golden eye is trained on you, unwavering.>  Skree.  <He then turns his maw toward the horizon and spreads his wings wide.>  Skree!  <Is it finally time?>"
7329,"Bumbles the Bee : Hey $p, thanks for delivering Mom's letter. I was really starting to worry about her!  Dad and I have been having a few problems running the farm after she left on her trip. If you didn't show up when you did, we'd still be in real trouble!  I was hoping you would be willing to help Bumbles out too. He was hurt when his hive was destoyed.  If we feed him some of Dad's special formula, hopefully he will heal up faster. First we need to find the secret ingredient, try looking around at his other lab."
7330,"The Wounded King : I have things under control here... for now, at any rate.  If we want to salvage this situation, Rastakhan must survive. Habutu is gone, but his other guardian, Zolani, has sent word.  She is protecting the King at a small fishing village called Zeb'ahari. Find Zolani and do what you can to ensure Rastakhan lives.  Be careful, <name>."
7331,"Drill Rig Construction : <Prince Erazmin sifts through the resources you both collected.>  Yes... This appears to be sufficient material to repair that drill rig.  I'll do what I can with the parts that I have, but you will need to complete the repairs with yours.  When you're ready, return to that broken drill rig we found and open it up.  Together, we'll have it up and running in no time."
7332,Dueler's Guild : I figured a war-torn <race> such as your self would benefit from training in the Dueler's Guild.  Speak with a nearby bouncer to participate in the carnage.
7333,"Battered Twilight Scale : <The worn scale of a twilight dragon, it has seen many years of fighting.  The twilight dragons were thought to have been defeated with the fall of Sinestra, how were there so many on the island?  And who is leading the flight?>"
7334,Worldvein Rumors : Gather more intelligence to assist your followers in tracking down the location of the Fluctuating Worldvein.
7335,"Rescuing the Resistance : King Mechagon is ruthlessly efficient. He only expends resources to kidnap those he deems worthy.  The rest, he... discards.  <Prince Erazmin grimaces.>  We will deal with my father, King Mechagon, another day.  This information is more immediately relevant in that my father's predictability means our top scientists, engineers, and tinkerers should all be trapped, alive, somewhere in this depot.  We will find them, and break them out."
7336,"Reinforcements : The resources you gather can be used to recruit new troops for the war effort.  Return to me periodically to issue new recruitment orders for your missions.  If you have available resources, you should use them now to issue your first recruitment order.  The war effort rages on even as we speak. We have need of fresh recruits."
7337,"Return of the Warrior King : Ye've done a great deal fer Azeroth, hero, but unfortunately I'm gonna have tae ask ye tae do more. N'Zoth is on the loose, an there's no tellin' when or where he'll strike.  This battle is one ye can't face alone. When the time comes, ye'll have my hammer at yer side!  But first, we'll need tae fetch it."
7338,"Requisition: A Few Carp : Our local sea life is in danger! If you spot a fish out of water, please return it to the nearest lake, stream, or river. Conservation is everyone's responsibility!"
7339,"Ring of the Reefs : <A light mist twists and curls around this ring as if caressing it.  Holding this object makes you uneasy, deep within your soul. It feels as if invisible, icy hands from the lands of the dead are pulling at you.  There is no mistaking Helya's power.  The Valarjar will want to hear about this.>"
7340,"The Art of Taming : I'm quite surprised to find this beast still alive and kicking. It appears to like you.  Before we finish, you had better learn how to wrangle multiple pets.  I'll give you one last lesson."
7341,Daughter of the Sea : They're not letting us any closer to the keep. We'll have to walk from here.  Returning to Boralus has stirred feelings I thought I'd left behind. Memories smoothed away by the years like stones in the tide.  It all feels raw again.  I do not know how this will end--only that we must try.
7342,Paint Vial: Lemonade Steel : <Marvelous Martini could make use of this item.>
7343,"The Fall of the Sunwell : The flame of the lantern dims. Your final task is to rekindle it.  In order to do so, you must walk one remaining path. While we are fortunate to hold the Sunwell once again, we must always remember that it was yet another part of us that Arthas took away... and that our late prince was forced to find us a new way of life.  Enter the Sunwell Plateau, and witness its fall."
7344,"Icetusk Fur Cloak : <The fur on this cloak is worn and tattered, but it is still warm. It has seen many years in the harsh, unforgiving blizzards of the north.  The icetusk tribe has not been seen on Azeroth until now, someone in Northrend might know more about them.>"
7345,
7346,"Foothold: Drustvar : It seems Drustvar has a big seam of Azerite underground.  Do you like profit? I LOVE profit. This seems like a golden opportunity, if ya catch my meanin'. Time is money!            - Trade Prince Gallywix"
7347,"Dominating the Indomitable : With the wounds healed, I can clearly sense the dragon essence. Unfortunately, it seems to emanate from the earthen giant before us.  I will address the creature. Let us hope it listens to reason... but be prepared for anything.  When Deathwing shattered the World Pillar in Deepholm, he earned the ire of the Stonemother and her forces. I fear this being may blame me for my father's crimes."
7348,"The Zanchuli Council : You there, Speaker of de Horde.My spies have told me of dark heresies being practiced in our sacred temple of Zanchul.De king sent Loti and Raal to deal with de situation, but those two bickering council members are soft on their own followers.We need someone more... ruthlessly neutral.Go meet Wardruid Loti down at de Zocalo and she can tell you de rest."
7349,"Fate's End : Fate's End is a place in turmoil. The seas froth, the air cracks with thunder. We tried to settle there once, but each settlement disappeared into the mists, every soul never to be seen again. The island did not want inhabitants.  Now we send our most vile exiles there. They never return and no one knows why.  Should we find and recover Jaina, she will be the first. I hope we are not too late."
7350,"Freshly Squeezed : Is this troll a friend of yours? I'm so glad Kiro let me keep her.   He's a bit wary of outsiders, but he's a great healer.   She'll wake up, I promise. And when she does, she'll be thirsty.  The sands are short on water, but you're in luck. The grove that surrounds this camp is filled with pricklevines.   You wouldn't want to eat the flesh, but the liquid inside can quench any thirst.  Just give them a good squeeze to collect their juice."
7351,"The Final Act : Those of us with enough mechanization survived, but it didn't matter. Bondo Bigblock sold us out. In exchange for full mechanization, he built giant bots and attacked Rustbolt.   He will continue to act against us, till those few of us left are dead.   We must remove this threat immediately."
7352,"To Darkmaul Citadel : We've rescued everyone except for the expedition's captain. Lindie's Scout-o-Matic spotted her just outside Darkmaul Citadel.  Meredy has come up with an... interesting plan to rescue the captain. It may be our only chance.  Come. We'll convene in the shadow of Darkmaul Citadel, and there we will begin our rescue mission."
7353,"A Lost Flute : <This little flute, while dusty, appears to be well cared for.  Its owner can't be too far away.>"
7354,"A Reason to Stay : <You find a pocketwatch on the ground. It is dirty, but still works. It was taken care of well.Perhaps there are other objects that Goldfield wasn't able to grab before he had to hole up in his house. He might appreciate it if you brought them to him.>"
7355,"Profit and Reconnaissance : This was supposed to be a covert operation. Unfortunately, our Trade Prince insisted on coming along... with the loudest, most conspicuous vehicle the Horde has ever conceived.  At least you're here with me, <name>.  Let's get going, then. We know next to nothing about the Drustvar territory. It's time to do some recon."
7356,"The Necropolis : A deal is a deal, and I pay my debts.  Bwonsamdi is a mighty loa and you are going to need a powerful ritual to obtain his attention.  You are in luck. I already know exactly what needs to be done.  Bwonsamdi's temple, de Necropolis, is just to de north. Meet me in de courtyard and we shall see about obtaining an audience with de loa of death."
7357,"Ritual Effects : I will need some assistance in conducting the ritual to allow us to gain passage to Fate's End. To help me with that, you will require the proper items and attire.  Normally I have free access to these things, but the recent upheaval has blocked myself and many of my brothers and sisters from obtaining them easily. However, the fallen tidesages across the span have all you will need.  Collect a ritual knife, lantern and robes from the fallen and these so-called prophets."
7358,"Plot Twist : It is time to end Vol'jamba.  I want to make one thing clear. He can still kill you. Your fate, moreso than mine, hangs on your ability to fight dis former student of mine.  He will bring masks, and voodoo, and he will do everything within his power to end you. All we have done is taken away his ability to cheat.  Good luck. For your sake, I hope you do not fail."
7359,"Broken Compass : <A compass found on a stranded pirate, it no longer functions.   The metal and craftsmanship indicate an origin in Stormwind.>"
7360,"A Change in Direction : Whispers of dissent have been spreading through the harbor, <name>.  You can hear the grumblings of pirates who do not want to give up their freedom!  Rumor holds that some of the other authority figures have goals that align with mine.  I forged some letters in the captain's hand. Deliver them... see who bites.  Or who gets in our way."
7361,Bottom Feeding Stinkfish : <Danielle Anglers may be interested in this fish.>
7362,"Queenfeather : Ah, so you are de one who inherited Bazkoji's herd. What is left of it, anyway.  I know what killed him, and I tried to warn him. Queenfeather is a vicious ravasaur, bigger than de rest and smarter as well. Most of de eggs around here are hers.  Usually I praise de strength of such a beast, but she has become a nuisance.  You will find her guarding her nests in de feeding grounds. Kill her and bring back one of her head feathers as proof dat de deed is done."
7363,Nuke 'Em Norbit : These motospiders continue to multiply unchecked. If we don't slow them down they'll overrun Rustbolt soon.  I've modified Norbit here with adequate firepower to take the spiders head on!  Would you pilot Norbit and destroy the Reinforced Sparkweave Eggs?
7364,"Show Me What You've Got : It looks like you understand the basics. Now it's time to put everything together.  Head for the ring. Once you hear the starting pistol, you will have one minute to score as high as possible.  Gnolls are worth one point. Run 'em through with the harpoon!  If you see a paper zeppelin, bag it with your bolas for fifty points!  Leaping fences gives you style. Style gives you more points when you skewer gnolls or down zeppelins. It's super important, so don't forget to keep jumping fences!"
7365,The Divine's Shield : This island has been cursed by necrotic magic. The Light can only just reach this place.  Call upon its Divine Shield to step through the barrier before us unharmed and destroy this vile altar.  Show the darkness on this island that you are protected by the Light's embrace.
7366,"Trouble at Greystone Keep : A friend of mine, a fellow military courier, had a job at Greystone Keep. The fort lies just outside of Boralus, so I would've expected him to be back by now.  I have another job lined up, so could you go check out the fort for me? I'm probably just being paranoid."
7367,"Securing Warfang Hold : The Dark Lady has important work for you, <name>.  Preparations are beginning for a meeting of the Horde's leadership at Warfang Hold. I trust I don't need to emphasize that security is of the highest import for this gathering.  The goblin, Gallywix, has sent his underlings to make sure the area is swept of any... unwanted guests. I need you to make sure they succeed in their task."
7368,"Stone Soup : On the surface of the rock you find carvings of what you make out to be ingredients.If you find the ingredients, perhaps you can make the troggs' soup for yourself."
7369,"Our Direct Line : I'm sure you agree that Pascal-K1N6 is the greatest invention you've ever seen!  If you're not convinced yet, try to push him to his limits. I don't mind!  Bring him more resources and blueprints -- he'll craft anything you need!"
7370,Tea Party : I...I-I'm sorry. I... I can't... <You hear footsteps behind you.> A... Abby? Wh...
7371,"Hir'eek, the Bat Loa : Hir'eek knows we are here. If my knowledge of Hir'eek is correct, he will personally kill us after we present ourselves.  It is time, den. You and I will walk out dere into a horde of blood trolls who want to watch their loa kill us.  Take dis dagger. It is coated with de poison I made. I trust you to survive longer than me to use it.  You pretend to cower to Hir'eek, and I will do de talking. On my signal, you jump on Hir'eek and start stabbing!  ...And den we hope for de best."
7372,"A Pocketful of Shells : You see the problem? No you don't.Problem isn't all these dang quilboar. Quilboar I can shoot all day. Been shootin' em all my life, since my pappy gave me my first gun. Problem is these pigs are tough. Tougher'n they've been before. Can't kill em like I used to, see? My new modified bullets just get stuck in them and they refuse to die!Here, take my knife. Go out there and kill some of the quilboar and get my ammo back. Then I can shoot the rest! I won't stop 'till there's none left to shoot!"
7373,
7374,"Maintaining Focus : At present, the focus holds but a fraction of N'Zoth's true power. If we further empower it, we could craft even more effective weapons to wield against him.  N'Zoth's influence is everywhere, <name>, and is most concentrated within powerful foes. Vanquish them and claim whatever vestiges of the Old God's power remain."
7375,How to Kill a Dark Ranger : Let's go over the plan. We don't get many chances to kill a captain of Sylvanas's dark rangers.
7376,
7377,Steal Them Back : <This empty crate of supplies is clearly marked with Kul Tiran signage. These must be the spoils of their raids on the farms of the valley.The citizens would probably like their supplies back if there are any left.>
7378,Waste Not : <There's a variety of parts around this area that might be useful to Rustbolt. You should collect them before Venture Co takes them.>
7379,The Nuts and Bolts of It : I started working on the leg gearing. Most the gearing around here is built from spare parts we find in the scrap heaps.   We're going to need a lot of spare parts to fix this thing. See what you can find.
7380,"If Bones Could Talk : <These skeletons appear to be rising out of the ancient ruins that dot the land here. Their bones are covered with what looks like runes, but time has worn away all but fragments of the markings.  If you could find some of these runes intact, Lucille might be able to decipher them to find out where these skeletons come from...  ...and why they are no longer at rest.>"
7381,"Bridgeport Investigation : While you're in Bridgeport, you might keep an ear out for any information that will be of aid to us.  You'd be surprised what you can learn by staying quiet and listening to people who think they're alone..."
7382,"The Fury of the Horde : The Norwington Estate has a large cache of Azerite, along with the Alliance's latest Azerite weapons.  We need to steal these weapons and all of their Azerite. Every weapon stolen is a Horde life saved.  When you are ready to strike, let me know. I shall signal our warriors to begin the assault.  The Alliance and Kul Tirans will see the true might of the Horde!"
7383,Blueprint: Holographic Digitalization Relay : <This blueprint details how to build what appears to be some form of holographic teleporter.  You should be able to upload the blueprint to Pascal-K1N6's database in Rustbolt.>
7384,"It's Never Easy : The last I heard, Mogu'shan Vaults was still abandoned.   We shouldn't have too tough of a time reachin' the engine, since we've already defeated the mogu guardians in that place.  Well, what are ye waitin' for? Let's get that engine turned on!"
7385,Assault: The Warring Clans : The opportunistic mogu clans seek to take the Vale while its defenders are recovering from N'Zoth's attack.   They are both cowardly and foolish.  Show them the error of their ways.
7386,"Assault: Amathet Advance : The Amathet seek to claim the Forge of Origination for their own. We must not allow it to fall into their hands again!  Our men are defending the entrance, but they will be overwhelmed if the entire might of the Amathet advances upon them.   Do what you can to route their forces before its too late."
7387,"MOTHER Knows Best : Now that this chamber's not fallin' tae pieces anymore, we can focus on makin' the Heart stronger!  MOTHER says she's finished her fancy calculations. Have a word with her, champion. See if we can further empower the amazin' gift Azeroth gave ye."
7388,"The Lost Shaman : Pardon me, <class>. I am in need of your assistance.  Our shaman, Farseer Ori, left the camp some days ago to investigate a nearby disturbance in the elements. He took his apprentice with him, a young initiate named Odari. Neither have returned.  I am leading an expedition to find them and return them here safely. Nazjatar is full of dangers. The skills of an accomplished <class> like yourself could prove most useful.  Will you help me return the lost shaman to safety?"
7389,"Real Ultimate Power : When I say that power is life, I'm not speaking figuratively, my dear test subject.  Properly harnessed, power can create life itself--or at least a close enough facsimile for our purposes.  There is a massive reserve of discarded technology lurking deep in the mucky depths of the Outflow. As usual, Mechagon's trash is our treasure.  I've finally perfected my device that will animate the sludge to bring that technology up to the surface for you.  All you have to do is pop 'em and grab the tech!"
7390,"The Start of Something Bigger : We have coordinates locked into the gyrocopters. You and Captain Winklespring will fly the lead. If we run into any trouble, Tinkmaster Overspark wants the most experienced pilots out front.  Board whenever you are ready to go."
7391,"The Missing Handler : I just received word from Warbeast Kraal dat one of their handlers is missing.  Dis is not usually a problem, but dey are expecting a large hatching dis year. Dey will need all de hands dey can get!  Go on and see if you can find de handler, name of Bazo or something, and tell him to get back to de Kraal."
7392,"The Deadliest of Poisons : You've got the poison. Now it's time to take out that ogre. Gutgruk the Tough.  He usually patrols around their citadel. Probably looking for your expedition as we speak!  Poison your blades, then take that monster down."
7393,Blueprint: Blue Spraybot : <This blueprint details how to build what appears to be a small robot capable of showering an area in colored paint.  You should be able to upload the blueprint to Pascal-K1N6's database in Rustbolt.>
7394,"The Warchief Awaits : <name>,  There are important matters I would like to discuss with you, but discretion is of the utmost importance.   Meet me in my chambers in the Undercity where I can assure our privacy has not been compromised.   Ensure that you are not followed; Orgrimmar has become riddled with SI:7 spies. It would seem that that King Anduin and Mathias Shaw are desperate to know what our next move is. How admirable."
7395,
7396,"They Came From The Sea : You are free to rest your weary legs in our camp, but I'm afraid we have little more to offer you.  Naga have driven us from our village by the sea. We can no longer fish or hunt crabs. I fear we may not survive long if we cannot take back our lagoon.  But taking back the lagoon will not be enough. We must find out why the naga attacked us. What is it they are looking for?  Take this ancient scroll and use it summon the spirits of the naga.  They will only speak truth while under its spell."
7397,"Lovesick and Lost : Ugh. My head. My HEART.  Feels like a good hangover and a bad breakup put together.  On the bright side, I think I know where we are. And where that ship was headed.  Freehold.  It's a... free town. For, uh... free folk. The only rule is that there are no rules. Lotta guys with peg legs and eye patches and exotic pets. Catch my drift?  There's a trail through the hills that'll take us there. Pretty sure I remember the way...  Let's get moving. Gotta walk off that damn siren's witchery."
7398,Hold My Hand : Take me to my daddy this instant!  Waaaait! You have to hold my hand...
7399,"The Void Elves Stand Ready : Bal'a dash, $p. Alleria and the others have informed me of your many accomplishments here in Kul Tiras.  I'm honored to join you on this mission. As a representative for the void elves, I am eager to prove to King Anduin that his trust in us was well-placed.  Forgive me, do not allow me to delay you.  Alleria and the others can brief me on the mission as we travel. You may tell the Grand Admiral that we are ready to set sail whenever you like."
7400,"The Beauty of Marketing : While us Fizzbrackets may not be goblins, we still know a business opportunity when we see one! The resort staff is getting trained, the place is getting cleaned up, now all we need is some quality marketing!  <Wulferd holds up a familiar looking box.>  Behold! The wondrous Gnomish engineering feat that is the S.E.L.F.I.E. Camera! Now, if only there was a generous <race> willing to capture the radiance of this place.  Make sure you look like you're enjoying yourself out there!"
7401,"Crab Trapping : We are trapped here with little in the way of food and supplies.  The territorial sethrak control the land to the west, and the spiteful naga the waters to the east. We are caught between a barren desert and a hostile ocean.  If you are headed to the lagoon to face the naga, will you bring us back some crabs to eat?  I fear that our tribe will soon perish without food..."
7402,"The Curse of Fletcher's Hollow : It's obvious the constable won't be swayed until we discover what happened at Fletcher's Hollow. I know very little myself--only that the village has been overrun by monstrous creatures.  I must ask that you travel there in my stead and try to uncover what befell the village. I'm sure Marshal Reade will prevent the constable from harming me while you're away.  Do this for me, and I will help you as I can."
7403,"The Crypt Keeper : I've been keeping my sights on the cemetery.  There is one ghost that walks with a purpose, unlike the others.  He is the crypt keeper, the keeper of the keys.  If we want to get to Valentine's body, we will need to go through the ghost first."
7404,"New Allies Among Us : Even in times of peace, the Horde is not without its problems.     Although they can be overwhelming at times, our struggles should never stop us from remembering what it means to be a part of the Horde.   We don't turn people away when times get tough; we band together and endure.   For a moment I forgot this. Burdened by the troubles facing our new allies, I hastily dismissed the vulpera.   My only hope is that they still see as much value in the Horde as I see in them."
7405,
7406,"Scouting the Pens : Some of our scouts have not returned.  They have been keeping an eye on the Zanj'ir Slave Pens.   The naga there take our people. They break their minds. Our scouts watch them, and when there is a window, they rescue them.  Something is going on. We need to get them home!"
7407,"A Good Spanking : Pinky is contained in de direhorn pen for now, but de handlers are having a real hard time with him!  Dis calls for some tough love.  Will you help dem?"
7408,"Profanity Filter : I hate this place! I just want to go home, but I can't because that oaf, Shoak, is missing.  Listen, <race>t, I'll make it worth your while if you help me find that dunce.  I've got a way to find Shoak, but of COURSE these stupid totems are blocking my magic! Why wouldn't they?  Take this scroll and use its magic to burn these totems. I'm going to look around to see if that bonehead is just sleeping somewhere."
7409,"The Long Con : Hello again my young friend! I have good news.  Our mutual acquaintance Carentan -- the man who scammed us in Freehold -- has finally come out of hiding.  I have been communicating with him in letters delivered by various middlemen and even completed a few proxy trades to earn his trust. In our last correspondence, he agreed to meet for an in-person trade.  He thinks he is meeting with a Ms. Pixy Spindlespark, gnomish hairdresser with a weakness for poached furs.  But he'll be meeting you instead."

We need pay 'em what we owe 'em.  If you're not pickin' up what I'm puttin' down, I mean we need to kill that backstabbin' upstart Mogul Razdunk.  You take care of him; I'll take care of gettin' what we're owed.  I s'pose we oughta tell Blightcaller about this, huh? When he tells us what to do, just smile and nod. We'll handle it our way."
7413,A Small Team : I've determined the single attribute that is most important for a team member to survive an expedition to Mechagon.    That attribute is...being a gnome!  Gather these gnomes and meet Tinkmaster Overspark and myself at the departure point.
7414,"The High Thornspeaker : My teacher, Ulfar, the High Thornspeaker, must be informed of what's been going on here.  I can't leave just yet. There are too many wounded and we'll need to handle the last few remaining constructs.  You have proven trustworthy, friend. Take a few of these runic cores to Ulfar for me.   Arthur will meet you at the head of the path to Ulfar's den."
7415,"More Power : Welcome back, dear test subject.  My dear sister has kindly asked me to administer today's experiment, which falls below our typical standards of legality...  You may, as always, choose not to participate and we will acquire sufficient replacement test subjects.  Our new project requires more energy than our generator can manage. We must supercharge it with a jolt of power from the outside.  Bondo's Yard has the best power line in Mechagon, so we shall siphon what we need from those rapscallions."
7416,"What Rots Beneath : Good job killin' Ateena and sendin' whatever dat construct was down ta da bottom of... whatever dis ting be.

The rest of the Gob Squad are hidin' out there, waiting for word when it's safe.  Take this tracker. It'll tell ya when you're getting close to one of the squad. When you get real close, you should see 'em.  That'll tell any of the squad nearby that it's safe to come outta hidin' and come back here.  With the right goblins and parts, we'll be killing Alliance in no time!"
7418,"Blood Troll on the Outside : One of our scouts, Jo'chunga, has infiltrated de blood trolls, but we have not heard back from him.  I need your help to find Jo'chunga and see what he has discovered about de blood trolls.  If you are going to find him, you need to sneak in by looking like one of de blood troll women. Dey are de ones with de most freedom to move around. I have a ritual that can change you.  Help me set up de ritual to make you look like a blood troll."
7419,"Keep Them On Task : Princess Talanji's actions have thrown off our pursuers. Her loa is powerful indeed.  We need to be certain if there were survivors, they do not gain a foothold on Zandalar. I am concerned that our Forsaken compatriots might get... overzealous. Please keep an eye on them, and remind them of what is honorable."
7420,"Unintended Consequences : <Xal'atath speaks once more.>  The servants of N'Zoth prepare for their master's return. They intend to conjure a scouring storm to wash away all unbelievers.  The particular ritual they will invoke requires three ancient artifacts. One of void, one of storm, and one of ocean.  Even now, I hear the void relic calling to me. It is being empowered... or corrupted, I am not sure which. I see it upon a cliff, overlooking a vast sea.  Come, <class>. We can find a much better use for such a prize."
7421,"Zealots of Zalamar : We're surrounded by the enemy, <name>, and it's got me blood ragin'!  I'm fit as a fi... instrument... and ready to help get us outta this forsaken cavern.  Let's show 'em the end o' their miserable lives, eh?"
7422,"Out on a Limb : Ah, there you are.  Kua'fon ran off into de jungle. I saw him head down de western path out of the Kraal but beyond that I could not say where he may have gone.  This kind of thing happens with the young. Our winged companions have a keen sense of adventure!  It would be helpful if yours could fly, but it is not yet time. I would check any reasonably high place that he could climb to, as a start."

7428,"A Worthy Ally : Some of our bravest ankoan have volunteered to join you on your expedition.  You will find each have their own special interests and they will mark your map with different opportunities every day.  Use the Deepflame Campfire when you are ready. Choose a noble ally to join you, and explore what remains of Nazjatar.  Choose wisely! You may only select one friend per day."
7429,"Lost in Darkness : If people are being pulled somewhere else, it would explain why no one has ever returned. I also choose to believe it means Lady Jaina might be able to be saved as well.  Go back to Lady Katherine with all speed! She will want to know of this development."
7430,"Forging Onward : Thanks fer helpin' me back there at the forge. It's vexin' that N'Zoth was able to infiltrate it so quickly, but at least we arrived in time tae keep it from bein' completely wrecked!  Now comes the task of gettin' her back tae a hundred percent.

7431,
7432,"Temple of Sethraliss: Avatar of the Loa : We cannot let Mythrax bring his destruction upon this world once more.   We need our loa now more than ever, but she has yet to return to us.  The time of her rebirth has passed. Someone, or something, must be preventing her awakening.  Enter her resting place and see what you can uncover."
7433,
7434,"Razorfin Hunting Spear : <This spear is razor sharp, though it has clearly seen many years of hunting in the open sea.  The shaft has been broken in several places and repaired with what materials were available at the time. From the variety of repair materials, you surmise that the jinyu tribe you recently faced must travel extensively.  The friendly jinyu of Pandaria might know more about this strange tribe.>"
7435,"A New Dawn : House Stormsong may be lost, but this valley still holds so much hope.   Sam knew that from the beginning.  We have to continue to help the Storm's Wake in any way we can. There are still remnants of the fallen house everywhere, and whoever turned them to this darkness is out there as well.  Cyrus and the others will want to hear about everything that happened. We should tell them together."
7436,"The Ancient One : Dis is far worse than I thought. Pa'ku is crying out in my mind. Dey are doing something to her. Something old and terrible, smelling of de old ways.She is nearby, just south of here. Come, $p, meet me at Pa'ku's roost and we'll rescue her."
7437,"Staying Hidden : Dere be trouble brewin', mon. Da blood trolls be on da move! Dey set up a large camp nearby and have been sending a small force to da isle south of here.   If dey discover our position while we be havin' no defenses, it gonna be game over! We need ta see what dey be up to and get rid of dem.  Our best bet be ta investigate da isle south a here. Ya want ta join me? I be ready ta head out."
7438,"Payment in Kind : <name>, King Anduin has requested our presence in Stormwind.  We've sent him reports on our situation here in Nazjatar, and he understands the severity of the threat we're facing. For him to pull both of us back from the front lines, it must be a matter of grave importance.  I will meet you in Stormwind Keep."
7439,"Deep Dive : We need you to retrieve Marshal M. Valentine's body at the ocean floor below.  I should warn you: this part of the ocean is going to be very deep, and very dark, and very cold.  Speak with Hobart at the starboard side of the ship. He's brought all the machinery you'll need to get to the ocean floor."
7440,"Dream Catcher : It appears that the focus remains stable, and its containment field remains intact. I daresay we can empower it even further.  Hunt down and defeat formidable enemies to acquire additional remnants of N'Zoth's influence. This time, we will infuse the focus with even greater amounts of the Old God's power. I am confident that the containment field will continue to hold."
7441,"The Lady's Fate : Meredith never joined the ceremony. She might be in trouble!  Lucy is in shock, and I cannot leave her here. You must go in my stead to the tower, and ensure the safety of your Lady.  Do this for me, and you will be rewarded."

7443,
7444,Assault: Aqir Unearthed : Our position is being overrun. The aqir are surging in greater numbers than I've ever seen!  I'm not sure how long we'll be able to hold the line. We need you to drive them back!

For a brief moment after the battle with G'huun, the spirit of our old warchief, Vol'jin, appeared in view of all in Zuldazar.I had a hundred questions to ask my old friend, but his spirit faded before I could muster my voice.I have asked Talanji to perform her seance once more, so that I might speak with the spirit of Vol'jin.Will you collect the Glaive of Vol'jin from its resting place at the base of the pyramid and then join us at Zanchul?"
7447,"This is Huge! : $p, allow me to introduce Megs and Morton, the gnomes who are going to shake things up for the Alliance in a big way!  They've been perfecting a device that can take any ordinary animal and turn it into a humongous, unstoppable beast that we can then unleash on our enemies!  I'll let Megs and Morton fill you in on the specifics, but I promise you, this tech is a game changer!"
7448,"Message from the Management : <This letter from Priscilla Ashvane to her employees appears to be posted all over the foundry.  It sounds like Cagney's information was accurate, Ashvane is working their people around the clock.  Priscilla mentions a Forgemaster Farthing and a Taskmaster Williams. They may have more information about her plans.>"
7449,Zuldazar : King Rastakhan is an ancient ruler who is not quick to trust new allies. We must earn his trust if we are to earn his fleet.  Zuldazar is the seat of power for the Zandalar empire and a good place to start in winning over these potential allies.
7450,"Trust of a King : Well, now dat you are settled in, you had best go speak with my father. You can find him up upon de throne, his advisors close at hand, pouring poison in his ear, no doubt.  De lift behind you can take you to de Golden Throne above us."
7451,
7452,"You Must be This Height : The moment is here <name>.   For such a historic moment I feel a gnome, such as myself, should be the one to activate the device.  Let me know when you think we should begin."
7453,Stopping the Sappers : The ice should keep the Horde out while we handle the sapper teams gathered on the beach.  I'm going to keep those Horde galleons busy. I need you to handle whoever is in charge and bring all the Azerite bombs you find back to me.  Then we'll handle disposing of their weapons.
7454,The Orphaned Hatchling : <The surviving hatchling bleats piteously as it gazes at its mother's corpse.  It inspects you hopefully and seems to want to follow you.  Perhaps you can find someone in Warbeast Kraal who can care for it?>
7455,"The Missing Crew : I can't believe it. Almost the entire fleet.. lost!   We need to have ships out there on missions supporting our efforts, but how am I supposed to do that now?  If we are going to recover from this, I'm going to need my top people. I know the chances are low, but I need you to get out there and try to find them. Alive if possible."
7456,"Playing to Their Strengths : Iltheux isn't properly utilizing the help he's been given.  Let's fix that.  Assign new roles to the workers, ones more suited to their strengths.  If you need suggestions, I'm happy to help."
7457,"A Way Out : My spies report that our High Overlord did not leave the way he entered, nor any other way we know of. No signs of him were seen at any of the known exits from the Stockades or the sewers. He simply was in his cell one moment, and gone the next.  Begin your investigation around the city of Stormwind. There must be another way out that we do not know of.  Dark Ranger Lyana will meet you there. Her tracking skills are second to none.  Do not fail me, my champion."
7458,Blueprint: Rustbolt Requisitions : <This blueprint details how to build what appears to be a military-grade supply cache with the Rustbolt Resistance insignia on it.  You should be able to upload the blueprint to Pascal-K1N6's database in Rustbolt.>
7459,"An Improvised Arsenal : I don't know much about blacksmithing, but I'm pretty sure this won't be enough silver to outfit all of the Inquisitors.  We will need to find another way to use this.  Let us hope that Ballaster can come up with something... creative."
7460,"Preparing for the Fall : <A large quantity of supplies are scattered throughout the temple grounds, much of it under heavy guard. The Jambani appear to be preparing for a siege or another significant event.  Zul would likely think it wise to stymie their efforts.>"

They are in great danger, and we cannot allow them to stay in harm's way.We must get them to safety!"
7466,"Lucky Charm : My daddy would never admit it, but he's really superstitious. I don't think he'll ever feel safe on a horse unless he has a lucky charm!I heard about a fox somewhere around here that's been eating a lot of chickens, and escaping everybody trying to catch him. I bet he's really lucky! Maybe if you got his tail and gave it to my dad, he'd feel lucky too!"
7467,"Bloodwake Drinking Horn : <A large drinking horn taken from one of the Bloodwake vrykul.  The sturdy craftsmanship has allowed it to survive many years of hard travel on the Great Sea.  As you hold the horn, you remember how fervently the vrykul you encountered were after the Azerite, but to what end?  Other vrykul tribes may know more about the Bloodwake and their motivations.>"
7468,"Bombs, Away : By the sea's foamy beard, what a blast!They've brought goblins, and if there's one thing I know about goblins it's that they like to blow things up.I saw a few of them carrying large bombs, and I presume that they are going to blow up the town. I would like to keep the town, so how about you head out there and steal as many of those explosives as you can find? After that, let's blow up their demolishers and stop this infernal bombardment!"
7469,"Reconstructing ""The Curse of Stone"" : Thus far, the contents of this book are unsettling to say the least. Nevertheless, I have been able to glean valuable information on the nature of N'Zoth's power, and have made alterations to your cloak accordingly.  There remains much to learn, however. Continue your search for additional pages as you delve into the visions."
7470,"First One's Free : The pocket-sized computational device can accept punch cards to upgrade and modify its performance.  I could give you a punch card, but a particularly crafty trogg, Moch'k Eight-Thumbs, stole my satchel full of cards.

7471,
7472,"Mission from the Warchief : Lady Sylvanas issued orders for Garona Halforcen to take on a task of great import.  She will orchestrate missions from the Banshee's Wail, and is to assemble a strong force to execute on our plans.

7473,
7474,"Do Your Part : The b-b-barber shop? I'm sorry, what? You want to know where the barber shop is?  I'm sorry <race>, do you know there is a W-A-R going on right now?  Speaking of which, what have you done for the Alliance lately? Get out there and slay some Horde, or I'll shave your head myself."
7475,"Arrogance of Vol'jamba : Vol'jamba thinks his Sight has surpassed mine. I warned against such arrogance many years ago, but we see how well he listened.  <Zul chuckles.>  No doubt he will attempt to deter us as we encroach upon his sanctum. Listen if you like, but remember dat he is desperate to save himself. His truth is distorted by fear.  Destroy his masks and we will walk unharmed through dis passage."
7476,"A Powerful Prisoner : It appears the Faithless broke through our defenses while I was away.   They must be after Vorrik's key. It's the only reason they would have taken him alive.   Please, <name>. You must secure our leader's safe return."

They plague my dreams, their whispers are maddening. They speak of their master, clawing at the barrier...Search the cliffs for their warrens. Find what lurks within and obliterate them all."
7478,Implements of Ill Intent : <It looks like some careless witch made a poor attempt to hide this grimoire from sight. No good could come of leaving the possessions of the coven for a hapless villager to find.  It would probably be a good idea to destroy any trappings of the coven that you find in Arom's Stand.>
7479,
7480,"Spy Games : The Alliance must've got wind of this meeting and they've sent SI:7 spies to try to listen in.  The problem is, they're using some kind of gnomish tech to sneak past our detectors. One of our techs was able to put together something that should be able to neutralize whatever they're using, but the range is short.   I'll need you to take it out into the field and look for evidence of SI:7 activity. Just mash the button on that thing when you think they're close, and it should zap 'em back into view."
7481,"Numbing the Pain : The medics here are doing their best, but they've suffered heavy casualties and are strapped for healing supplies.  With a few clumps of evermoss I could mix a painkilling tincture to ease the suffering of the injured. Can you forage some from the nearby trees?  I'll help get Flynn stabilized. The last thing these people need is another wounded man howling in pain."
7482,"Looking Inside : This vault screams of ancient gnomish tech! I believe this could be the key that leads us to King Mechagon!  I can't risk putting myself in danger though, so you will lead the way into the vault.   Well, what are we waiting for? Let's see what's inside!"

7485,"Bearers of Bad News : We must report this attack to Lord Admiral Katherine Proudmoore and prove to her that Lady Ashvane is behind it.  It won't be easy... Lady Ashvane and Katherine Proudmoore have been close friends for years.  Quickly, let us make for Boralus!"
7486,"A Dark, Glaring Reality : Their eyes are upon us, <name>, watching every move from the shadows. It is no wonder our efforts thus far have felt... lacking.  The fault is by no means your own. We should have suspected this was the case long ago.  If we are to continue our efforts with meaningful expectations we must go undetected.  Our old friend has offered an elixir to aide in exposing our enemy. While there may be a few... unknown side effects, the result provides the imbiber true sight in the darkness."
7487,Paint Vial: Mechagon Gold : <Marvelous Martini could make use of this item.>
7488,"The Resistance Needs YOU! : Rustbolt isn't usually in this level of malfunction.  King Mechagon attacked our town last night. His mechanical armies captured many members of the Rustbolt Resistance and destroyed as much as they could before we drove them out.  The prisoners are being processed at Junkwatt Depot. After that, they'll be transferred down into King Mechagon's underground city... for full mechanization.  We can't let that happen. Will you help me rescue them?"
7489,"Needs a Little Body : I am here primarily to deal with my wayward student. His followers, however, I will leave to you.  I have seen a possible future dat is... concerning. Rivers running red with poison, dead filling de streets. And dese... ""Jambani"" asserting themselves as de new rulers of Zuldazar. Dis cannot come to pass.  Fortunately for you, I know how to avoid dat fate. I think you will find their cauldrons are missing one key ingredient.  <He stares at you.>  Something to give it a little body, perhaps?"
7490,"A Marine Out of Water : A giant one of those stone creatures killed quite a few marines while we were trying to evacuate the cave. It didn't chase us too far, but ignoring it outright is too big of a risk.  It needs to fall!"
7491,
7492,"The Tide Turns : The time to strike is now. We must take the Tidestone of Golganneth and the Javelin of Suramar is our best chance of piercing the barrier around it.Every minute we wait is another minute when the sea can come crashing down on us. What forces we have will be arrayed below, just outside their encampment.We will need your strength in addition to the Javelin, <name>. We do not have enough forces to take it on our own."
7493,"Build A Bigger Fish Trap : With those minnows and some spare parts, you should be able to build a Hundred-Fathom Lure.  Visit Pascal-K1N6 in Rustbolt and build one.  Then come back here, and we'll catch a huge fish!"
7494,"A Gathering of Foes : Before I was distracted, I was able to find out more about this Horde gathering. Sylvanas has summoned the leaders of the Horde and its allies. For what purpose, I cannot say.  We aren't in a position to strike her down--she is too well-protected. But perhaps we can learn something that will prove useful in the ongoing war.  Keep your head low and take a look. I'll keep an eye out for more guards."
7495,"Cleaning Out the Estate : We must keep moving forward. Our goal is to weaken the Alliance, destroy their weapons, and steal their Azerite.  The three of us will carve a path of destruction through our enemies. Let us go!"
7496,"Dire Situation : Good news, we found de source of de corruption.De bad news, it is a ritual on de apex of Zanchul.Blood magic wielding heretics are empowering some sort of dire troll up dere.How it made it all de way to de apex without us catching it is something I am sure Raal and I will be arguing about for de next year.Come, let us stop dis heresy."
7497,"Rescuing the Taken : We are doing our best to contain de fighting in Zanchul and not let it spill out into de other terraces, but we can't hold for long.If you are going to help, start by freeing Wardruid Loti. Dey are trying to break her on de platform above with a dark ritual.Her soul is bound to a fetish. You must find dat fetish if you are going to free her."
7498,"The Shadow of Death : We have four loa, but we only know where one is: Bwonsamdi.  As uncomfortable as it makes me, I am prepared to do anything to stop de blood trolls... even if it means dealing with de loa of death.  Ages ago, Bwonsamdi had a temple here in Nazmir. My scrying has revealed a few locations to de north where I sense a magical presence. Search dem for clues.  Hurry, <name>. Zuldazar will fall if we cannot obtain Bwonsamdi's help!"
7499,Heroic Warfront: The Battle for Darkshore : Darkshore belongs to the Horde! We must hold that ground to maintain our dominance over Kalimdor.  Prepare yourselves. Battle awaits!
7500,"An Abyssal Opportunity : I believe, <name>, we can use this thing to make our armor stronger. By redirecting its power, we can take the strength of our crafts to a new level.But we're getting ahead of ourselves. The first thing we need to do is repair this device.It'll require some powerful materials to fix it, and those are usually carried by the stronger creatures of this region.However, Finder Pruc is great at collecting materials like the ones we need. I'd check with him to see what he's got."
7501,"The Azsharan Medallion : <On the naga's body you find an ornate metal disc. The writing on its surface resembles elven script, but you cannot decipher it. You suspect the words are written in the Nazja tongue.  Perhaps someone with a knowledge of naga artifacts could translate the text.>"

7503,"The Bargain is Struck : Now dat you have declared a patron loa for your time here in Zuldazar, you should inform de king of your decision.He will appreciate dat you chose to follow de great Pa'ku."
7504,"Atal'Dazar: Yazma the Fallen Priestess : Zul knows dat we cannot let de first king rise from his grave. Dazar would be more than a figure head for Zul's dream troll empire, he would be a force dat could rival de very loa.  But I cannot just let Zul get away. I and mine will follow Zul, but I want you and yours to enter Atal'Dazar. Yazma is trying to buy time and keep de tombs sealed away. You will need to fight your way through to her and you will need some allies to do so. Slay her."
7505,"A Disturbance Beneath the Earth : Manifestation of dragon essence detected. Location: Highmountain.   Assuming successful retrieval, calculations indicate 92.7 percent probability of empowering Heart of Azeroth.  Theory: By combining dragon essence with sufficient quantities of Azerite within Heart Forge, previously undiscovered abilities may manifest within Heart.  As Speaker Magni would say: ""Get to work, champion."""
7506,"The Tempest Crown : <Xal'atath breathes in deeply and smiles.>  My strength grows. I can see it clearly now... the third relic we seek. The crown known as Tempest Caller.  How fitting that after the fall of Atal'Gral, the gluttonous Toatana would be the one to find the artifact. He was always scuttling about the depths, seeking treasures for his collection.  Toatana's greed has left him trapped within a cave he can never leave. The crown awaits us there."
7507,"What Will It Lure? : <Putrid and pungent, this lump of bait is the preferred food of skittering eels. Perhaps you can find infested waters nearby?>"
7508,"Catching Up : Good to see you in one piece, <name>. Nazmir is a place of nightmares, but you seem to be surviving.  Rokhan and I convinced your Horde dat we need more support. He is getting ready to meet with reinforcements.  We still need to get de loa's aid. What happened with Bwonsamdi and Hir'eek?"
7509,"Make Our Case : Katherine has trusted Priscilla Ashvane as an advisor and a close friend for many years, even before they both lost their husbands at Theramore.  She's heard the rumors about Ashvane, just like anyone. Whether by fear or loyalty, she's chosen to ignore them.  It's time to finally open her eyes."
7510,"Beauty in the Deeps : We have slain many enemies, spilled much blood on the sand. My skills have improved tenfold fighting at your side.  Yet let us not forget that once, this was a place of peace. Once, my people walked amongst the caverns and reefs undisturbed.  There is beauty, here, in the depths, all around us. Take a moment, sit, and enjoy your serene surroundings. Look here, a crab with a shell of brilliant colors.  You see? There is beauty here, even now."
7511,"In Darkest Night : <name>, I will not mince words. Tyrande foolishly risks her life with the ritual she intends to perform. If she falls, our entire war effort will fall with her.  We must set off for Darkshore and come to her aid. Only then can we march forward and reclaim our homeland.  We have lost Teldrassil. Fool or not, our people cannot afford to lose Tyrande as well."
7512,"Rumors of Exile : Talanji sent you, didn't she?   De princess needs to know dat it is no longer safe to ask such questions so openly.   Warguard Rakera spoke out, and no one has heard from her since.   Rumor has it she was exiled to Vol'dun."
7513,"Send the Signal! : My crew is not on board with de word of Zul. We saw too much of who he really is.   Far out in de harbor, Zul's traitors have joined with de mogu to try to take my ships! If we lose de fleet and de harbor, we lose de city!  We must let Zuldazar know we stand strong. We take back de ships. We drive de villains out.   You must light de towers with loa-blessed flame. Dey will always see dat de Bay of Kings belongs to Zandalar!"
7514,"Investigating the Halls : Whatever's happenin' has tae be comin' from deep within the inner chamber. If we can get tae the forge maybe we'll find some answers.  Best check yer gear 'fore headin' in, <name>. Who knows what's waitin' fer us in there."
7515,"The Fall of Corlain : <This discarded journal looks like it belonged to one of the residents of upper Corlain. Within it details some early signs of the Heartsbane's appearance in Corlain.  If you can find more writings like this, you might be able to piece together the events that led to Corlain's current state.>"
7516,"Comb the Desert : It's time to mobilize, then.  I'll stick with you, <name>. Keep an eye out for Horde activity."
7517,"My Chickens are Not for Eating! : If you've spent any time with that arrogant nitwit, Overspark, you know why I'm here.  To silence his boasting and finally prove that my inventions are better!  I've released countless mechanical chickens across this island to analyze the technology here, adopt it, and evolve their own circuitry. One of them will become my ultimate battle chicken!  But those idiot troggs think my chickens are edible and keep bashing them.  Protect them, so my techno-evolutionary experiment can run its course."
7518,"Rodrigo's Revenge : The loud men are mean, but you seem nice!  Want to have fun fun?  The pretties love my special biscuits, but it makes them full full. Then they have to... go. You know?  Let's prank the mean men! Fly fly on the pretties and make them go."
7519,"The Lost Spirit : It high time you an' I had a talk about ol' Vol'jin's missin' spirit.   Dis goes beyond simple bargains and rights of passage. Spirits don' just go missin'.  You gotta few friends dat are gonna help ya track Vol'jin's spirit down. Dem who was friends to him in life should have da strength to find him in death. And if not, Talanji gonna help ya.    Go to Talanji's ship in da Port of Zandalar. It be dat banged up ship ya came in on. You gonna do a little seance."
7520,"An End to Beginnings : We're done here. Let's return to Orgrimmar.  When you're ready, hop on one of the wyverns.   It's time to go home."
7521,"They Have Alpacas Here : Did you see? Did you see them? The floofy alpacas?!  I'VE ALWAYS WANTED A... I mean, ahh, ahem! I would like to acquire an alpaca. To study. For scientific reasons. Nothing to do with floofiness at all.  Here, this should help you wrangle one back here."
7522,"Infiltrating the Empire : The heart of the Faithless empire rests just beyond this ridge. We will need to move swiftly and quietly to avoid detection once inside.  Thankfully, my former dwelling is nearby. I know a passage that should allow us to advance into the fortress with minimal resistance. When you are ready, speak with me and I will show you the way.  <Vorrik looks around suspiciously.>  I expected the Faithless to patrol this area... Keep your eyes open for anything suspicious along the path."
7523,"The Re-Deather : I got the perfect plan. You're gonna ride the Choppy Booster Mk. 5 and BLAST those walkin' cadavers from the sky!  I hereby dub the Re-Sizer the ""Re-Deather."" We're gonna show them where the undead belong!  Er, except for OUR undead. They're totally fine.  Anyway, hop on the Choppy Booster Mk. 5 and I'll pilot it.  Once we save Shuja Grimaxe, we'll blast our way to all the other survivors!"
7524,"Deeper Into the Darkness : This recent change of events allows us to continue our journey to discover what darkness lies beyond the sands.  It will not be easy, <name>. We stand on the precipice of the unknown, but now the tables have turned.  <Wrathion glances at your new attire.>  You do dress the part.   Let's see what insights your return to the Halls of Origination bring to light."
7525,"Reconstructing ""Fear and Flesh"" : Adherents of the Old Gods maintain that flesh is a gift, not a curse. This tome reflects on the Old Gods' supposed benevolence in granting us such a generous blessing.  Naturally, it omits any mention of what occurs when their corruption is allowed to run unfettered.  Gather more of these pages for me. As wretched as these words might be, studying them will allow us to increase the efficacy of your cloak."
7526,"The Quickcharge Contract : Wondrous news, dear test subject!  My dear brother and I have restored 65% of the functionality of our research laboratory.  We are hoping to resume our regular research schedule shortly, but require a fresh batch of brave test subjects to help us push the laws of nature and science to their limits!  If you're interested, you'll just need to agree to our standard verbal contract first..."
7527,"Beginner Equitation : You may know how to ride already, but you don't know how to ride like a Kul Tiran!We'll let you borrow a horse for the festivities. Take one of our lesson masters, Cooper. He's trained many a beginner in his day!Mount up, get in the ring, and show us what you've got! I'm sure you'll be a quick learner!"
7528,"Everburning : My people have suffered loss and pain, struggling in the darkness that covered Drustvar. But now we have some light back. We have the means and the will to reclaim our lands from the lingering evils. Your help has brought much of that about.  I will miss my parents. Though their end was dark, they were family. But my duty as the head of House Waycrest is clear. The dead can handle themselves. I must attend to the living and lead.  There is a short ceremony I need to conduct. Would you assist me?"
7529,"Dousing the Flames : The Horde have set fire to my town, <class>. I will make them pay for this.Stormsong Valley is the breadbasket of Kul Tiras, and our people need to be fed. The first thing we must do is damage control.Grab some buckets and help put those fires out!"
7530,"Justice for the Fallen : Justice for da sons and daughters of lost loa. Justice for da heart of Zandalar. G'huun must be slain, and a symbol of his death displayed to those who need see it most.Take me glaive, drive it into da corpse of dat beast, and let Talanji show it to her people.Let peace be started in da hearts of da Zandalari."
7531,"Headhunter Jo : He said he's hunting you. I'm not the prey, I'm the bait!Behind ye!"
7532,"What Will It Mine? : <Although worn from repeated use, the pickaxe still seems salvageable. Perhaps there's something nearby that can be mined?>"
7533,"We've Got Crabs! : <name>, you're just in time. Everything's ready for the crab hunt!  Okay, okay... I know what you're thinking. A founding member of D.E.H.T.A. that condones hunting?  I'm going to level with you, <name>. I've got a bar full of hungry murlocs that only eat three things: crabs, fish, and people.  If that's not reason enough, crabs are overpopulated in this region and they're decimating the local grub worm population!  How many innocent grub worms need to die before we do something, <name>?"
7534,"The High Life : You there, I require some help.  Everyone where I once called home lost their lives to the flood. I still don't know what became of my father, Corin.   It pains me to return to the estates, and there are vengeful spirits who haunt the once pristine grounds. Will you help me find out what happened to my father?"
7535,
7536,"House of the King : I hear Rezan's call. I will answer, but first you must help me.  Our loa give us many boons, and we repay dem in worship. Offerings, sacrifices, and idols are our tools to earn favor, but dey are much more to our loa.  Dey are sources of strength.  Zul's dogs have begun to corrupt de great golden statues dedicated to Rezan. Even now, I can feel his power dwindling.  Stop dem. Cleanse de idols to de great hunter. Teach dem to respect de house of de king."
7537,"We Are Coming : We must press our advantage before the Horde can further its hold on Darkshore.  The kaldorei stand ready to fight for our home, and the Gilneans stand alongside us.  We will show our enemies our fury. They will learn to fear us.  Rally any you can. We march at once."
7538,Foothold: Zuldazar : Zuldazar is the seat o' power fer the Zandalar empire.  I've deployed some o' me mole machines in a place called Xibala. There's a nearby Azerite deposit that'll be o' great interest to the King. My lads say they're under attack.                   - Moira Thaurissan
7539,"Of Myth and Fable : If Jaina is truly trapped in the Blighted Lands, that could mean we're not too late! We just need to find a way inside...  We will need to enlist the help of Lucille Waycrest. The legends of that place are deeply rooted in Drustvar's culture. If anyone would know more about it, it would be she.  I will send a raven ahead for her to prepare what knowledge she can gather. Make haste to Arom's Stand!"
7540,
7541,The Price of Victory : Saurfang... I...  <Lor'themar takes a moment to compose himself.>  ...Thrall will wish to honor Saurfang's sacrifice. And so shall the rest of us.  Recall our forces. Let them know what has transpired. Tell them that the great warrior Varok Saurfang is dead and that the warchief has abandoned us.  Speak to Baine when you arrive in Thunder Bluff. You will find him on the Elder Rise. I am certain he will want to pay his respects to Saurfang as well.   Let us stand as a united Horde once more.
7542,
7543,"Don't Play with Matches : These Venture Co. thugs set flame to the very oils they harvest. They hope to drive us from this land.  Their plan has a flaw. If a great wave extinguished every torch, their oil could not be lit. You can be our great wave!  Extinguish all the flames here, and we shall be victorious this day."
7544,"From the Ashes... : We must return to Stormwind, quickly!"
7545,"Requisition: We Need It All : We are dangerously low on all of our supplies. Please, you must go out and collect as much as you can.  Please return with any resources you find to the quartermaster!"
7546,"Repel the Horde! : The Horde has overrun Anglepoint, killing my people and destroying their livelihoods. Its raiders have come to Kul Tiras with killing on their minds. I cannot allow that to happen.  Slay any Horde Axe Throwers or Berserkers you see on the north shore. I will do the same on the south. Together we will stop this invasion."
7547,Grease The Wheels : Kerchunk said you guys was working on getting that mechaspider running again. Well I'm not gonna let you have all the fun!  That rusty old thing's gonna need a lot of grease to get moving again. So I jury-rigged a special Grease Trap to help you gather grease from the slimes nearby.
7548,"The March to Nazmir : Greetings, <name>. I am Blademaster Telaamon, and I have volunteered to lead this mission against the Horde.  Our forces will be gathering off the coast of Nazmir. Go now and we shall all meet there.  If all goes according to plan, we will lure the Horde away from Zandalar and bring an end to this war."
7549,"Power Protocol Initiation : We've come a long way, <name>.  Once the power from the auxiliary systems are brought online MOTHER will be able tae run diagnostics.  All that's left is settin' the final pieces in place."
7550,"Matrons of the Crimsonwood : The witches in charge, the matrons...  <Ashton shudders for a moment then composes himself.>  The matrons are the ones leading the Grand Rite. They are fearsome but not invulnerable. Removing some of them from the equation will bolster our chances of stopping this.   Take this potion. It will be able to weaken the matrons so you might have a better chance of dispatching them."
7551,"In the Hall of the Drust King : I've been watching a lot of activity going on at the ruins at the base of the massive tree by the lake. What Master Ashton reported is accurate - something important is going on down there.   We've disrupted their rituals but I worry we might have been too late.  We need to go over there. If there is anything remaining, we must destroy it."
7552,"Glittering Shell : Hi, friend. I just wanted you to know that traveling with you has been the best ever!  I never thought I could learn so much about fighting, but now I feel like I can actually hold my own.  I will protect all of the wee ones that can't protect themselves!  <Poen produces a crab from somewhere, it has a bright shell.>  Like this little one. I found him a while back, while we were out. He looked so scared.  Hey, why don't you take him?"
7553,"Machines of War and Azerite : The Norwington Estate... I remember taking walks here with my wife and children.  Sorry, this isn't the time for remembering an old life.  The Alliance have Azerite bombs and rifles scattered throughout the estate. I believe our goal is to recover them.  If only the Alliance hadn't chosen to use the estate as a testing ground... this was meant to be a place of peace."
7554,"Waning Hope : The kaldorei have been steadfast members of the Alliance since the end of the Third War. We have fought on distant shores and even on different worlds without protest.  It is curious that in our moment of need, their resources are stretched too thin to lend so much as a single blade.  Wrynn has already denied Tyrande aid. Witness it for yourself."
7555,"The Uldum Accord : You seek assistance defending the Forge of Origination? It would seem that our goals align.  The Halls of Origination are but a small portion of the forge's true scope. Any threat to Uldum would be a potential threat to the forge, and Uldum has found itself with many new enemies of late.  We were about to convene the High Council when these Wastewanders arrived unannounced. Perhaps you could join us in learning about these threats?"
7556,Blueprint: Annoy-o-Tron Gang : <This blueprint details how to build what appears to be a barrel... stuffed with tiny robots?  You should be able to upload the blueprint to Pascal-K1N6's database in Rustbolt.>
7557,
7558,"Sacred Remains : Dis area was once a lush jungle, home to many great and powerful thunder lizards.  De bones of those ancient and powerful creatures are still buried around de temple.  Great power lingers within those ancient remains... you will need such power to call upon Akunda.  Search de area and return to me with de ancient bones of de thunder lizards."
7559,"A Nose for Ptrouble : Ah, yes, I was wondering when you would come to check on your little one.  As you have likely noticed, he is not here. Little ones are very curious and often seek to leave the nest before they are ready. It is often the brooding mother's job to keep them from wandering.  What, did you think I was going to stop him?  <Wingminder Goja laughs.>  I heard some screeching to de west. Best hurry, or you may not have a hatchling to look after!"
7560,"Questionable Offerings : So the traders sent you? As I told them, I only discuss the happenings of our family with those who understand our cause.  If you wish to know his whereabouts, you must prove that you do.  Behind us are several items gathered for offering to the Wicker Man. Bring us the items you feel will most appease it, so that it might give us its blessing.  Choose the correct offerings, and we will know your intent."
7561,
7562,"Rastakhan : You stand before General Jakra'zet, lord of de armies of Zandalar, enforcer of her seas and bringer of war.  And I do not like you.   It took years to earn my place here after your Horde laid waste to my people. You will not undo what I have built.  I will see you kneel before King Rastakhan. I will watch you beg as he lets me take your head for a trophy. I will fling your corpse into de wastes of Vol'dun.  Her ""Highness"" may object... but she is not queen yet.  Come. Let us fly to your fate."
7563,"Corner Crossing : If Saurfang was headed in this direction, it would have been difficult for him to avoid the Three Corners watchpost.   We could simply walk in there and demand information, but I have a feeling that they would not part with it willingly.  So we will take another approach.  I have procured this potion from our alchemists. It will turn us into--ugh--humans for a while.  We can then question the guards. Perhaps someone saw something."
7564,"The Big Boom : Still, we've placed all those explosives, and there's nothing stopping us from detonating them and laying waste to the Horde's excavations.  Speak with Zoidfuse when you're ready, and we'll get this explosive gnome tech going!"
7565,"Lost, Not Forgotten : I know not what madness has overtaken my people, but we must stop it together.  Take this bell. It calls the souls of the recently deceased to it for later release. We Stormsong do not bury our dead in the earth. The tides claim all.  If they will not answer to reason, then we must give them eternal peace. Fallen or not, they are Stormsong."
7566,"WANTED: Jabra'kan : To any hunters worthy of the challenge:  Find and defeat the troll known as Jabra'kan. His poaching ways have robbed Warbeast Kraal of valuable eggs, hides, and beasts for their pens.  Seek out Wingrider Nivek for your reward."
7567,"The Days Are Just Packed : Hello there! Would you mind checking on someone for me?Sergeant Calvin was supposed to meet me here. We were going to go out looking for new alchemical reagents, but he hasn't shown up yet.I know the militia has been really busy lately so I guess he's busy, but he should still be in Brennadam Square. Would you mind checking in on him?"
7568,Taking the Loa Road : This road not be traveled much anymore. Except by those that serve the blood Loa. They be fools.  I be wantin' my fun from those fools. Go to the spot I be markin' for you and plant this cursed coin. The silly blood trolls be seein' it and give us a laugh when they try to pick it up.  Just be makin' sure that no other creature see you. Or else it be a quick trip back to the arms of Jani.
7569,Bolted Steelhead : <Danielle Anglers may be interested in this fish.>
7570,"Shards of Emerald : Kalecgos tells me that you seek the power of the dragonflights in its most essential form. There may be something here that can help you.  Fragments of our latent power have coalesced here in the Dream.  They are scattered about the Dreamway, where my kin have fallen. Within the Dream, you should be able to wield those fragments in their raw state."
7571,"A Little Leg Work : The legs and shocks on this mount are shot! We'll need some new ones if we're going to get this mount crawling.   A few weeks ago, Bondo and his gang rode into the Scrapbone Den hoping to scare the Troggs off. The Troggs tore their crawlers apart! The parts for those crawlers are still laying all around Scrapbone Den.  See if you can get us some of those parts from the Troggs."
7572,"A Declaration of Intent : Our caravan is ready to explore the world beyond the sands, but Nisha's blade can't be our only defense against the dangers we know await us.   This is why we've come.   To declare our intent to join the Horde."
7573,WANTED: Ayame : Well equipped exterminator wanted.  Huge snake seen lurking north of Fort Victory.   Reward offered for anyone who brings in the head of the pest.  -Garrick Blacksteel
7574,
7575,"Disarming the Cannons : With your arrival, our salvation may have arrived. Your rowboats will serve as a way for us to evacuate the most critically injured.  Unfortunately, the Horde have brought in a ship, and there's no way we can get our boats past their blockade.  While the rest of us load our injured on the boats, we need you to infiltrate their ship and disable those cannons."
7576,"House Stormsong : I have little information to offer, I'm afraid. I've scarcely left Brennadam as of late.  What they said is true. Our militia now enter town only to collect rations rather than guard traders or keep the quilboar at bay.  They say they are under orders, but those orders would only come from my brothers at the Shrine. We take oaths to serve our people... it simply does not add up.  Brother Addington is nearby at Mariner's Strand. Perhaps he knows more than I."
7577,Accessing the Archives : The information you've gathered has allowed us to better understand these manifestations.  I believe MOTHER is waiting to share some of her findings with you.
7578,"My Brother's Keeper : While I trust Valeera believes she is not leading us into a trap, I do not trust this isn't a Horde manipulation.  <name>, I want you to come with me. I will meet with Baine, but I will not do so alone."
7579,"Restorative Venom : Meerah here found your friend in the dunes. The lightning strike nearly killed her. It might still, without treatment.   The wasps within the grove have a painful sting, but their venom also has restorative properties.   I can extract what I need from their glands.  With an ample amount of venom, we should be able to soothe your friend's wounds."
7580,
7581,"Shaw's Shank Redemption : Hmm. Shaw said he'd check in when we got communications back but he hasn't. He's probably run into the same trouble the rest of our spies did.  I'll stay here and guard the listening post. You find Shaw. He was headed for the cliff above Warfang Hold near the top of the waterfall. The peons called that area ""The Screaming Pit"" for some reason. I bet it's a real pleasant place.  Stab whatever he's fighting for me, okay?"
7582,Nazmir : The blood trolls within the cursed swamp Nazmir threaten to destroy all of Zuldazar.   Princess Talanji wants the Horde's help in an expedition to strike at the heart of the blood trolls and end their threat to Zuldazar.
7583,"The Road to Corlain : Lord and Lady Waycrest lay trapped in Waycrest Manor. Before we can reach them, however, we must brave through the city of Corlain... which is firmly in the grasp of the Heartsbane.  Our first course of action should be to set up a forward outpost. Our scouts have found that the tower at Watchman's Rise is only lightly guarded. I recommend we take the tower from them.  This is now your command, Inquisitor. Say the word, and we ride."
7584,
7585,"Dark Ranger Round-Up : These night elf ambushes have left us undermanned. We need reinforcements if we are to hold Darkshore.  Brynja, one of the Dark Lady's val'kyr, can provide us with those reinforcements. Slay the night elves and command her to raise them into our service. Should any prove unwilling... deal with them.  Did I not make myself clear? Go. The Dark Lady has plans for these dark rangers."
7586,"A Paladin's Service : I found something strange while using Lindie's Scout-o-Matic that you should probably know about.  The ghost of a paladin appeared on the hill nearby. She looked straight at the Scout-o-Matic and asked for you.  I don't understand a whole lot about paladins and the Light, but I think you may not want to ignore her."
7587,"A Little Edge : In the darkest cavern. Below the naga city. You will find them.  Creepy little crabs with sharp and pointy spines.   I think we can find a way to use them. Projectiles didn't work so well in water, but now...  Harvest some for us!  Be careful, some of them are much sneakier than they have any right to be."
7588,"Enchanted Lock : <The lock appears to be secured by a magical mechanism.  It is clearly one of Mardivas', and from what you can surmise from reading the journals, it is likely locked via an arcane puzzle.  You look around the room, and see something odd in the water.>"
7589,"Drunk Angry Murlocs : Those no-good Bloodfins ran off with all of the beer!  I've been experimenting with brews that only use ingredients native to Nazjatar, but it's still a work in progress. For now, I must rely on whatever I can scrounge up from the shipwreck.  My supply of beer was already limited, but now it's all gone thanks to those thieving Bloodfin murlocs! We're going to have some very angry customers here if we don't get it back.  Please recover the stolen lager from Bloodfin Village before it's too late!"
7590,"Prepare for a Siege : It would seem we must make ready for a siege. For now, return to your Horde in Dazar'alor. Prepare for de coming conflict.Should de forces of Nazmir surge, I will send word."
7591,Silencing the Advisor : The ship's captain is nowhere to be found. Shandris and Falstad will handle locating him.  We must go after the ship's advisor. Kelsey's logs indicate her name is Ko'jan.   She may have methods to reach out to the mainland. We have to move before she tries to use any of them.
7592,"Remaining Threats : Though our forces maintain a steady hold on Darkshore, this land still festers with enemies at every turn.  Do what you can to keep them at bay, and you will be well rewarded."
7593,"Where Are the Workers? : Look at this axe, $p. There's still sweat on the hilt. The workers were here not too long ago.   Let's see if Sasha can track their scent."
7594,"Murloc Mania : I'm glad you made it out in one piece.   Judging by the nearby shipwrecks, I think it's safe to say the missing expedition ran aground here, too.  We can't move until we've got the remaining survivors back on their feet.   Unfortunately, our remaining supplies have been stolen by murlocs! Annoying little pests...  I need you to recover enough first aid supplies for the wounded.   Then we can begin searching for the missing expedition."
7595,"Run For the Hills : The quilboar are up to something, something big. You need to stop it!They've been busy bringing supplies up to the caves above their sanctum. Preserved thorns, cauldrons of venom, giant totems...They're preparing for war.Get up there and destroy those stockpiles before they can be used against the citizens of the valley!"
7596,"Calming the Spine : It is plain that the situation here is dire.  The power of the black dragonflight echoes around us, and the earth is reeling in response.   I have heard tales of ruptures like these on Kul Tiras and Zandalar. The elementals have been driven into a frenzy, and they bar our way from seeking the essence.  If we are to preserve the tenuous balance of the elements here, the wounds must be mended, <name>."
7597,"Heads Will Roll : Zul's forces try to lay claim to de loa of kings's temple.  You must teach dese traitors de meaning of their actions.  Sweep de temple of de filth dat defiles it. Destroy those who spit in de face of de loa. Bring me their heads so I may remind others of what happens to those who betray their faith and their king.  When you are finished dealing with de unworthy, come find us. Rezan's altar lies deep within de temple grounds.  In Rastakhan's name, heads will roll!"
7598,
7599,"Re-Origination : If the Ramkahen haven't reached out tae sound any alarms then the anomaly must be contained within the Halls of Origination.  We best get back tae investigate, <name>."
7600,"Zelling's Potential : <cough> My body won't last much longer, but Miss Voss insists I display what my powers truly are.  I can instill within you a <cough> <wheeze> magical font that will absorb void essence from slain creatures.  When the font is full, you can unleash devastating wind magic.  Go to <cough> Port Fogtide. There you will find those tainted by the Void.  Slay them, fill the font, and you will <wheeze> see my magic at work."
7601,"Energy Cells for Everyone : The wondrous scuttlebutt around town is that the charging station in Bondo's Yard is going to be repaired today!  That charging station is the best way to recharge all the Empty Energy Cells that've been piling up in your bag. Or in other people's bag. Or inside the mechanical innards of robots you don't own but are legally allowed to destroy.  After you've acquired Empty Energy Cells, help build the charging station in Bondo's Yard and charge all of your Empty Energy Cells!"
7602,"Retaliation Coordination : Master Shaw deployed a number of Alliance spies near a base the Horde have made in Stormsong Valley. When our spies stopped checking in, he took Kelsey Steelspark and went to investigate.   Now Master Shaw is the one who hasn't checked in.  I need someone to go in and find our missing people and give them whatever help they clearly need."
7603,"The Eternal Palace: We Can Make It Stronger... : Now that it's functioning, it occurred to me while repairing it that it has the capability to output even more energy.Of course that'll require stronger materials to upgrade and the only place I can think of is in the Eternal Palace.Azshara's army and even herself carry items of extraordinary power. If you could bring some of those back, I could at the very least test my theory and see if it's viable."
7604,"Sending Out An SOS : I noticed an exodus from the fleet, far out in the harbor.  Flyers were sent out, they seek something, or someone.  Those ships made a great journey, and they have much work ahead.  Please check in with Captain Grez'ko. I am sure he could use a hand!"
7605,"Direhorn Daycare : Handler Bazkoji had a real gift with de little ones. If dis hatchling is following you, it must mean Bazkoji is dead.  I don't have time to find another handler. Are you up to de task?  It's a lot of work, and de little ones get attached real fast. If you're going to care for it, it will be a commitment. That baby will be depending on you. I hope you will be up to de task of feeding and protecting it.  First things first: food. Dere is plenty of fodder in de pens and river below."
7606,Terrace of the Chosen : This betrayal has cut deep into the heart of Zandalar. Half of the Zanchuli Council and their followers have sided with Zul and his... blood god.Lucky for us not all of Zandalar is behind this betrayal.We need to topple Zul's cultists before they can rally too many to their cause. Zanchul is the place to start.Go and see if you can muster any of the Zandalari still loyal to their king.
7607,
7608,"Roughneck Riders : Rulf sent word that you're needed for another job.  A rich house cat is willing to pay top dollar for a male aerie alpha and there is only one that fits the bill, Greatfeather. I gotta head back to camp to help train a particularly wild female, so this is going to be a solo job.  Find Greatfeather and hit him with the Tether Shot. From there, you'll have to wing it."

7610,"The Savage Hunt : The blood trolls in Nazmir are monsters, pure and simple. No culture, no empathy, they only exist to destroy.  Let's kill 'em and let whatever dark god they worship sort them out."
7611,"Taking the Blood Gate : We have our forces spread out throughout Nazmir, but we need to do something that will force Rastakhan into action.  We must personally march into Zuldazar and take the Blood Gate. This will cause them to throw their full army at us.  As you can see, we're the only ones left that can assault the Blood Gate.  Shaw and Telaamon will stay behind to help the rest of the army move up.   You and I will ride the battle beast into the Blood Gate and take it by force."

7614,"Bugs, Lots of 'Em! : You got a problem with mechanical bugs, so the Roughriders are here to sort this mess out!  In my experience, this big of an outbreak must have some sort of queen bug behind it all. We gonna go in, kill a lot of bugs till we find the leader of 'em all.  Horde or Alliance don't matter, you're with the Roughriders today. Let's kill some bugs!"
7615,"Old Allies : Sylvanas was my Ranger-General. I have respected her for millennia. Making this choice is something I have been wrestling with for some time. Baine's death will tear the Horde apart. The Tauren will not stand for it and if they leave, I know they will not be the last.  We must save Baine. Not just for his life, but for the Horde. I can only hope once the time pressure is gone we may be able to reason with her but...   I have contacted allies who will help. Meet them in the Cleft of Shadows."
7616,"Beaten But Not Broken : <Beastbreaker Hakid's crystal-encrusted key looks like it will open the large cage nearby.  The pterrordax inside that cage, Scion of Rakjan, is stronger than the other hatchlings you've seen in the Crackling Ridge. He holds his head high and doesn't seem bothered by the myriad scars and fresh wounds that cover his body.  If you release him, he'll likely want to return to Rakjan the Unbroken at the top peak of Crackling Ridge.>"
7617,"Saurid Surprise : Da sands of Vol'dun be full of harsh creatures, but none so harsh as dey dat da Zandalari send.  One of dese criminals be right here in da Scorched Sands.

7618,"So Long, Sister : We have given the defenders some breathing room, but these creatures continue to lay siege to the barricade!  The witch behind the attack fled from the field when we defeated her forces. I saw her go into the mansion on the hill. I will help keep the defenses going here.  You must go into the mansion and slay the witch!"
7619,"Crucible of Storms: Relics of Shadow : Your intention to stop the naga attacks was noble, <name>. But that shadowy dagger tricked you into delivering powerful relics into the hands of a great enemy.  No doubt those artifacts will be well defended. Gather your allies, <class>, and return to the Crucible of Storms.  Defeat any opponents that stand in your way. Ensure the relics cannot be used against the Alliance.  The naga cannot be allowed to summon their storm... or to call forth something even worse."
7620,"The Irontide Crew : You see those salty looking guys in red? That's the Irontide crew.  They're the worst of the worst. Cutthroats and brigands, to a man.

7621,"Allies in Anarchy : Even after all these years, I can feel the ancient power of Sethraliss in this place. My loa endures.  Our task ahead is great and I will need a clear, focused mind to accomplish it. Allow me a few moments to meditate here, like I did in ages past.  In the meantime, you should help the vulpera stir up trouble however you can. They seem to know you, and a large enough disturbance will distract the Faithless from our mission.  Meet me back here when you're done and we'll proceed together."
7622,"The Mysterious Sigil : <The slain mogu clutches a sigil in his hand -- a symbol of the mysterious clan he belongs to.  Perhaps if you could track down his clan, they may know more about the mantid's invasion of Mogu'shan Vaults and how they can be overcome.  Lorewalker Cho is well known as font of lore for Pandaria. He may be able to track down the origins of the mogu's sigil.>"

And he requested you be de one to deliver dem.Don't ask me why he didn't just have you deliver these when you were here de first time. De prophet is notorious for not sharing all of his visions.
7626,Meet with Meerah : It appears we're making good progress.  Would you meet up with Meerah?  I want to be sure she's found her way to the vintner in Suramar.
7627,"Unsafe Work Conditions : Those rampaging bots ain't lettin' up!  We're payin' good money for the best and brightest goblins on the planet, and I ain't gonna let some malfunctionin' machinery take 'em outta the shift schedule.

7628,"Poisoning the Brood : Now we have room for our plan to kill Hir'eek. You see, <name>, my specialty is in making potions and poisons.  I am working on a poison to use on Hir'eek, when de time comes. I have no idea if it will work or not.  I want you to take what I already made and use it on de bats around here.

7631,Heroic Warfront: The Battle for Stromgarde : Our enemies are relentless in their quest to seize Arathi for themselves. We will never allow it to fall into their hands! We must stop them before the keep is rebuilt!  Take up arms. The Alliance is upon us.
7632,"Forbidden Rites : These k'thir have been hiding among us, sowing the seeds of their dark masters with us none the wiser.  With the barrier around the Abyssal Melody lowered I can peer within; its bowels toil with my own people giving themselves to the shadow!  Take my tidal kris; its blade is now coated in purified tideblood. Put an end to these fiends and their foul rituals."
7633,"Mech versus Airship : We're all set to go, thanks to them battle plans ya found. Looks like Mekko ain't gonna be at his airship right now.  Here's the plan. We're gonna go seriously mess up his ship, then Mekko is gonna swing by to try to save his friends.  But instead, he's gonna find you and me standin' on the deck of his burnin' ship, waitin' to take him out!  Get in to the mech, <name>, we're blowin' up an airship and a gnome!"

7636,Blueprint: Microbot XD : <This blueprint details how to build what appears to be an adorable miniature robot.  You should be able to upload the blueprint to Pascal-K1N6's database in Rustbolt.>
7637,Saving Master Ashton : I believe I see Master Ashton in a cage. He must be freed!  Those witches with the long masks appear to be in charge. I bet they would have the means to open his cage.  I will remain here to protect Apprentice Webb and keep the area secure.
7638,"Back Out to Sea : Now that things're under control here, I'm sure they could use your help back in Nazjatar!  Why don't ye head back out tae sea, err, or under the sea, tae lend a hand with the new folk there?"
7639,"The Pirate's Treasure : I sense another relic. A trident thought lost to the depths. It calls to me, <name>. Do you hear it too?  Its song takes form. I see a harbor to the east. An ambitious pirate, greedy and proud. Completely unaware of the power hidden within her hoard of gold.  The would-be-captain's hubris will not permit her to simply hand over her prize. I fear she must be taught a rather harsh lesson.  But that is your specialty, is it not?"
7640,"Midnight in the Garden of the Loa : Yazma and her henchtroll Vol'kaal have pulled most of their forces back to de Garden of de Loa.   Something bad is afoot, I can feel it in my spirit. Pa'ku is in danger, along with all de loa who have followers dere.  Come, let's fly dere and put an end to dese heresies."
7641,"Greener Pastures : You have done an adequate job keeping de little one fed, but sometimes they just want something else.  I did not see where de hatchling went, but you should start where de grass is real green. You will likely find her eating it.  If you have trouble bringing her home, you might try a bribe."
7642,"Backup While I Pack Up : I came in here tae try an' reclaim as many relics as possible. Sneakin' in was easy, but I'm worried about things noticin' me while I pack up. Mind watching me back while I get the relics stored in a safe place in my bag?"
7643,"Broadside Bedlam : <The ship's cannons are currently pointed at the other Forsaken ship across the water.  However, it appears the crew hasn't loaded them with gunpowder or cannonballs yet... Probably to avoid any accidental firings while they're anchored here.  Yes, it'd be a real shame if ""accidental"" cannon fire damaged the other ship.>"
7644,"As the Dust Settles : We have achieved a great victory, <name>, though at a cost.  King Wrynn is gathering the Alliance leadership in Unity Square to discuss matters. He has requested our presence as well.   Go to Unity Square. I'll meet you there shortly."

Help solve that problem and I shall be free to assist you in... whatever it is?  Let's see... Yes! Here! Take these.

7648,"Black Moon Rising : Darkshore has never been known for being bright and sunny, but something strange has happened here. A black moon hangs over everything.  None of the scouts I sent into the forest have returned. The night elves are up to something. And I need to know what it is.  Their rank-and-file won't have the information we seek. Hunt down their lieutenants and get them to talk by any means necessary."
7649,"Requisition: More Kelp Buds : We need rations for our forces. While kelp buds do not have the same delicious taste as other options, it is nutritious and plentiful near any kelp forests. This makes it our first choice for making rations.  If you happen to find any around Nazjatar, please leave your stores with the quartermaster. The ones freshly fallen from kelp are best."
7650,"Making Ourselves at Home : Log cabins will do in a pinch, but... if we're going to be spending any time here, we might as well make ourselves comfortable.  The roughnecks left us no shortage of lumber and food supplies, but we'll need canvas and chains to set up some proper Forsaken tents and banners. Bridgeport sounds rather lootable, doesn't it?"
7651,"The Weight of My Ambition : As with the other settlements, I too relied on the services of sailors and watercraft to deliver supplies. They proved very useful in their diligence, and their silence.Predictably, they drew the attention of enemies, including those below the waves. Their anchor was hexed, dragging them beneath the ocean before they could so much as cry out.I have seen them, hoisting ethereal sails and singing shanties of the damned. If these waters are to be safe again, they must be silenced again. For good."
7652,Calibrate the Core : The Embiggifier is nearly ready! All that's left to do is calibrate its core.   The best way to do that without catastrophic results is to use it on things that are already dead.  This should be a simple task!  I have a hunch you excel at making things dead.
7653,"Journey to the Middle of Nowhere : Our tidesage, Thomas Zelling, claims to have found the wreckage of Marshal Valentine's ship.  Took him long enough.  Marshal Valentine's body is the final piece of our plan, and it lies within that shipwreck. When you're ready, let us depart for his resting place."
7654,"Ride Out to Meet Them : We must defend our warriors from the Alliance army while we recover this Azerite.  Take the Azerite weapons you stole and load them onto one of these gyrocopters.  Misha and I will ride out and fight the reinforcements from the ground, while you provide air support.  We need to hold them off until our warriors can retreat with the Azerite."
7655,"The Underrot: Sealing G'huun's Corruption : Massive leak of G'huun corruption located nearby. Substance surrounding us indicator of G'huun corruption, named underrot.  Initial scans suggest a massive abomination composed of underrot is ahead, releasing more corruption into Nazmir.  Must destroy Unbound Abomination, contain G'huun's corruption.  Function clear. Proceed inside."

7658,"Getting the Message : Da loa be powerful, but we be needin' soldiers if we gonna have a chance of stopping dem blood trolls from building dat giant of theirs.

The lens appears to have been specifically crafted for someone else's eyes.  Given the intricate detail on the spyglass, they'd likely provide a hefty reward for its return.>"
7660,"Hunting Blood Prince Dreven : Between the information I gathered from my scouting mission and Mathias Shaw's intel, we know exactly where Blood Prince Dreven is going to be.  We will have our revenge, $p. For ourselves, for my sisters, for the Alliance.  We won't underestimate the san'layn this time. We will keep the Horde off-balance and distracted with swift, targeted, ruthless attacks.  Thankfully, the Wildhammer are masters of those combat tactics. I'm glad they'll be joining us.  Are you ready to leave?"
7661,"Negative Blood : Okay, you want to kill the herald of a blood god? We can figure something out.  There's corrupted blood nearby that's feeding this monster's power. Lucky for you, I've heard stories of this sort of thing before.  Take this scroll, but be careful with it! It'll destroy the corrupted blood that's feeding Jungo.  Oh, and I need you to find a scroll Holbruk was carrying, called the Scroll of Fate's Hand. It's REALLY powerful. We'll need it."
7662,"Our Mountain Now : <name>, go take care of those ""roughnecks."" They might fashion themselves as tough, but a bit of your unique brand of Horde savagery should have them running in no time.  Lilian, scout the area. We need to know about any nearby threats.  Rangers, secure the perimeter. We'll reconvene in the roughneck camp once <name>'s work is done."
7663,"The Horde Uprising : Given the potential of Azerite to change the face of warfare, it comes as no surprise that the Warchief seeks to lay claim to it. Reports indicate that she is mobilizing an army to march on Silithus--the site of the great wound.  Heroes of the Horde and the Alliance fought side-by-side during the Argus campaign. To think that Sylvanas is ready to cast that unity aside...  Speak with Mathias Shaw. I want you to oversee our presence in Silithus."
7664,
7665,
7666,"Douse the Flames : Do you smell it, <name>? Smoke! They're burning down Warfang Hold!  There is little point to our battle if our base burns to the ground!  Their tidesages use wands to control their constructs of water. In our hands they may give us a chance to save the Hold!   Get those wands and put out the fires before the camp burns to ash!"
7667,"Batteries Not Included : You will not be sorry that you rescued my dear sister and me, $p.  We are the vanguard of a new technological revolution, creating opportunities for all to enhance their lives with incredible technology!  But, before we can do that, we need our laboratory to be fully powered. Those ruffians from Mechagon really did a number on our equipment.  Fully charged energy cells are exceptionally rare around here, but I can make do with broken ones.  Check around town, in the wreckage from the last attack."
7668,"The Lord's Behest : Lord Norwington will want to thank you for saving his son himself. Why don't you come to the estate? We're preparing for a festival, and everybody's welcome.We'll go ahead and tell him of all that has happened. See you there!"

Don't tell Thaelin.  The components for the ritual are now prepared. All ye need to do is add the Firelands Slag to the Unstable Magma an' a great bein' from the Firelands will heed our call.

Would you do me the honor of retrieving my favorite horse from the estate on the hill?Imagine, our guests' first impression of you to be on the most regal horse in all of Tiragarde! Wondrous!"
7671,"You Have Their Orders : The Horde is an army, make no mistake. And armies need orders.Someone must be giving orders here. They know the plan, and I want to know the plan too.Look for the people who seem to be in charge and see if you can uncover any intelligence so we know what to do next."
7672,"The Warchief Commands : Silithus. That has been the name of the game... or rather, that is what I wanted the Alliance to believe.   Make no mistake, Azerite is just as powerful as it is rumored to be but I have bigger plans in mind.  High Overlord Saurfang is leading an army towards Silithus. By now, he should be in the Northern Barrens. I want you to intercept him and notify him that the preparations are complete.  Preparations for what, you ask? Why, we are going to capture the World Tree."
7673,With Honor : The Alliance and Kul Tiran forces are in disarray. I can hear the Azerite tank powering up.  Lieutenant Cole intends to fight us... now that his forces are destroyed.  Let me know when you are ready to fight. The three of us shall destroy this tank while our warriors watch on!
7674,"Only the Best Will Do : You heard Gazlowe. The boss wants this expedition to go smoothly. No cutting corners, no slush.  I know you've worked with Gallywix in the past. We don't run our operations like that.  We expect the best from our crews, so we pay 'em what they're worth and treat 'em well. In return, we got the best goblin crews on the planet, and they ain't goin' over to any competition.  Here's a list of who and what we're gonna need to pull this off. Don't worry, Gazlowe'll cover all the costs."
7675,"Adapt, Improve, Overcome! : Izira Gearsworn is still alive, she is Rustbolt's strongest fighter, but her legs are broken. If we're going to survive I need parts to repair and upgrade her.  There are machines all over with parts we can salvage. With some perseverance we should be able to fix Izira's legs.  Help me obtain the following parts."
7676,"A Gulper Ate The Rolly : The Bubble-eyed Rolly used to be plentiful in the nearby pond.  Last week they all started to vanish!  A large water elemental has been swallowing all the fish! They are still alive, just swimming around inside the elemental now.  I need you to kill that elemental, and catch three Bubbly-eyed Rolly so I can examine their condition."
7677,"A Direct Approach : Maokka has such a gentle heart. He is so good with the little ones, always playing games and telling stories.  We do however really dislike these Venture Co. individuals, so I suggest a more direct approach.  Try killing them all."
7678,"Reinforced Cache : <The heavily reinforced chest is of naga construction and appears to be reinforced with a heavy-duty lock of some kind.  Reinforcement aside, the cache still requires a key to unlock.  The key is most likely being held by one of the nearby naga soldiers.>"
7679,"Weathered Pamphlet : <This pamphlet appears to be a mass-produced flier advertising an Azerite-buying service.  You can make out a few faded but colorful phrases like ""Your fortune awaits in the Great Sea!"" and ""Everyone's getting rich, isn't it your time?""   There is no mention of any of the dangers involved.  There is some information about who to contact at the bottom, however.>"
7680,"Let the Residue Lead You : I've fashioned a device that will emit bioluminescent light when toggled on, allowing you to see any Azerite residue that lingers.   It should give you a clear trail to the weapons cache.   Good luck, <name>."
7681,"A Warlock's Bargain : While you were mowing down hordes of undead, I was scouting more of the area with Lindie's device.  I saw what looked like a portal out near the bridge, along with the corpse of a warlock we thought was lost in the shipwreck.  Think you can go investigate the area and try to close that portal? We have enough problems on this island as it is."
7682,Shifting Gears : <name>! The Alliance has made a new request for Gnomeregan's might in the coming war. It is my honor to inform you that Captain Sparknozzle wishes for your expert assistance in the matter.  You are hereby requested to meet him in New Tinkertown.
7683,"Not Our Purple Elves : Ye know, <name>, these elves might be purple, but they're no' with the Alliance.  Leastwise, they're a lot more aggressive than this ol' Dark Iron is comfortable with.  On the off chance it'll piss off the Horde, ye mind killin' a few of them?"
7684,"Nazmir, the Forbidden Swamp : Da Horde promised Princess Talanji dat we be dealin' with dese blood trolls in Nazmir before dey can attack Zuldazar.

7685,"Seeing Spirits : The spirits in the cemetery are riled up! I'd ask 'em direct but I don't have any of the necessary salve I use to commune with the dead. My family's been making it for ages!  The herbs and tools I use to make it are inside, but I can't get over there! Some of those spirits are beyond reason and attack me on sight!  Why don't you go collect those herbs, make the salve with my tools, and ask one of the calmer spirits what's going on. Aaron Cresterly is a good spirit to look for."
7686,
7687,"Evidence of Evil : Jakra'zet refused to patrol dis area. Yazma's spies did not warn us of de evil lurking beneath our city. And Zul did not foresee blood magics festering under our noses.

7689,"Powerful Conductors : Akunda offers us a chance to start anew.   Through a sacred ritual, de loa enters our mind and removes de memories dat cause us pain.   If you seek Akunda's blessing, den you must first prepare for de ritual.   De pests dat feed on de wildlife here have antennae dat are great conductors for magic. De larger, de better.   Their leader's antennae should do de trick. He's easily three times de size of de normal ranishu."
7690,"The Murderous Matron : I know that you've got what you came for, but I need to ask you one more favor.  This town won't be safe until this Matron Levae is taken care of.   According to the letter, she must be holed up in that cave. None of our people have been able to enter it, but I know I've seen their constructs go in!  This charm you found might be the key. If you can take control of one of these wicker men and send it after her, we might have a shot!"
7691,"The Abandoned Passage : My people have known about this ancient passageway for generations, but none have dared enter before now.  The tunnel leads to the tomb of Mythrax the Unraveler and it is said that his power still radiates within the cavern. Who knows what horrors await us inside...  It appears that your friends have already gone inside to face Jakra'zet and stop him from raising Mythrax from the dead.  We don't have time to waste. We must find Kaja and Rakera before they confront Jakra'zet on their own!"
7692,
7693,"Any Ammo Will Do : I'll have some men move some cannons down to the sea wall in preparation of whatever ritual is going on down in that delta.

7699,"The Urn of Voices : Vol'jamba does possess de Sight, and so even now he is taking precautions against us.  Regrettably his vision is incomplete. You will help me prepare for his demise and deal with his followers simultaneously. De tool you will use is called de Urn of Voices.  Take it and venture into Tal'gurub. Slay his followers, destroy their golems and masks. Their spirits, once released, will fill de urn.  Oh, and try not to die while holding it. De Urn of Voices is not discerning."
7700,"Nesingwary's Trek : De greatest hunter from your lands, de dwarf Nesingwary, has come to participate in de Great Hunt.If you are enough of a hunter to join him, den travel to de Nesingwary Trek along de northeastern region of Zuldazar."
7701,"Elemental Core : <A burned-out core from the elementals you encountered.  When you concentrate, you can sense that some elemental energy still exists, deep within the core.  They were clearly after the Azerite, but why?  It might be time to call in an old favor.>"
7702,"Back to the Lab : Our work here is done!  Well, at least until another one of my humble experiments goes horribly awry, rapidly spiraling out of control into a chain reaction of catastrophic failures.  But, let's worry about that another time, $p.  I'll meet you back at my lab!"
7703,"Inspection Gadget : Some time ago, a good friend of mine who had a tinker shop in Boralus just stopped all correspondence. With the state of foreign affairs, I wasn't able to look for him myself until recently.  It's not just him. It seems that all of the gnomes that were living in the city just up and vanished.  I've decided to start my search with these ruins, but the machines here have gone haywire. Could you go get a good magnetic reading on the place?"
7704,"Stubborn as a Bronzebeard : It's kind o' Brann tae offer, but his flying machine would drop like a rock with me aboard. Best if it carry just the two of ye.  Brann will fly ye down to Uldir. I'll find me own way and meet ye inside."
7705,"A Missing Master : Master Ashton had me grab some healing supplies and run to Mayor Royston when those things attacked town. He didn't make it behind the barricade.  But if he's alive--and he's just crazy enough he might be--he's probably holed up in his cottage. With caustic compounds. And explosives.  Look, why don't you go check out his basement and I'll stay out of the blast radi- I mean I'll go see if the garden can be salvaged.  Try not to look flammable."
7706,
7707,"No One Left Behind : De warriors here tell me Rokhan made a heroic stand, holding off de Alliance and their champions before being defeated.  Rokhan is still here within de Blood Gate, held captive by some strange creature called a Lightforged.  I must stay here and help hold de line. I need you to rescue Rokhan!"
7708,"Haywire Harvesters : See the golems down there? Farmers use their sharp claws to reap the harvest, but these are cutting timber...   Why would they need them here when they have so many laborers on hand?  I think the militia is using them to intimidate their own people!  See if you can get ahold of an intact mainspring from one. I've helped repair a few back in Boralus. I should be able to figure out who is messing with their innards."
7709,Big Gulls Won't Die : Still one more... takes my bait... my fish...  My finger...  Kill him... you will be... rewarded...
7710,Bramblethorn : I was playing with Lord and Lady Sharptooth when Papa made me come with him. I dropped poor Lord Sharptooth and one of those big mean monsters grabbed him!   Papa said he'd try to get him back but he's been gone a long time. I think he got busy. Mama and all the adults are busy doing stuff for Mayor Royston.  Lady Sharptooth and I are really sad. Can you beat up that mean monster and save my dino?
7711,"We Have Them Cornered : General Rakera has already begun mobilizing our forces to our next target: Zalamar.  Once we destroy de Alliance dere, we can push forward to de coast and destroy de source of dis fog.  De Alliance will have nowhere to hide. We will surround their fleet and end dis war, once for all.  Dey will wish dey never stepped foot in Nazmir.  Come. We shall ride together to Zalamar and ensure our victory!"
7712,"Voyage to the West : Reconnaissance reports that the Horde has made inroads into the desert of Vol'dun.  We can't allow the Horde to continue to work there unchecked, so we're preparing an expedition to establish a beachhead.  <name>, as one of our most accomplished soldiers I'd appreciate if you joined us. Your help will be essential for the success of our mission.  Wrap up your affairs here in the harbor and report to Grand Admiral Jes-Tereth. We will set sail when you're ready."
7713,"Head of the Viper : While I was scouting out the area, I saw a big armored naga bossing the rest of the snakes around. Call it a hunch, but I'm pretty sure he's their leader.As long as the Naga have a commander our operations here will be threatened. Take him out."
7714,"The Beatings Will Continue : Ain't seen you before. You a mercenary?   I got some guys need roughin' up.  <The grizzled woman spits through a gap where her front tooth should be.>  Ever since Harlan started fancyin' himself an admiral, his Irontide guppies been struttin' around like they own the place. Forcin' other crews to swear loyalty to Harlan, beatin' on us what can't defend ourselves.  Freehold was never a safe town, but at least it was free.  <She runs her tongue along the gap in her teeth.>  Bastards."
7715,"Meeting of the Minds : We're in luck. The missive details a meeting in Zo'bal Ruins between Talanji, Rokhan, Areiel, and Blood Prince Dreven.  This is our chance to gain more intel on Dreven and his next move. He killed our soldiers in Vol'dun, it's time for him to pay.  Meet me outside of Zo'bal Ruins. We're going to sneak into the ruins, listen to their plans, and decide what to do next."
7716,
7717,"Facing the Invaders : While we try to figure out what to do with those channelers, we'll have to take shots where we can get them.  Our men could use some assistance retaking parts of the lower walls. Kill some naga for me, would you?"
7718,"Investigating the Highlands : When I first sensed these essences, I did not anticipate the importance of the role they would play. It is only a matter of time before all of the dragonflights are brought into the fold.  Though I have reached out to the other Aspects, I have yet to hear from Alexstrasza. It is odd that she would be silent while these powers manifest.  She was last seen in the Vermillion Redoubt in Twilight Highlands.  I fear she may be in trouble. We must hurry."
7719,"Let's Get It Started : I theorize this to be a communication relay. It is non-operational, but gnomish ingenuity and your strong back shall soon solve that problem!  I need you to help get this device functional."
7720,"Operation: Cutpurse : It is time to reconvene for our next mission, though Shandris and I disagree on what exactly that should entail.  Meet us on the Wind's Redemption."
7721,"Boaring Company : I don't see her body anywhere. That means she could still be alive.The Briarback have been taking prisoners, and anyone who has ever been taken by them was never seen again.We have a single chance here and we need to take it!Come with me into the kraul and free as many of the survivors as you can. And if you can, find Farmer Deal. See if she's still alive."
7722,"Under the Cover of Swiftwing : Aye! So we be the first in this crazy operation. We'll be hitchin' a ride on Swiftwing to tha Isle of Fangs.  The Zandalari got one of their main ships there, called the Breath of Pa'ku, whatever that is.  Hop on ta Swiftwing when yer ready te go. It's gonna get real cozy on there with all of ye comin' aboard."
7723,"Headbutting 101 : Your beast is looking well fed. Good. Try and keep it dat way.  Now, next you need to teach your little one to defend itself. Direhorns in de wild are prey for much larger creatures and de young are easy pickings for saurid and their like.  Go out into de Savagelands and show your little one how to fend dem off.  It's all in de horn, <name>."
7724,"Minesweeper : The Alliance are stalling our efforts here with this irritating fog, as well as layering the entire area with traps.  We will suffer too many casualties if we try marching our army through this trap-infested area.  I've heard you're good at sneaking around. Use your talents to disarm the traps in this area.  I'll deal with getting the goblin's parts back from the Alliance while you disarm those traps."
7725,"Trouble at Fort Daelin : I was sent to Brennadam by my commanding officer to find a tidesage to help us at Fort Daelin to the west. The naga have started another attack on the bastion, and it's larger than any we have seen.   Lieutenant Bauer is in the middle of helping out civilians at the village near the fort, and she could use any help possible."
7726,
7727,"King or Prey : My loa has seen fit to question my resolve.  For my people, my pride, and my faith, we will correct dis. Return to your Horde. Ready your forces, and I will ready mine.  When de time comes, we will strike back against de traitorous snake, Zul."
7728,"The Scamps : You there! You have legs and a need for money? I wish to hire you.Confounded, despicable, parentless children have been stealing my scrolls again. Those scrolls are dangerous in the wrong hands.What is worse, I believe these junior vagabonds to be organized.Find these street scamps and relieve them of their bounty, and I shall pay you for it."
7729,"Suspicious Shipments : Normally I wouldn't tell you nothin'... but I'll spill it for Cyrus.  Ashvane's onto somethin' big.  They got guys workin' round the clock in there. Even brought in some muscle to keep everyone uh... ""motivated.""  I don't know anything about what they're makin', but I know it ain't passin' through here to Boralus.  If I were dumb enough to go snooping around in there, I'd look at the goods themselves. See if they got shipping labels.  But I ain't that dumb, so you gotta do it."
7730,"The Great Hat Robbery : Along this road the merchants ride. Taking dere wares from one place to another and lining them own pockets.   One Big Mon named Tik'su be the worst of all. He charge arms and legs outright and it even take trolls some time to regrow them parts.  His biggest pride? His hat.   Go be my messenger, Rich-mon. Scare his burdened beast and knock off Tik'su. Then bring me his hat."
7731,"An Unnatural Crew : Blood Prince Dreven is here, and the situation's even worse than we thought.  That monster's training other san'layn. Every neophyte you see on this ship is another future Blood Prince Dreven.  His vile practices cannot be allowed to spread within the Horde. We're going to tear the san'layn out, right now, root and all."
7732,"Into the Dunes : Whatever Rakera uncovered, it was important enough to earn her a death sentence to de sands.   We must head into Vol'dun to find her.   We cannot let whatever she knows about Jakra'zet die with her in de dunes."
7733,"Silencing the Sisters : The sirens in this tideway have drawn countless ships to their doom. Wiping them out would be a boon to all seafaring folk.  But you can't very well kill all of them. Only a fool would try that.  The real dangerous ones are the elders. The ""sisters"" as they're known. Bigger, smarter, and stronger than the younger ones. Their voices carry far out to sea and bring in all the big ""catches.""  I managed to track two of them to a den at the northern end of the tideway, but I can't take them alone."
7734,"Repurposing Their Village : Myself and Shaw will provide support for Telaamon's army until our distraction is set up.  First, we need to clear the blood trolls out of their nearby village, Zalamar, in order to move our army forward.  That's where you come in. We need you to assault the blood trolls there to weaken their forces, then our army will arrive.  Telaamon will be on site to help you, meet with him once you've weakened their forces.   I will be here with Shaw ensuring our forces aren't seen."
7735,"Restraining Order : ""Something feels different""? Dat was all Raal said?His flock of pterrordaxes have swarmed de courtyard of Zanchul. Dey are being driven mad.Shoo dem away before dey hurt demselves or others."
7736,"Explosions Always Work : The area surrounding Tidecaller Nezara is heavily guarded, so I'll need you to create a distraction.   Take these explosives. Plant them on the naga's harpoon launchers. Once they've been detonated, the blast should be more than enough to send the guards running!"
7737,
7738,"Saving for Later : We need time to recover the artifacts from this place. Time the naga will not let us have.  However, we do have a plan.  We simply hide what we don't want them to find, and then come back in a decade or two. They will have forgotten about this place by then.  Take this illusion scroll and use it to conceal the notable artifacts of power."
7739,"Rearmament : The people of this valley have true hearts, <name>. They're eager to take back control of their home.  We have to help them.  The Brineworks up the road from here supplies most of House Stormsong's weapons. Our movement here could make great use of them.  If you can collect enough to go around, I'll go over some basic training with our friends here."
7740,
7741,"The Final Pieces : The final components you'll need to acquire are... vessels... rune vessels! Armor to hold the might that will be imbued.  And... powers? No... missives? Yes! Missives will allow your item to enhance your own personal strengths. But they cannot be the same. No, the two must offer different benefits.  All of these can be obtained from souls with the correct crafting knowledge.  And lastly, more of my memories. Memories of the runes, of the powers... of myself."
7742,"The Weight of Stone : The campaign continues, $p. The Stone Legion is here to turn the tide of battle.  First, we must deliver supplies to our allies. The broken land of Korthia means we are the only ones who can keep our troops supplied.  Second, we must deal with the mawsworn and the devourers. I have a very simple strategy. We are going to drop anima onto the mawsworn. That will attract the devourers to attack. Either they kill the mawsworn, or the mawsworn kills them. Regardless, we win."
7743,"The Games We Play : Do not worry about me. We have a bigger problem.I heard their leader around here somewhere during the attack. I have been keeping watch from here but I have not been able to see them. They must be using some sort of glamour to hide themselves.I have yet to meet a spriggan who can resist a game. If you find one eager to play and can win, then perhaps you can learn something about their leader."
7744,"Repeat After Me : The Primus placed guardians in the area around the Sepulcher to protect the knowledge within. Each embodied the virtues of one of the five houses.  To gain entrance, you must prove yourself worthy by besting these protectors.   Seek out the rune stones that represent the houses of Maldraxxus. Pay attention to the words inscribed on each stone, then pay deference each house's values.  If you honor the stone, its protector will come forth. Defeat each of them."
7745,"Observing Teamwork : It's truly fascinating how conflict drives your kind, mortal. Members of my cartel have a keen interest in observing your combat prowess in action.  I am told that some of your most impressive martial demonstrations involve combat between predetermined teams. My people are unfamiliar with such contests.  Would you be willing to offer a demonstration?"
7746,"Just Don't Ask Me to Spell It : It's getting dangerous out there for druid spirits!  Thankfully, we always have room for another friend in our group, and this fine tirnenn has offered to help me and the gang get around the battlefield safely.  <The tirnenn behind Choofa begins speaking slowly, but Choofa just talks louder.>  Good ol' Kirriprkar- I mean, Karripkraker- I mean, Krackerkrisp...  <Choofa laughs.>  Let's just call her ""Big K""!  Hop on, everybody!"
7747,"Shaping Fate : The Jailer's power and malevolence continue to grow. So must our resilience.  Stand amongst your allies, <name>. Push back against the darkness that would consume us all.  Together, we will yet prevail.  May the Purpose guide your hand."
7748,"The Primus Returns : The Jailer has four of the five sigils required for what he is planning.  He is a fool for allowing us to live. His desire to see us bend to his will shall be his undoing.  All is not lost, if you are willing to put in the work. There is still something that can be done.  Come. I will meet with the rest of your forces and formulate our next attack."
7749,
7750,"Forces of Perdition : Survival requires that we keep our enemies in check, Maw Walker.  With Gorgoa overflowing, the Mawsworn continue to gain strength.  Perdition Hold has been fortified with fresh troops. We cannot allow the Mawsworn to bolster their ranks any further.  Make your way into Perdition Hold and decimate their forces. When the work is done, you may return to me for your reward."
7751,"Aiding Maldraxxus : Maldraxxus defends us from forces that threaten the Shadowlands, or at least, they once did.  Now they are plagued by infighting and an imbalance in power.  We have few allies there, but those that remain, we must maintain.  Go there, give them aid, and help them reunite the houses such that the armies of the undying may defend us once more.  Without them, we are but one invasion from complete annihilation."
7752,"Enacting Immediate Justice : There are likely many in attendance who wish me harm.   I trust you have done your job in determining which house has been working with Andrei?  Once they are named, I trust you will enact immediate justice."
7753,
7754,"Humble Gatherer : Before your soulbinds step foot in the coliseum, you must challenge your first opponent.  There is a tradition to this, as with all things. You will need to gather specific items, then bring them back here to fashion armaments to help execute your challenge.  In the case of your first challenge, you will find the materials throughout Bastion. Return to me once you have collected everything, then we will continue."
7755,"Focusing the Eye : The combination of grief and rage you have harvested is sufficient for your needs. Most likely.   If you insist on seeing this ill-advised endeavor through, use the horn at the Terminus Platform, where the River of Souls flows upward to Torghast. The energies there are most potent indeed.  The presence of your golden allies should draw the Jailer's Eye. I only hope this does not prove to be the end of you. I hate to see an investment wasted."
7756,"A Cry From the Heart : <The voice of Ysera emanates from the scroll as you read the words.>  <name>,  There is a matter of great importance which requires your help. Please meet me at the Heart of the Forest as soon as you can."
7757,
7758,Lost Research : We have uncovered a promising source of Korthian research. Previous Archivists hid knowledge within repositories that were then placed within the rift.  I fear that the repositories are no longer safe and that shades of that realm will consume them. It is imperative that we secure this research before it is lost forever.  Use a Repaired Riftkey to enter the Korthia Rift. Recover the Korthian Repositories.
7759,"A Call to Ardenweald : Ardenweald is one of our closest allies, and to them we ferry some of the most powerful souls.  Should the weald fall, the devastation that would be unleashed could destroy us all.  We must aid the Winter Queen. It is the will of the Archon.  Go now, and provide support to the Night Fae."
7760,"Vault of Secrets : You've helped us regain a semblance of order, Maw Walker, but the outlook is dire.  The Jailer's forces have launched an all-out assault upon the ruins of our vault at the outer reaches of Korthia. Clearly the Banished One seeks something of value inside.  The vault's defenses activate when the structure is threatened, so getting inside won't be easy. But we must recover whatever the Jailer is seeking before his Mawsworn do.  I've enlisted the aid of a necrolord who can help open the vault."
7761,"Prison of the Forgotten : I discovered an interesting item off the Warden you killed in the tower.   Best not to ask how I know what you do and where you do it within the tower. Let's just say, I have my ways.  But this key could lead to something interesting within Torghast. Or something horrible. Most likely horrible.  You ought to explore a bit and see what it unlocks."
7762,"Observing Battle : It is clear that you mortals thrive on conflict. Members of my cartel have a keen interest in observing your combat prowess in action.  You seem to be fond of squabbling over contested ground. Observing such territorial behavior would benefit me, and could provide opportunities for you as well.  Can I count on your participation?"
7763,"Trading Favors: Halls of Atonement : The mechanisms by which each land of the Shadowlands operates are quite intriguing. Yet, I have always held a particular fascination with the venthyr of Revendreth.  How they siphon souls of their sins, storing them in strange stones, and dredge up minions from the muck that surrounds them -- it is all quite novel.  They keep their secrets close at hand, however, and will not willingly part with information. I offer trades for any of their tomes you might come into possession of."
7764,"A Paladin's Soul : Bolvar Fordragon has seen visions of a vault hidden deep within Torghast where the Jailer keeps souls he deems valuable.  Uther was struck down by a mourneblade. When such a weapon is wielded with rage, it can shatter a soul into fragments.  If the Jailer holds a part of Uther's soul, it cannot be fully mended until the lost piece is restored.  Take this attuned shard to Torghast, $p. It should guide you to the vault's location.  Find the lost fragment of Uther's soul so that he can be made whole."
7765,
7766,"Halls of Atonement: Your Absolution : The depravity outside of these halls is only a whisper of the true horrors being committed under the Lord Chamberlain's guidance inside the Halls of Atonement.  If you truly wish to curb this corruption, you must dethrone the imposter that you installed here.  Atone for your own mistake. Kill the Lord Chamberlain, so that we may begin to restore permanent order to this place."
7767,
7768,"Challenges in Maldraxxus : Maldraxxus is a land of conflict and strife. There is little better place than to test yourself against the might of the Shadowlands.  There, you will find warriors that are bred on combat, honed by the sword and hammer, tested in arenas and battlegrounds.  Crash into them like the felling of a great branch, let them see the might of Ardenweald is no less terrifying."
7769,
7770,"The Great Vault : ""The Purpose."" Utter nonsense, of course.  The attendants are so blinded by devotion that you could drop stewards on their heads and say the Purpose told you to do so, and they'd ramble on about it being a mysterious portent of some grand destiny.  Kah-Toll is the most insufferable of all. I've been observing that vault for quite some time, and I assure you it has never opened for anyone.  Of course, if someone COULD open it, I'd pay handsomely to know what's inside."
7771,"Challenges in Bastion : Our allies in Bastion have long served the cycle of the Shadowlands, delivering souls in need of our services.  Yet, within their ranks, doubt has grown and festered. If this continues, we will all pay.  Their loss of focus shall not be allowed to continue. We will punish their wandering hearts.  I accuse these souls of sins against the Shadowlands. Mete out justice in the name of Revendreth."
7772,"Trading Favors: Sanguine Depths : The generals of Revendreth are outfitted with only the finest arms and armor, procured by Sire Denathrius in his unquenchable appetite for power. In terms of profitable trades and exchanges, he has been a shrewd partner in trade to us.  It would please me greatly to see the return of some relics that were traded in a way that benefited him far more than us. There are few things more insulting to my kind."
7773,"A Secret Never Spoken : The first reagent listed in the scroll is a secret never spoken.  Well, that's easy. I know who has tons of secrets! Watcher Vesperbloom, our resident snoop. She keeps the Wild Hunt informed of any nefarious behavior that takes place in the forest.  I know she'd be willing to give us a secret to save Qadarin's soul from dissolving in excruciating pain.  I'll have Thiernax meet you wherever she's hidden them. It'll keep his mind off what's happening to his husband."
7774,
7775,"Disrupting the Cycle : The shacklers in the Tremaculum are an awful sort.  Souls are tortured there until they turn malevolent. They are then outfitted as guards so the cycle can continue.   If you wish to slow the rate at which the Jailer raises his armies, start at the source.   Disrupt the cycle at the Tremaculum."
7776,"Interrupt the Interrogations : Shhh... quietly!  The invaders will kill me if they find me here, just as they have killed so many others!  <Roh-Suir points frantically in the direction of the Mawsworn.>  They're torturing the Archivist!  You must find a way to rescue her. We cannot allow the Mawsworn to learn all that she knows!"
7777,"Eye of the Scryer : Evading the Mawsworn's scryers requires powerful magical countermeasures.  The prime reagent? A luminescent eye, pried from the skull of a scryer recently shaken from its trance.  The scrying ritual begins as we speak. You will, of course, be compensated only for an intact eye.  Restraint is advised in its procurement."
7778,"The Ember Count : Theotar's brilliance is undeniable, but far too many overlook the ingenuity of his dredger helpers, Gubbins and Tubbins.  Look to that ridge beyond us. The Jailer's forges over there are spewing out Soulsteel Embers.  We could accomplish many things with a mirror made from them...  Gubbins has already crafted a special parasol, capable of shielding its wielder from any falling embers.  Meet him by the forges and obtain some of those Soulsteel Embers!"
7779,"A Call to Bastion : The denizens of Bastion are a key component to the cycle of power here in the Shadowlands. Without them, we cannot replenish our ranks, and the forces of the Jailer will grow ever stronger.  They have their own troubles in these times, as well. Today, we must look without, and aid our allies.  Travel to the golden fields, and rid them of their foes.   Only with allies do we stand a chance against Denathrius."
7780,"A Few Bumps Along the Way : This territory is strategic to our defense, we can not allow these abominations to force our retreat!  Seize control of two of the locations marked on your map. Defend them from enemy attack till the flag is planted and the location captured."
7781,"A Valuable Find: Theater of Pain : The Theater of Pain in Maldraxxus is a brutal place, where only the strongest survive.   With the houses so fiercely in competition with one another, it is considered a great point of pride to house a champion with a winning record.  As such, the house lords often outfit their contenders with powerful arms, armor, and trinkets. Often these are storied items that have been passed down through many battles.  I would very much like to see such an item."
7782,
7783,"The Battle of Ardenweald : With the betrayal of Sire Denathrius, and the absence of the Primus of Maldraxxus, we must assume that the Winter Queen is the Jailer's next target.  And we won't let anyone take her sigil!  Ardenweald has endured much, but it is a realm of great and mysterious power. Things aren't always what they seem.  We'll use this to our advantage, no matter who comes for the Queen!"
7784,
7785,"Things Best Kept Dark : The leader of Cartel So represents a grave danger to the Shadowlands, Maw Walker.  Her name is So'leah. She seeks to assemble an artifact of the First Ones and use its power for selfish ends.  Pieces of the relic are said to be hidden on your homeworld. Brokers have never before found our way there. But if So'leah does, then Azeroth too is imperiled.  We must intercept her.  There is cargo nearby marked for Cartel So. Perhaps the manifest will give us clues as to their leader's whereabouts."
7786,"No Friend of Mine : Tools. I cannot work without my tools!  Famos, my former apprentice, stole them all when she went to the Forsworn.  It breaks my heart. She had so much promise.  She must be stopped."
7787,
7788,"Missing Relics : Thanks to your aid, I have been able to recover more research regarding the lost relics from the vault.  I have gone over the codex and believe there are more relics within Korthia that can still be recovered.  These were sealed within chests that I believe have been scattered in Korthia during the initial attack.  I have set up the missing relics in here. Commit them to memory. They must be recovered."
7789,Diviner's Rune Chits : <Inside the pouch is a single rune chit. It rotates and flips as if moved by an unseen hand.  Runes vaguely reminiscent of the Vrykul language are delicately carved into the stone. On the back of the chit is an indication that it is part of a set.>
7790,The Caged Bird : Remain quiet. We must not attract attention.  Many of my sisters have already been lost. It will soon be my turn to perish in that witch's vile ritual.  Release me from this cage and I can see us both to safety. Keeper Odyn must be warned of this foul betrayal!  The Mawsworn called Kjellrun holds the seal that can free me. You can find her gloating in the nearby hall.
7791,"Untangling the Sigil : The Primus's sigil is bound together with the magic of memory. It reminds me of something you have encountered before.  You made an ally of the Runecarver, that poor soul trapped in the bowels of Torghast. He took those memories you found and helped you forge them into weapons and armor.  Perhaps he can separate the sigil from this tangle of memories.  It's our best chance to secure the sigil. But the way will be perilous."
7792,Night Fae Assault : The Jailer's forces  have been caught off guard by our attack. We shall overrun Perdition Hold and defeat his champions at the Altar of Domination!  We need your help Maw Walker. Assist our forces on the battlefield!
7793,"Death Motes : I have a task for you, Maw Walker.  Souls deemed suitable for service among the Mawsworn are broken down to their barest essence. The resulting creature forms a black shade, devoid of all individual will.  It is a tragic end.  I wish to better understand this process--what is it about a soul that causes this transformation?  Fragments of broken souls rain down across Ruin's Cradle. Bring me some of them, so that I might learn more about our common adversaries."
7794,"The Jailer's Share : The Mawsworn's torturers have a talent for misery.  The suffering they inflict often produces more stygia than they can collect. The excess floats loosely in the air, left to drift into the abyss.  I have fashioned a conduit specifically for capturing the leftover stygia. You can borrow it if you wish.  There are a handful of prime gathering locations throughout Calcis. As you'll be using my conduits, we can split what you find upon your return."
7795,
7796,Searching the Grove : It is clear that a struggle took place here. I fear that Kivarr may have been taken by the Drust.  I scouted the surrounding area before you arrived. Eventide Grove has been overrun.  The Drust cannot have taken her far. We may yet be able to find her. I just pray that we are not too late...
7797,"The First Move : While the covenants labor to defend the Shadowlands, the Jailer has not sat idle within Torghast. It seems he intends to set the next phase of his scheme into motion.  Polemarch Adrestes has brought us disturbing news from Elysian Hold. He will recount what he witnessed once you arrive.  Make haste. I fear that time grows short."
7798,"The Nathrezim : The Medallion of Wrath is more than just a powerful artifact. In the hands of a nathrezim it could be used to shape this realm to their dark purpose. What is more, while they hold it we are denied the ability forge a new sigil.  They already nearly destroyed the Ember Ward with their reckless schemes. I will not have my medallion used for their ends.  Come, let us get it back."
7799,
7800,
7801,"Tazavesh: Raiders of the Lost Artifact : It looks like you may need to show a bit of force once more, my dear friend. Tazavesh security will not let us simply walk in.  But So'leah needs to be stopped. If that requires a bit of physical... persuasion... then it is a necessary evil.   Bring some friends. I have a feeling the security here has tricks up their sleeves."
7802,"Ember Court: Mortal Reminders : For a reasonable renumeration, Ta Cartel can supply the decorations you require.   Restocking unique and intriguing items is an important aspect of doing business. As you can freely return to your own world, you can provide me some new and exciting products to offer.  Your world has captured the imagination of many of our clients. I have buyers looking for some specific things native to Azeroth."
7803,"Researching Korthian Relics : <You find a torn book regarding relics that were being kept within Korthia.  A name written within its pages begins to glow: ""Roh-Suir.""  The book spins in your hand and points in a direction while Roh-Suir's name pulses.  Perhaps this Roh-Suir could help you discover more about the relics you've found.>"
7804,
7805,"Tracking a Wild God : Dis be a dark place, <name>. We gotta track down da spirit who be trapped here.  Me tink me can pick up its trail... but dat be all dis ol' shadow hunter can do.  If me be tryin' ta fight wit' ya, da threads dat be tyin' me ta Azeroth might break. Den I gonna be stuck here, too.  C'mon. We best be moving."
7806,"Rebellious Souls : Please hear us out, Maw Walker.  When Margrave Gharmal launched his attack on Bastion, there were many, such as Emeni and myself, that opposed his actions.   Fearing dissent, Gharmal removed many souls from their constructed bodies and imprisoned them. Emeni escaped the prison, but most did not.  Help us free the other souls, and we can build you an army of constructs far greater than any that serve Gharmal."
7807,"Mirror, Mirror... : We have what we need to get you through, <name>.  My medallion lies on the other side of the mirror. Once through, my medallion will be there... somewhere.   Please be careful. My mind may be weakened, but I do remember working with the Accuser to protect the crypt's interior.  I should be able to tell you everything about this place, but I am afraid that just is not the case anymore."
7808,"Return Lost Souls : Souls continue to pour into the Maw.   Their anima, our very lifeblood of the Shadowlands, is going with those souls to fuel the Jailer. You rescued me from the Maw. I see no reason you cannot pull more souls from that abyss.   Bring souls you rescue from the Maw to me and I shall see them put to better use. At least in Revendreth they have a chance of redemption."
7809,"No Soul Left Behind : Do you hear the cries of tormented souls trapped in Gorgoa?  The twisted river of souls flows before us, swelling with cruelty and the torment of undeserving victims.  Our brave regiment of druid spirits led the charge into the river to seek out those lost souls, but I fear many have instead joined in their suffering.  Summon your courage and take my cradle with you into the river. Load the lost souls you find onto the cradle, then order the cradle to come back to me."
7810,"The Forge of Bonds : To best serve the court and the forest, you must bond with another fae.  It is an ancient ritual, one which will grant you great strength to face the many trials ahead.  Flutterby below will guide you further."
7811,
7812,"Glimmerflight : This so exciting!  Come, another test is in order. I can hardly wait!"
7813,"RSVP: Droman Aliothe : I serve my Queen and abide by my oath to guard this hollow and tend the spirits it encloses.   Once, I might have enjoyed your Prince's party, but I am no longer suited to revelry.  My world was destroyed long ago, and perhaps I have lost the joy I felt as its wild guardian. I would dearly like a reminder of my old home.  I have heard those strange traders, the brokers, have unusual objects from other worlds.   Perhaps they have something from mine?"
7814,
7815,"Observing Victory : The threads of fate have called you to the realm of conflict, $p.  Will you rise to the challenge issued by your territorial rivals? Will you face them in combat and emerge victorious?  If you allow me to observe your victory, I will pay you your worth."
7816,"Stop the Inquisition : The Lord Chamberlain's inquisitors still torment the poor souls trapped under their care.  You must put a stop to their wicked deeds!  Speak with Archivist Fane, whom you worked with before to defeat an inquisitor, to acquire the sinstone of another inquisitor in the halls.  With their sinstone, you will be able to shatter that inquisitor's defenses and lead the charge to defeat them.  Bring friends, $p. Many of the inquisitors are far too dangerous to approach alone."
7817,"They Grow Up So Quickly : I know what you're thinking, but I have these gormlings completely under control!  I picked up a trick or two at the venthyr's Ember Court for suppressing and controlling these troublemakers.  If you wish to use their power to aid our battle, I will loan you my staff. With it you can choose a gormling that can be ordered to feed on the corpses of our enemies and grow in strength and size.  You won't need many. Gormling grow quickly."
7818,"Hooking Over : I've made some solid hookshots and grapple points. Don't worry--if they hold my weight, they'll hold yours!  They can get us across the chasm to the next anima conduit.  I'll go on ahead and wait for you. No telling what might be lurking over there.  The sooner we get the anima conduit working, the sooner we get into the vault and claim the Primus's sigil."
7819,"The Threads of Fate : It is my duty to observe the strands of fate. The wondrous possibilities that the Purpose lays before us.  Fate flows around you, mortal. It shifts. It changes. But I have stilled its movements to offer you... a choice.  You may journey through the Shadowlands in the same manner as those who came before you have done.  Or you may choose a different path. One that lets you forge a bond with a covenant now, and move freely through the realms of Death to forge your own destiny.  What say you, mortal?"
7820,"Stalking the Warrens : So, they are creating magical beasts deep within the Warrens. Their power is... substantial.  Maw Walker, I must trust in you to handle this. While I can provide insight, in combat I must admit your prowess exceeds my own.  Hunt the beasts that they train to hunt us. Show the Mawsworn that we too can bare fangs."
7821,"The Weak Link : This ought to be enough to break the bonds that hold your newfound ally.  <Ve'nari pauses for a moment.>  Before you do so, I offer a word of warning.  No creature imprisoned in that place should be trusted. Tread carefully, mortal.   After all, it would be a shame to lose so valuable a business partner."
7822,"Reawakening : If you can retrieve my memories, I can help you. At least I believe I can.  Then, perhaps, we can help each other."
7823,"A Damned Pact : Yes... I begin to remember. Power. Power with a purpose. That is what I can offer.  Runes. Runes are the key. I've recalled some of them, but to infuse them into your equipment, I require my hands.  Well, one hand would suffice. Both would be better.  Find a way to free me from my bonds, mortal. Then I can offer the power you seek. After that, freedom... and perhaps the downfall of the one who bound me."
7824,"The Sweat of Our Brow : Ah, an outsider! You are perfect for this task.  The spriggans are known for their mischief. They have been cursing our tools and supplies and trapping unsuspecting workers!  Like our curses, they must obey the rules. You'll need shimmerdust for baskets, thread made of gossamer for harps, and minty fresh breath for the soulwebs. How odd.  Good luck and let the Lady of the Falls know when you're done. She'll be delighted to hear it!"
7825,"Clip Their Wings : The skies are dark with Helya's kyrian followers. If we do not thin their numbers, Zerekriss and our aerial allies may have difficulties pushing forward.  I've noticed that the Mawsworn often use magical chains. We could turn their equipment against them and tear them down from the sky."
7826,"Break It Down : I've seen the ritual. It's... terrifying.But the altars seem to be the key. If only I had my pyrotechnic powder, I could blast them to bits!<Primrose is silent for a moment, then takes a deep breath.>If you could get the powder and guard me, we could blow up those altars.I stashed as much as I could in our dwellings. They don't seem to care any more.You don't have wings, but a pinch of faerie dust should work for a short time.Let's do this before I change my mind!"
7827,"The Penitent Hunt : You will descend upon these poor souls. Remember, you are helping them and Revendreth through the terror you bring. When a soul is filled with fear, their resistances to our methods falter.  The Master has requested that you hunt the Accuser yourself. But we must prey upon some of the others first.  I will be able to guide you through your first hunt."
7828,"Trial of Ascension : The Forsworn threat is ever looming, and our forces are dwindling. Now, more than ever, we need more Ascended.  Our generous Archon has blessed us with a portion of our anima stores to ascend our top aspirants to join our forces.  Kleia is amongst the chosen, and thus must complete her final trial.  As Pelagos is not yet prepared to ascend, I request you be Kleia's partner for this process. It is arduous and should not be embarked on alone.  She must bear her first soul."
7829,"An Abuse of Power : The souls have suffered tremendously under the Lord Chamberlain.  We venthyr subjugate souls to our will so that we may lead each to the absolution it requires--willing or not.  The Lord Chamberlain, however, has been using our relics and rituals to abuse the souls under his authority. He binds the souls to their sinstones, perverting their very essence!  Use these ritual chains on the abused soul and subjugate it to your will. We must attempt to absolve it."
7830,
7831,
7832,"A Shady Place : Existence is not a simple thing, $p. It is layers upon layers of realities.  The Jailer's traps are pulling our troops into one such rift, hidden from normal sight.  I have obtained an Unbalanced Riftstone. It will give you the ability to enter the rift and destroy the traps keeping our troops trapped inside, before they are lost forever.  After you've destroyed the Rift-Veiled Traps, exit the rift and pull the trapped soldiers back into our reality."
7833,"Power of the Colossus : I have another task for you, Maw Walker.  Deep within Perdition Hold, there lurks a menacing mechanization known as the Soulsteel Colossus. It must be destroyed before it wreaks havoc upon us.  Travel to the Hold, and then across the bridge into the Altar of Domination. There, casting its vast shadow upon The Maw, you will find the Soulsteel Colossus.  Shatter the colossus and bring me its power source as proof of your victory."
7834,Venthyr Assault : The Jailer's forces  have been caught off guard by our attack. We shall overrun Perdition Hold and defeat his champions at the Altar of Domination!  Your help is needed Maw Walker. Assist our forces on the battlefield!
7835,"The Big Squeeze : So our missin' blue got 'imself dragged off to the big squeeze. Fortunately I am wise to the prise.  We'll soft foot it in like we work there, find your moose, avoid eye contact with the fangs, and chisel out of 'ere like we're masons. Follow?"
7836,
7837,"Something Old, Something Used : Want new luckydos? Chordy is best at finding luckydos!  Want to go look around with Chordy?  <Chordy looks at you pleadingly with his large eye.>"
7838,"The Netherstar : <You recognize this relic from the Archivists' Codex.  The power source is nearly empty. However, it could be restored with exposure to raw, unfiltered anima. Nearby fissures would do the trick.>"
7839,"RSVP: Rendle and Cudgelface : I heard about the prince wanting Rendle and me at 'is court. I aim to please 'im an all, but Rendle says 'e  haven't got proper ah-tire.  Says 'e needs a sootible hat, maybe somethin' posh that hints at 'is inner depths.  He says the only good hats are: Red Noggin Candle, or one a them Fae Revel Masques. Or mebbe a Pink Party Hat, or a fancy Crown o' the Righteous."
7840,"A Valuable Find: Necrotic Wake : Once in a rare while, we find ourselves in possession of an object of exceptionally cryptic origin. These objects allow us a brief glimpse into the realms beyond our comprehension.   It may seem to you that I speak in riddles, yet so much of this realm is shrouded in mystery, even to us.  There are others that have sought to unravel the history of this realm. Should you happen upon one of their works, I will offer you a trade of exceptional value."
7841,"An Unfortunate Situation : Laurent, mirror maker to the Master. Pleasure to meet you. Excuse my disheveled appearance. It appears I've found myself in a most unfortunate situation.  I was attempting to travel on royal business when my mirror sent me to this wasteland instead.  Not a moment after I arrived, a band of exiles ripped the clothes right from my back, making it impossible for me to traverse this unforgiving terrain.  Assist me and I will endeavor to create a mirror which will allow us to escape this wretched place."
7842,"Planned Demise : Our defense is tenuous at best, but the enemy is still hesitant to attack.  As long as they fear us, they won't be probing our defenses.   You must keep the pressure on the enemy.  Attack their positions all along our line."
7843,"Dead Drop : Ta'nla requested something very... specific... on behalf of a client.  The kyrian have been working on a new type of centurion they call an aquilon. I sent some of our trade specialists to retrieve the prototype in question, but they have yet to return.   Until I have the item, there is obviously no way I can ship it to Ta'nla. Perhaps we can help one another.  If you can locate the aquilon and bring it here, I will help you reach Tazavesh."
7844,
7845,"Rituals of Night : Tyrande's time grows short, so we must act quickly.   <Ysera frowns in concern.>  We had hoped to gather more Night Warriors, but we will have to proceed with who we have and hope it is enough.  <Ysera shakes her head, then looks more resolute.>  Before we can begin, we must finish preparations for the ritual. Please bring these last few items with you and meet us at the grove."
7846,
7847,"Loa Rescue : We be here for Ashamane, but me sensin' loa bein' tortured up ahead. Three of dem, if me be right.  Me don't know who dey be, but dey don't belong in da Maw.  We need ta be bringin' dem back ta Ardenweald, too!"
7848,
7849,"The Two Sides of History : You mortals always say that history is written by the victors. But in the Shadowlands, I have found that to be untrue.  Everyone has their own version of events. I would like to know them all.   There was an author of history books who made her abode in Revendreth's  Darkfall Tower. She wrote from the venthyr's perspective of various incursions and battles alongside the Primus.   If we could find copies of her works..."
7850,
7851,
7852,"Pride or Unit : You have made great strides with our pride. I hope you found value and fulfillment in working with the larion.  The time to meet with Pelodis has come. You must decide whose way of life is more rewarding, and which you would prefer to pursue."
7853,"Oozing with Character : Apprentice! I've been looking for you.  Kevin has been such a wonderful helper in our experiments, I'd like to train my other oozes to be able to assist as well!  Can you take Plaguey with you and test their ability to infect organic life forms?"
7854,"Into the Reservoir : With anima in short supply, Baroness Draka has tasked me with carefully managing our reserves as they are needed.  You may deposit any anima you recover into the reservoir here. Be assured that the Necrolords will defend it at all costs."
7855,Thread of Hope : <Gertie Jr. looks up at you with hope. Perhaps you can help get her to safety.>
7856,
7857,"Mal'appropriated : <The dreadlord catches your eye, wishing to speak. You glance at your companions. Moonberry urges you forward with a mischievous grin. You step as close as you dare.>  Free me from this prison, mortal, and you will have my favor. I am aligned with powers greater than these pathetic puppets or their masters. They have no concept of the true forces at work.   All I need are the sigils of binding which hold me. The rest I can... take care of.  Free me, and you will be granted untold power."
7858,
7859,"Outplayed : Now we can strike down their leader, friend.It just so happens that I have a large pouch of puffpetal powder right here. Why don't you take it and toss a few handfuls around the workshop floor at the top of the falls? If they are still there, I imagine they will have an... unfortunate reaction.While you do that I will gather the other elders and make our way to Glitterfall Basin. Speak with the Lady when your task is done."
7860,"Sinfall : I knew you could be counted on. Revendreth's revival relies on forging pacts with those outside of our realm.   The Prince never had any doubt that you would agree to join our cause. He summoned the Court of Harvesters in anticipation of your arrival.   Renathal awaits you within Sinfall, where you will be presented to the court."
7861,"Plaguefall: Knee Deep In It : There are many in the House of Plagues who survived its destruction only to later fall victim to the plagues released in the explosion. Margrave Stradama herself was driven mad from a mixture of twelve different airborne poxes!  These dangers still remain and spread out from the ruins, infecting new victims daily.  I need you to travel into the ruins and recover samples from the victims there."
7862,"Lost Records : Some of the record keepers fled to this mountain when Korthia was pulled into the Maw.  I see no sign of them, but they may have left records behind.   Take this beacon. I fashioned it using information from the previous record keepers you rescued.  It will lead you to any intact records that are on this mountain."
7863,Lakeshire's Last Stand : There's no time to evacuate... not if the Scourge are here!  Board the windows! Get everybody inside! Our only hope is to hide.
7864,Bulwark of Divine Intent : <Your familiarity with the Archivists' Codex confirms that this is one of the missing relics.  Archivist Roh-Suir has a spot for this shield in the Reliquary of Remembrance.>
7865,"Drust and Ashes : The Drust encroach upon the Grove of Awakening, <name>!  We must fly in defense of Ardenweald!"
7866,"The Search for Baine : I dare not step inside that accursed tower myself, of course.  While I cannot tell you exactly where your comrade is being held, I offer a gift to assist you.  Use it inside Torghast. It should take you somewhere near your missing ally. Baine Bloodhoof was his name, yes?  Either that, or you'll end up trapped within the tower's ever-shifting halls for all eternity.  But those are the risks one must take, I suppose. Best of luck!"
7867,Broker's Bounty: Lord Azzorak : A powerful dreadlord named Lord Azzorak is hampering the efforts of the Cartel in Korthia.  Anyone who exterminates this evil will be rewarded.   Use caution. Azzorak is a powerful foe. You may require several allies to slay him.
7868,"Through Glass : The mirror frame rests at the bottom of Redelav Hall. Kleia and Pelagos wait there.  With these shards, I can piece it together.  We will go through, grab the sinstone, and go face the Countess. Let nothing stand in our way."
7869,"Spy vs Spy : Nathrezim. Dreadlords. The Unseen Guests.  Call them what you will, they are a race that was crafted to be the greatest collection of spies and infiltrators in all of reality, once upon a time.   Their intrusion has underestimated three things. Kael'thas Sunstrider, Baroness Vashj, and <name>!  I have brought a tool Kael'thas and I used detect nathrezim when we served under Illidan. And I am the matron of spies!  Let us hunt these intruders down."
7870,"Her Will, Inflicted : I feel myself drawn across the double bridges to the west...  Lysonia must be there.  Come, <name>. We must confront her before she can escape again. Who knows what she plans."
7871,"That Darn Fox! : You! You there!  I, Clarion Song, need your assistance. Yes, yes, give yourself a moment to bask in my glory.  <Clarion Song gives you a moment.>  Done? Good. I need you to catch a troublesome vulpin kit. He is positively barbaric! Running amok, causing havoc, ruining my beauty rest! He's using a concealing charm to make himself invisible, but I know it's him!  Make yourself useful and catch that kit!"
7872,"Filling the Tanks : <The containment pack appears to be intact, albeit empty. Perhaps refilling it with the appropriate mixture of liquids will render it functional once more.  Slaying the correct combination of slimes should provide all the fluid necessary.>"
7873,"Gates of the Damned : We need to prepare for the assault before we signal Zerekriss. Once it is in place, our allies will use death gates to assault the area.  We will need to summon the death gates on this side. Find strategic locations for them."
7874,"In Need of Assistance : The inhabitants of Korthia have been through much. Were it not for our arrival, the Jailer's forces would have rampaged through the remainder of the City of Secrets, leaving destruction in their wake.  To continue our efforts, we must assist those in need.  Heed the call of our allies, Maw Walker. See to it no stone is left unturned and no ally of the Jailer left alive."
7875,"Ages-Echoing Wisdom : Hmph. Even if I wanted to give her weapons, I cannot. My glade is under attack!Most of my people were driven out during the attack on the growthworks but a few of the elders stayed behind. Whether to delay the enemy or see the friends to safety, they are not here where it is safe.Each elder can perform extraordinary works and could make the weapons in no time at all. Rescue the elders and then we'll talk about using their talents for the good of Ardenweald."
7876,"The Al'ley Cat of Oribos : Ah, Maw Walker. I have a message.  An individual has a proposition for you, specifically. I know nothing of the details, only that they asked you meet them towards the back of the Idyllia."
7877,"Mantle of Mastery : You have done much to establish yourself as a promising acolyte. Your superiors have made it known that you are ready to be tested for your ritualist's mantle.   When you are ready, begin the Ritual of Ancient Summoning to call forth an elder spirit of Maldraxxus. Conquer the spirit, and prove your mettle!"
7878,"Slaylines : Gaining entrance to the Sepulcher is no easy feat, <name>!  Not only were guardians put in place, but an elaborate magical lock was created to seal the door.   To open the way, the two obelisks which control the lock must be fed anima. Fortunately, there are some empowered crystals in the area we can use for this purpose.  Locate the focus crystals and redirect their anima flow into the obelisks. Then the secrets of the Sepulcher will soon be ours!"
7879,A Unified Effort : You have made strong allies within your covenant as well as the others within the Shadowlands. This bond is why they have decided to loan aid to our cause.  They are ready to fight alongside us as we begin our advance into the Maw.  Each covenant will strike at the Jailer from a different area. Help them scour this treacherous land for any who serve Zovaal so that we may put an end to his growing influence.
7880,"Book of Binding: The Tormented Sorcerer : <You hear a muffled voice speaking from within this book, interspersed with crackling static. Though the utterances are mostly unintelligible, you can make out the repeated request to recover azure pages.  Flipping through the volume, you note that many of its pages are missing.  If the pages were retrieved, the book could be returned to the Archivist and reassembled.>"
7881,"Rebuilding Faith : The Forsworn are lost, <name>.  They are like ghosts, haunting the Temple of Loyalty. Nowhere else to go. Leaderless, purposeless, abandoned.  We must show them that there is a path forward.  Let me accompany you into the temple. Allow me to talk to them, speak to their sensibilities. Perhaps we can convince them to give Adrestes's new path a chance."
7882,"Following the Trail : I got a bad feelin' about dis, mon.  Wildseeds don't just go missing... especially da kind wit' powerful loa in dem! Even da bad eggs like Hakkar and Dambala be protected by da Winter Queen. Someone... or someting... must be stealin' dem!  But why? Dey weren't even ready ta be reborn...  Search da area and see if ya can pick up da trail. Missing loa be bad for business... and Bwonsamdi be in enough trouble wit' da boss already!"
7883,
7884,"The Spear of Kalliope : The Spear of Kalliope is finally in my grasp!  With it, I will lay waste to all the Forsworn's enemies. Now behold while I take my prize!"
7885,
7886,Mysterious Soul Mirror : <A shimmering soul mirror draws your attention on Devos's corpse.  Peculiar that she would keep one on her person. Perhaps Thenios will want to see this.>
7887,"New Opportunities Await : Going somewhere in a hurry? Ah, yes. You, Maw Walker--you would not happen to be venturing to explore the new, mysterious mass within the Maw, would you?  I do wonder what secrets it holds.  Perhaps there is something we can do to help one another.  If this is of interest to you then let us continue our discussion. If not, move along. I will find someone else to do the job."
7888,The Endmire : Oi! You.  Not sure what landed you in the Endmire but I need your help.  See these torches? It's my gig to keep 'em lit. But it ain't like they runnin' on flint n' tinder.  My stash of infused rubies got hauled off by some devourers when my back was turned. Can ya find 'em before we both get ate by one of these horrors?
7889,"Covenants Renewed : Our efforts were focused on preventing the Jailer from shattering the barrier around the Maw and invading the rest of the Shadowlands.  Instead, he expanded the Maw itself to envelop Oribos and claim the Aribiter's sigil.  I do not fully understand what we witnessed atop Torghast. But the Primus certainly does.  It is time to enact his contingency plan. The covenants will arrive with their sigils shortly.   Inform the Primus that we are ready to begin."
7890,"The ""Unwelcome"" Guests : Chelra, I mean Nal'ragas, would not have been working alone. We must assume the worst, that not all of our friends and allies are who they seem to be.  It will take time for the Court of Harvesters to render our detection ritual. While we do so we will be exposed. I ask that you use the techniques you employed at Dominance Gate within Sinfall to root out any nathrezim within our ranks.   Good hunting."
7891,"Sourcing Your Own Materials : I can aid you in crafting many pieces of equipment for your soulbinds.  Though they may only equip one at a time, each piece grants a new ability that they may not have without it.  This time you must source your own materials from around the Shadowlands. When you have collected them, return to me and we can create the footpads!"
7892,"The Spires of Ascension : Our task is not complete yet.  We may have pushed back the Forsworn here in Elysian Hold, but it was only a distraction to split our forces.  The Archon and the Paragons fight to retake the Spires themselves.  We cannot hesitate to aid them in this time of need!"
7893,"Broken Wings : You help me? Really? Wow!  Look at me. What am I?  I have beak. Feathers. Scaly toes. I am bird, yes?   But birds have wings. And I have arms. Why I not have wings?   I broken. I can not fly.  Larion nearby, flies so gracefully. I must study her wings up close!   You help me?"
7894,"Pool of Potions : I shall teach you about the Pool of Potions. The potions we create here have a variety of beneficial effects.  Kill the slimes in the surrounding ruins and collect the Oozing Ingredient: Viscous Oil they may drop. Each slime can produce a great quantity of oil, so you'll only be able to carry one slime's worth at a time.   Deliver this oil to the Pool of Potions and toss it in."
7895,"Tower of the Damned : We know little of Torghast. However, Fatescribe Roh-Tahl claims there is work that must be done there.  He believes there is a path for you to reach this place... and that someone there requires your aid.  Do what you must to reach Torghast and aid anyone who is within."
7896,"The Medallion of Dominion : Laurent speaks the truth. We must not delay.   This mirror is our entryway into the heart of Maldraxxus.   Together with Kael'thas, we will find Kel'Thuzad and rip the Medallion of Dominion from his undeserving grasp."
7897,"Unity : A unique construct has chosen to join us, but its unethical creation leaves it most unsettled.  The fusing of fragmented Kyrian souls within this construct, gives it pain and suffering. We must find a way to harmonize these souls so they can live together in peace.  Create the Bindings of Wellbeing and bring ease to the Soulfused Construct."
7898,
7899,"Your Personal Assistant : Here in Hero's Rest, we have a beacon that is the fastest way to draw the Polemarch's attention.  It has been quite some time since we have used it, and I am afraid that it has fallen into disrepair.  I authorize you to receive a steward companion during your stay here in Bastion.  I will call for some to convene here. You may select one to aid you."
7900,"Trouble in the Banks : Ah, be welcome in my glade, Maw Walker. You are safe here.While it is regrettable that Sorcha must wait for her weapons, it is of paramount importance that I keep my charges safe. I will do anything to prevent them from suffering as the rest of Ardenweald.Perhaps I could ask a small favor of you. I have not heard from the gatherers at the Banks of Life in some time. Would you mind checking on them to make sure they are well? I would go myself, but I must deal with Sorcha. Seek out Foreman Thorodir."
7901,"The Garden of Night : That should take care of things out here. Now we must tend to the inner garden. Once we're done, I'll sort out my recalcitrant husband.  Hopefully, any remaining spriggans will have cleared out on their own after hearing us dispatch the others."
7902,
7903,"Fruit of the Gods : You like sweet fruit?   Stewards grow juiciest Purian. It special fruit! You find it many places in Bastion. It used for many things.   Eat for nourishment.  Give to bells for blessings.  Give to stewards for treasure.  You find, I show you how!"
7904,
7905,"A Suitable Opponent : The opponents you train against in the coliseum are not physical beings, but rather manifestations of such.  Your first opponent is one you and your soulbinds have met numerous times before -- the Ascended Kalisthene.  Asking another kyrian to be your opponent in the Path is a great honor, as it tells them that you have much to learn from them.  Go to Aspirant's Awakening and use the cores to summon Kalisthene by calling back to your first introduction. It is as ceremony states."
7906,"A Token of Lost Love : My sister, Alexstrasza, lost her prime consort, Korialstrasz, towards the end of our war with Deathwing.  She has loved many in her long life, but none as deeply as he. I know in my heart she loves him still.  Find Alexstrasza in the Vermillion Redoubt and ask for a token of her lost love. It will surely prove a powerful reagent for the counter-curse."
7907,"The Chosen Few : I have need of more val'kyr to join Danica in the battle to come. <name>, you are granted the honor of choosing the most worthy.  The strongest will present themselves in challenge at the Circle of Glory. Fight hard, <class>, and do honor to your weapons."
7908,Lang Family Wood-Carving : <Your familiarity with the Archivists' Codex makes it clear that this is one of the missing relics.  Archivist Roh-Suir has a spot for this wood-carving in the Reliquary of Remembrance.>
7909,"No Friend Left Behind : I would care for nothing more than to serve as navigator again, but my dearest friend suffers. I cannot stand to abandon him.  I can feel Twigin now. He struggles against the binding web of the spiders who once served us. More victims of this senseless conflict...  Though it pains me to say it, you must slay our spiders and gather their caustic venom. You can then use it to free Twigin.  If not out of empathy, rescue him for the sake of your plans. My skills will be useless without his direction."
7910,"A Swift Intervention : The Drust just took Kivarr away. They said they were going to sacrifice her in one of their rituals!  If we hurry, you may still be able to save her! I've seen where the Drust keep their sacrificial altar... it's scary, but I can take you there!  There's no time to waste! Follow me!"
7911,"Rule 1: Have an Escape Plan : Many doomed souls suffer within the Maw. You must be careful if you do not wish to join them.  Your Soulkeeper can hold a small number of souls until you return to your covenant. But that will be of little benefit if you do not survive this place yourself.  There is a substance, stygia, that is found on some creatures within the Maw. The stronger the soul, the more stygia they have.  Collect some of it for me and I can fashion it into many things you will find quite useful."
7912,Unstable Explosive Orb : <Your familiarity with the Archivists' Codex makes it clear that this is one of the missing relics.  Archivist Roh-Suir has a spot for this device in the Reliquary of Remembrance.>
7913,"Rule 6: Concealment is Everything : I have made a startling discovery, <name>.   Do you recall how the captured agents of my cartel were taken to the Beastwarrens?   The Mawsworn seem to think they possess a means of tracking me. And now, strange new runes empower the Jailer's hounds.  Clearly, we cannot have that.  This new cypher will grant you solace from the screeching in the Beastwarrens. Brave its caverns and secure those runes for inspection.  If we are to counter their effects, I must know how they work."
7914,"Blinded By The Light : $p, Sire Denathrius must be stopped. The anima he is stealing from the Shadowlands is weakening the bonds that seal the Jailer within the Maw. That must not happen.  Time is short so we must strike quickly. I would like for you to head up to the surface, into that accursed Light, and align as many mirrors as you can find to the focusing mirror atop the portcullis.  We will shine a light on Castle Nathria so bright no venthyr will wish to step forth from that fortress to challenge us."
7915,"Maelie, The Wanderer : I can't thank you enough for finding Maelie! You know, I think she's just a little bit more than I can handle.  Would you mind watching over her? I think she's really taken a liking to you!"
7916,Shadow Slicing Shortsword : <Your familiarity with the Archivists' Codex makes it clear that this is one of the missing relics.  Archivist Roh-Suir has a spot for this shortsword in the Reliquary of Remembrance.>
7917,"The Seat of the Primus : This cannot be a coincidence. It is clear that your runeblade is somehow connected to the Seat of the Primus.  I will not pretend to know the Primus's agenda. But I would not be surprised if he left behind a way for the worthy to open the door to his sanctum.  Draka will bring you to the Seat of the Primus. If you hold the key, mortal, then our victory is all but assured."
7918,"Looting the Looters : <The Mawsworn was carrying a Korthian artifact.  It's unclear what the enemy wants with such relics, but you suspect the attendants in Keeper's Respite would want to see them returned.>"
7919,
7920,"Mushroom For Improvement : The mushrooms are under attack! I need your help, or we risk losing it all!  Some fae wearing strange masks came in and demanded to gain access to the rings. When I told them they were closed due to the drought, they attacked me!  I'm too weak to fight back now, and I'm cut off from the center ring. These fae have destroyed so much, but there is something we can do.  Sprinkle some of these spores on their corpses so we can regrow the rings. Even when slain, our enemies can still serve Ardenweald."
7921,"Rule 6 Addendum: Save Me At Any Cost : You! You, there! Wait!  You are the infamous Maw Walker, yes? I have heard much about you.  Please, help me! My compatriots have been drained of their essence. The Mawsworn are using it to fashion their foul runes.  One of them bound me here, and I am sure to be next on his list. You must slay him in order to free me!  I can make it worth your while. I have collected a fair amount of stygia during my time in the Maw. It is yours, all of it, if you save me!"
7922,"Well, Tell the Lady : <Thorodir breathes a deep sigh of relief.>That's that, I'd say. The Banks are largely safe now, thanks to you. We can handle the rest of the cleanup on our own now.The Lady of the Falls will want to hear of your success here. Why not go tell her the good news?"
7923,"Replenish the Reservoir : Hail, Maw Walker.  As our influence over Bastion grows, so too does our need for our most precious resource--anima.  We must replenish our reserves. Scour the realms for all that you can find and return here with the anima.   With our precious reserves replenished, we can direct the anima wherever it is needed most.  Go in service, <class>."
7924,"A Call to Maldraxxus : The forces of Maldraxxus have long defended the Shadowlands from threats outside of our lands.  Now, they face their greatest threats from within. The balance of power between the houses is broken. It has led them to assault us, and others.  Their problems are many, our solutions are just.   Travel to Maldraxxus and slay those that would do the Shadowlands harm, providing shelter to your allies when you find them."
7925,"...Even The Most Ridiculous Request! : A fan of the competition, are you? Perhaps you would like to be more than a mere spectator?  I will give you a small task... one that not only benefits me, but that also gives you a chance to meet some of the storied competitors here.  As you can see, our three remaining houses have sent champions to attend the Contest of Conquest. Talk with them and attend to what needs they might have."
7926,Cipher of Understanding : <Your familiarity with the Archivists' Codex makes it clear that this is one of the missing relics.  Archivist Roh-Suir has a spot for the cipher in the Reliquary of Remembrance.>
7927,"Silk Shortage : We are running short on silk! We use it for so many things, like instruments, weapons, and tools. But our supply has dried up!  We are in desperate need for fresh silk.  Our main hub of silk production is in the Gossamer Cliffs. If you could, seek out Caretaker Lillythistle, and see what the holdup is!"
7928,"A New Pack : <The gorger is more than fully grown, rivaling most of the other devourers in the area. It clearly wants to stay with you, but it appears to be uneasy straying too far from the world eaters. Maybe if you take one down together it will not hold as much sway over the gorger.>"
7929,"Torghast, Tower of the Damned : My allies were taken into the Tower of the Damned, and so we must follow.  I do not think we must venture deep into those halls, which is good as I do not believe either of us is in shape for a fight like that.  Come, let us find our way to one of the most dangerous towers in all of existence."
7930,"Special Formula : You may think I'm naturally gassy, but it actually takes a lot of work to build it all up. This is all the result of a nice coating of Pox Nodules.  Help me refresh my coating.  Just get me near the absorbing pox and I'll pull the nodules right off his slimy skin."
7931,"Soul Survivor : I knew when you helped me in the Etheric Vault, that you were a just and worthy leader.  I have come here to offer you my help and services in your efforts to bring Maldraxxus back into balance.  Please, build a construct for me, and allow me to help you as you have helped me."
7932,Surveying Secrets : Each of the covenants have provided their own specialists in their areas of expertise. A few of them have taken to the field to scout this unknown land.  Speak with them. They should all be keeping a report of their survey. Return them to me.
7933,"Overcoming the Trial : These new footpads can give Pelagos the edge he may need to defeat Kalisthene.  Return to the Path, <name>. Equip Pelagos with these footpads and overcome your opponent.  It may take a few tries, but all trials do.  Go in service, and in glory!"
7934,
7935,"Find The Way : I apprenticed at the Stitchyard for many eons. I even worked in the Body Banks with surgeon Stitchflesh to design Emeni's last construct.  If we gain control of the Body Banks, we will have the parts necessary to rebuild Emeni and create new bodies for other souls we rescue.   Lead us to there and we'll see if we can get it operational."
7936,
7937,"Anima Salvage : When we ferried souls to the Arbiter, we never thought this would happen. We watched in despair as they were cast into the Maw, one by one, then by the hundreds and thousands.  Souls that have been devoured, consumed, their anima lost to us. Return to us what you can."
7938,"Into the Unknown : Come to pay old Marasmius a visit? I have a special task for you.One of my shoots has found a strange place, a place even I've never seen before.I'm not entirely sure what's in there or if it's even safe. But that's what my trusty mushroomancers are for!What do you say, <name>? Up for an adventure?"
7939,"Silk for Ardenweald : It's clear that we may not be able to consistently supply Ardenweald with silk. But there is something that will help.  Take Gertie Jr. and the silk you collected from the other silkstriders back to the Heart of the Forest. There, she will be safe, and perhaps grow up into a silkstrider as grand and beautiful as her mother!"
7940,The Last Place You Look : I came here hoping to locate the Fatescribe or something to help me find him.  Evidence shows he was here and survived a Mawsworn attack. The only other place I haven't looked is a meditation chamber on the opposite side of the ruins.  It's too dangerous for me to head back into the Seeker's Quorum alone. Could you help me?  I must find the Fatescribe. It's a matter of great importance.
7941,"The Sweetest Tribute : Purian good to eat, yes, but better to give.  You find locked Silver Strongbox near steward statue. Give Ripe Purian fruit as tribute.  Then get nice surprise!  You try?"
7942,"Aiding Ardenweald : Ardenweald has long been one of our closest companions in the shepherding and nurturing of souls. Now they are beset by many foes, and we will not allow them to fall!  Make haste to their forested lands, and with the blessing of the Archon upon you, serve a glorious purpose. Stand with them in their time of need, a gilded shield, a reminder that they are not alone!  Bastion stands with them, and with us, they will never falter!"
7943,"A Master of Their Craft : If we wish to get a travel network up and running, we'll need a master mirror maker in our employ.   I've heard rumors that one such tradesman has landed himself in the Ember Ward. I am sure it won't take much cajoling to convince him to join our ranks.   Head back into the Ember Ward and find this master mirror maker."
7944,"Into the Flame : I know the curse of which you speak. Dark magic that possesses the mind of the afflicted.  Long ago, the Drust were ruled by a sorcerer king named Gorak Tul. It was he who twisted our rituals and set us on the path of death and domination.  You will need to claim a portion of his power to break the curse.   Take this fetish to Gol Inath and temper it in the Flame of Oblivion. But beware... it is a vile place, and danger lurks among its shadows."
7945,"Let the Anima Flow : Tal-Galan briefed me on the situation and explained the vault's workings. As well as any scholarly type could, at least.  First we need to ensure the vault is getting power. They use underground conduits to feed it anima.  The attendant says that one of these conduits is tucked away in a cave in Scholar's Den.  You get me there and I'll find a way to fix it. Just watch my back while I figure out how these Korthian devices work."
7946,"Tied Totem Toter : Hope you've caught your breath.The totem is now a big, tasty beacon to all the nearby gorm. They're going to want to eat it and you're going to be carrying it!We need to rehome the smaller ones. If they stay here they're just going to get big and angry again. If you can drop off a few groups of them outside the Banks of Life we can make sure they find their way to more balanced feeding grounds.Let Thorodir know when you're done. I will let him know the plan."
7947,"Full of Surprises : You continue to surprise me Maw Walker, your presence here is most unexpected!  Since we are both here, I believe we should work together.  The Jailer has a vault full of valuables, somewhere in this rift.  Locate it for me, or bring it here to be opened and we'll share the wealth together!"
7948,"The Tithelord : With his army defeated, the Tithelord is vulnerable. Now, he has but a small contingent to protect him. Let us strike him down decisively.   He draws power from these anima wells, keeping it all for himself. If you can hold his attention, I can not only empower you to defeat him but also disable the wells.  Speak to me when you are ready to begin. When the time is right, the baroness will lead our new recruits into battle."
7949,
7950,"Into the Vault : The destruction here is... overwhelming.  <Tal-Galan quietly utters a prayer.>  Anima flows into what remains of the vault. We should now be able to enter.  Once inside, I will work on recovering the Primus's sigil.   Please show reverence within the vault. It is a sacred place that few are allowed to see.  Even the prophecies did not foretell that a living mortal would gaze upon the secrets within."
7951,Gorak Claw Fetish : <Your familiarity with the Archivists' Codex makes it clear that this is one of the missing relics.  Archivist Roh-Suir has a spot for this fetish in the Reliquary of Remembrance.>
7952,"Dread Tidings : The threat the nathrezim pose to our forces must not be underestimated. They are cunning, rivaling the best veterans of the House of Eyes, and we do not know their full plan.  Among the venthyr there is one whose wrath scourged the nathrezim from the Shadowlands for many thousands of years.   I ask you travel to Sinfall, seek out Prince Renathal, and deliver to him this missive. I shall send one of my own spies, the Baroness Vashj, to meet you there. Make use of her experience with the nathrezim."
7953,"Setting Sabina Free : Release me. Please, you must do so. I cannot linger in the Light any longer.   This unease, it's so... familiar, but it will pass. I will feel myself once again, once I have returned to the shade.  I'll stay as still as silence while you work the lock."
7954,"Tazavesh: A Hard Bargain : Ah, my work looks marvelous on you. You are the very image of legitimacy!  And now that I've provided you with my talents, you shall provide me with yours. Seek out my business associate, Fe'tajid, at the Gilded Landing and offer him your assistance.  I look forward to hearing of your success."
7955,
7956,"The Accuser : It is time to hunt our final prey, the Accuser.  Anima drought or not, her sycophantic adherence to sacred ""rituals"" flies in the face of the Master's will. I can't wait to see the fear in her eyes."
7957,"Good News, Everyone! : Come, friend. Let us be rid of this foul place.  No doubt your comrades will be eager to hear the news of the defeat of the Eye. I will bear you to them.  Give the word when you are ready to depart, <name>."
7958,A Rousing Aroma : <Sabina is unresponsive. Her exposed flesh cracked and blistered. Perhaps something with a pungent aroma will rouse her.>
7959,Construct Part: Indomitable Hide : <This could be used to construct a powerful abomination. Perhaps Rathan will know how we can use it.>
7960,"How to Become Forsworn : The Forsworn have taken control of Kalliope's Rest and are looting its antiquities. They must be looking for the Spear of Kalliope, a relic of great power.  Their numbers are far too great and we are no match. Perhaps there is another way?   A small group of aspirants is removing artifacts from the shrine. If you gather uniform pieces and an insignia from them, we can get you inside the shrine unnoticed."
7961,"Mnemis, At Your Service : Greetings, I am Locus-Keeper Mnemis and I would be delighted to assist you.  I recall that you are trying to access a particular memory. Due to the contents, that memory can only be viewed within the Vault of the Archon.  In order to gain access to the Vault, you must collect offerings for the two guardians who watch over it. I have hidden these offerings from the Forsworn, as they are not authorized to enter.  The Forgelite Prime is the only one among you who can grant authorization. How convenient!"
7962,"Tears of the Damned : To anchor the instrument to the Maw and make it capable of the effect you seek, it must be imbued with the raw, unfiltered agony endured by the souls trapped in this cursed prison.   Sorrow is abundant here, and therefore simple to obtain. You need only travel to Gorgoa. The damned shed copious tears that fall as crystalized grief as they are swept along the River of Souls.  Be careful that their sadness does not overwhelm you."
7963,
7964,"Putting A Plan Together : While Maldraxxus pushes the main gate, we can take the side gate with the help of our Centurions.  The remains of many Corrupted Centurions taken by the Jailor litter this area. Their parts could be used to build new ones to help in the assault.  See if you can locate the parts we need to build a new Centurion."
7965,"Vaunted Vengeance : So you are from my baroness's home world? It must be a special one to breed such powerful individuals.  The necromancers here have already begun preparation for Mor'Bitan's ritual. We should capitalize on their progress.   Three necromancers act as the ritual's architects. Should we acquire their drafts, we could modify them to suit our purposes.  Collect the plans... and feel free to savor your victims' torment."
7966,"Before the Dawn : We shall need all we can muster if this day is to be ours.  Gather them all. The Watchers, Bearers, Centurions, and Collectors. Tell them that their Archon calls for them.  Our Paragons will clear a staging ground at the Court of Elation for the final assault."
7967,"Mirror to Maldraxxus : I've received word that Laurent's made substantial progress with his repairs.   Once the mirror has been restored, we can realize our efforts to recover the final medallion.   Head to the ramparts and see if his work is near completion."
7968,"Collection Day : Now, we can collect the gorm gris for Guardian Kota!  Once the gormlings have eaten something, we can 'encourage' them to give it back up. What they produce, we call gorm gris!  My Gormherd Branch should encourage them to do this safely.   Go on, give it a try on good ol' Gloober first.  What has me worried is how the other gormlings might behave. They have been acting so strangely lately!"
7969,"Ease of Passage : Korthia is ripe with opportunity. Look at all of these intriguing objects.  In anticipation of such wonders, I have come prepared. Let us find a suitable location and establish a more permanent connection between this place and my refuge.  Our work together is not yet finished."
7970,"The Chains of Command : If we must hold a position so near to the Jailer's lands, we need to provide some assurances.  Vyraz and Helya have retreated within the walls of Desmotaeron. They have grown lax in their expected safety, which provides us with an opportunity.  We will take them by surprise. Strike swiftly and without mercy, and perhaps we can cut the heads off those snakes."
7971,"The Ladder : Within the Theater of Pain, <brother/sister>, legends rise like cream to the top.  Listen to me, <brother/sister>. If you have the courage to step into that sacred arena, you're going to face the greatest threats in all of existence! The cards will be stacked against you, but only those who can work together will emerge as champions.  Gather your team and meet this challenge head on! Enter the Theater of Pain and defeat the opponents within! Prove that you can rise to the top!"
7972,Ring of Self-Reflection : <Your familiarity with the Archivists' Codex makes it clear that this is one of the missing relics.  Archivist Roh-Suir has a spot for this ring in the Reliquary of Remembrance.>
7973,"A Calling in Bastion : Our forces are weakened by doubt and our temples are under assault. If we are to aid the rest of the Shadowlands, we must begin here, in Bastion.  Travel the golden fields and root out evil wherever you may find it. In time, we will rebuild our forces and our anima stores, and stand tall once more.  Today, you walk the path of courage--it is your calling. Show our people that doubt will not fester here."
7974,Enigmatic Decrypting Device : <Your familiarity with the Archivists' Codex makes it clear that this is one of the missing relics.  Archivist Roh-Suir has a spot for this device in the Reliquary of Remembrance.>
7975,"A Helpful Hand : It takes but a simple act of necromancy to animate a hand. Unfortunately, since you will be in closest proximity, you must be the one to command it.  When you are ready, I will reanimate the hand. Once you have control, use it to pull the lever at the end of the hall.   Couldn't be simpler, right?"
7976,"The Veiled Market : Let me guess... Ta'oku sent you my way, yes?   <Ta'meri looks at the coin you offer.>  So, you seek travel to Tazavesh. Not something we'd typically offer an outsider, but since payment has been accounted for, it would be my pleasure to assist you.  Step aboard, and do remember to keep any appendages inside the craft at all times. The currents of the In-Between can be fickle."
7977,"Ring Repairs : The damage wrought here is severe, but it can be reversed.  My master is weakened by all this destruction, but mushrooms are difficult to completely eradicate. By restoring power to the rings throughout the grove, we can strengthen them once again.  Take this beacon. Use it near a damaged mushroom in a ring, and watch how quickly nature can heal its wounds."
7978,"Convoy of the Covenants : A new sigil for the Venthyr would require all seven medallions to forge.  The Primus was correct. The person we need is the Stonewright. Her grievances against the Unseen could fill a library and she holds the last of the medallions we need. I believe you and I are long overdue in convincing her to join our cause.  I will make the arrangements. We shall go properly this time, with gifts and diplomacy.   You should warn Chelra, she will want to arrange an escort."
7979,Dredging up a New Look : If ye look around the muck pool I am sure you will find an armor dye. It might be nice to have the option to dye me belt a different color.
7980,"Crypt Crashers : There's one more thing I forgot to mention. Apologies, <name>.  The mirror, once complete, is inherently cursed by design.   You need to locate my Death Lotus Powder. It was in one of the crypts in Archivam... I cannot recall which one.   I'm afraid you may have to brute force this one, <name>."
7981,Feral Shadehound : <The runed armor husk pulses with power and seems to struggle for its freedom.  Release your feral shadehound and bind it to you.>
7982,"Witch's Satchel : I sent Ara'lon to steal a witch's satchel from the Drust... a dangerous task from which he has yet to return.  The Drust's nightscreamers carry many reagents we need to perform the ritual. We cannot proceed without one.  You must go to the Oaken Assembly to procure one of their satchels... and find Ara'lon, if you can."
7983,
7984,"Hidden Mirror : If Renathal is going to put the Harvesters' medallions to use, he's going to need a conduit to focus that power. Denathrius's corruption taints the forges of Revendreth. Our best option is in Bastion.  As denizens of Revendreth, Bastion will not allow us to enter through Oribos.   We will need you to activate a mirror hidden away there long ago. Take this.  We concealed it at a rarely used site, the Veiled Enclave. There should be no one there, especially with the drought."
7985,"Meet the Queen : <name>, we need only one more piece to complete the Crest of Ascension.  Eons ago, our Crest was originally crafted with the assistance of the fae. Deep within Ardenweald lies a portal they maintain to ferry souls back to their worlds. It is a source of great power and the final key to rebuilding the Crest.  Seek out the Winter Queen in Ardenweald and plead our case. We've already sent Pelagos ahead as our envoy to arrange for your meeting."
7986,"New Sigil of the Kyrian : With a future of kinship and devotion secured for Bastion, a new sigil is born to represent our path forward.  Please report all that you have done to the Primus. When he is ready, we will deliver the sigil to him.   Let us hope he can use it to thwart the Jailer's plan and save the Shadowlands."
7987,"Mix, Mingle, and Meddle : Once the party begins, I will be occupied with a plethora of nobles that wish to cling to my side.   This is why I need you to mingle. Speak with the attendees and see if you can determine which house is conspiring against me.   Be warned, invited guest or not, these aristocrats can smell an outsider. You won't receive a warm welcome from everyone."
7988,"Opening the Maw : The Jailer has gained another sigil, and his forces actively assault Oribos.  Bolvar Fordragon and Draka of Maldraxxus suggest taking the fight to the Jailer.  To do so, we need a way for their forces to safely come and go from the Maw.  This was considered impossible before you arrived, but now I believe we have a chance.  I must examine your anima to see if this is truly what the Purpose wills."
7989,"Explore Torghast : Baine is safe, but our other allies are still prisoners of the Jailer. They remain in grave peril.  Torghast is a constantly changing place, shifting according to the will of its master. It may be impossible to track them through normal means.  Enter its cell blocks and see what information you can find. Seek any clue that might lead us to our missing friends, and bring it back to me."
7990,"Blooming Villains : Something stinks, traveler. The air to the west is rotten with malice.Shimmerbough has long been a peaceful way station along the Path of Rebirth. The faeries there delight in revelry and celebration. But now their glade has fallen silent.Scouts bring reports of the strange masked night fae. I know little other than that they are a threat.For the sake of Ardenweald, they must be eliminated. Slay any you encounter."
7991,"Report to Oribos : Ardenweald has withstood the unrelenting force of the Maw.  But it was still not enough.  Return to our allies in Oribos. There must be an answer for this loss, and action taken."
7992,"Citadel of Loyalty : The medallions, the source of magic the crown focuses, are still bent to the will of Denathrius.   Forge cannot solve this. Citadel of Loyalty can.  Taken over by the Forsworn in recent times. If we can get the crown to the temple, we can break the loyalty to the medallion's former master."
7993,"Book of Binding: The Mad Witch : <You hear a muffled voice speaking from within this book, interspersed with crackling static. Though the utterances are mostly unintelligible, you can make out the repeated request to recover crimson pages.  Flipping through the volume, you note that many of its pages are missing.  If the pages were retrieved, the book could be returned to the Archivist and reassembled.>"
7994,
7995,"Trading Favors : Welcome, friend.   I can see by your garb that you must have quite a storied history. Many unique relics befitting of one that has traveled the worlds and vanquished many foes.  There are those of us that find great value in such things, and would willingly part with our own valuables for a taste of what you may find.   Let your curiosity guide you to the dark hallway across from the cookpots in the next room. Down there, you will find answers."
7996,
7997,"Tough Love : Heavens! Kala has flown off with Korinna's Allaying Crook!  I saw her fly into her den to the west. I must warn you, she can become very protective when she's in there. Please be careful, but do not be afraid to give her some tough love. She is exceptionally resilient.  Here, take her slobber ball. It's her favorite and may help to distract her."
7998,"Suggested Reading : Greetings. You must be the new aspirant everyone is talking about.  I thought you might like to learn more about us. There are three tomes that would serve you well as a starting point, but they are not currently in the library.  Aspirant Leda was the last to hold ""Worlds Beyond Counting."" Aspirant Ikaran has yet to return ""The Infinite Treatises.""  It seems ""Bear Witness: The Watcher's Code"" went missing some time ago. I would search the village.  Once returned, you can read them at your leisure."
7999,Empowering Equipment : The research you find can unlock many possibilities.  One such avenue is improving some equipment that you may find within Korthia.  Speak with my assistant nearby. He can use our research to restore this equipment to its former power.
8000,"Growing in Power : Wonderful news, <name>!  You have gathered enough Anima. The Queen is now able to empower the Heart of the Forest!"
8001,"The Path of Ascension : With the anima you collected, we can once again start up the Path of Ascension.  The eternal training ground of the kyrian, the Path is an ancient tradition and favored amongst many of the kyrian, aspirant and ascended alike.  The Hands of Courage, Apolon and Artemede, have stepped up to lead this tradition. Once you herald the Path's rebirth, speak to them to learn more."
8002,Ember Court: Tubbins's Tea Party : Theotar need tea for party? Tubbins make best!  Special tea. Very special. Only I can make. Recipe need very good water from garden place. Good pool on special floaty island!  You go get and Tubbins makes tea!
8003,"Infusing the Wildseed : Dreamweaver tells me of a ritual to quell the wildseed's nightmares... but it will require anima.  A soul named Proglo lives beneath this tree, gathering anima for the grove's caretakers to use.  His mortal life came to a violent end, and his soul has been skittish ever since. He will not respond well to your current form.  I will grant you the ability to assume the soulshape of a fox. Approach Proglo in your new form to gain his trust and ask for his anima."
8004,"Ember Court: Guest RSVPs : Prince Renathal will wish to invite certain guests to each Ember Court.  In the future, we'll be able to adjust the guest list to make it easier to please everyone in attendance. But, we should follow the Prince's lead on this first one.  Work with Lord Garridan and Lady Ilinca to ensure that Cryptkeeper Kassir is able to attend and returns his RSVP.  If you haven't met Cryptkeeper Kassir yet in your adventures, you may need to introduce yourself before he'll listen to you."
8005,"Soul Led Astray : Uther was a being of justice on your world. I am sure it was quite surprising for you to see his fate here, following a leader who embodies what he stood against in life.  I believe you should witness this memory firsthand. Take it to my soul mirror. View the memories within."
8006,"The Unseen Guests : Dreadlords.  Of course. Of course they would come back now of all times. I half suspected they returned during the drought.   I was not entirely convinced you were not one, the first time I saw you. They have gotten more clever over the eons since they fled Revendreth.   But not clever enough... I think.  Come, Maw Walker. Follow me and do not make a fuss. Keep your weapon ready. The envoy you brought is not as well intentioned as you might have thought."
8007,"Into Torghast : The bond to your covenant is growing stronger, <name>. Good. The power lies within you to venture into Torghast and rescue our allies.  You saw Baine Bloodhoof while assisting the broker in the Maw. Perhaps this Ve'nari knows a way to breach the Jailer's tower and find the chieftain.  When I peered into Torghast once before, you stood at my side. I believe that connection will allow me to see through your eyes as you navigate its torments.  Seek out Ve'nari and request her aid, Maw Walker."
8008,"Build-A-Bomination : We need to get to work, every soul here needs a body.  We have the parts to build a body for Chordy. Chordy is a great scavenger, rebuilding him could allow us to find more construct parts easier.  Would you help me to rebuild him?"
8009,"In A Bad Light : I've heard about the chaos in Revendreth. Reports of exiles driven mad and burned in the Desiccation.   The very thought of all that suffering fills me with the urge to do something about it.  If you are headed there, please let me accompany you. I simply must help as many as I can!"
8010,"Ember Court: Divine Desserts : Recipes very important. Must not be lost!  I learn new foods from many mortals, add to my book. Best way is taste some of thing so can know what is good. You teach recipe to me this way and bring me right ingredients so I cook too. Then taste yours, then taste mine. Helps me learn.  I bring desserts to Ember Court.  Fair, yes?"
8011,"Invitation for the Countess : The Countess, Harvester of Desire.  Her wits are sharper than most swords. While I have never seen her carry a weapon, you must assume she is never unprotected.  Her mansion mirrors my own, on the Northeastern side of Castle Nathria. Her dominion was that of the Castle Ward, and it is her authority that keeps the nobles in line.  She will appreciate a secret message. I will send a dredger ahead with a plan to infiltrate her party. Meet him on the Bridge of Temptation. Good luck."
8012,"A Soulbind In Need : Pelagos is my Soulbind. He is my brother, my closest friend, my mentor, and my student. He knows me completely, and I him. It is a bond stronger than any other.  That he now struggles is a torment to me, but I am forbidden from intervening. An aspirant must succeed or fail on their own merits, or the trial is forfeit.  I am bound by this law... but you are not.  Please bring Pelagos back to me. This will not be his last trial. Not when he may finally have a chance."
8013,"The Third Fall of Kel'Thuzad : The time has come to purge Maldraxxus of treachery.  Our armies are rallied. Our allies stand ready. The machine of war is in motion.  We must win this battle, or all of the Shadowlands will be lost."
8014,"Foraging for Fragments : Forgive me. I don't mean to appear ungrateful, but my mirror fragments are missing.  I shouldn't be surprised, really. They're quite powerful and I'm sure the miscreants out here would be happy to get their hands on them.  Nonetheless, I will not let this deter me.  The Master sends his stone servants to smash any mirrors erected in this ward, so we should have no trouble finding fragments nearby."
8015,Prove Your Worth : You must prove your worth to us again <name>.  We have not forgotten your betrayal.  Yet we know you seek penance. This task should prove your willingness to rejoin our ranks.
8016,"A Grave Chance : First you'll need a vessel to house anima and a way to expel it. I happen to possess such a device, which I'll be pleased to give to you.  For a price, of course.  You recall Zovaal's Cauldron, I trust? The denizens there were forged in unholy fire. Assuming their anima is of a similar nature, it should be able to melt even the metals of the tower.  With my device and their anima, I believe you can achieve your goal, Maw Walker."
8017,"Charge of the Covenants : Thanks to the efforts of you and other heroes of Azeroth, the covenants have grown strong. But we can no longer afford to wait for the Jailer to make his next move.  The way to the Maw is open. Our forces stand ready.  The covenants await your signal, <name>."
8018,"Choosing Your Purpose : Each covenant is vital to the Shadowlands. Though they have been isolated and divided as of late, the Purpose depends on the success of their efforts.  All of the covenants must bolster their strength to face the threat of the Banished One. But your contributions cannot be divided. They must be focused upon a single path. Other mortals may make a different choice.  Speak to your potential allies. Then make your choice at the map of the Shadowlands before me."
8019,"Common Ground : Now that we have a stronghold from which to operate, we need to begin the next stage of my plan to wrest control of Revendreth from the Master.  We must convince the Court of Harvesters to convene. We must not have them come here, though. It would be suicide.  Go to my old fortress, Darkwall Tower, and place these banners at the four most distant points of the tower. This will ensure the power of the Harvesters and the Master will not be able to interfere with a neutral meeting."
8020,"To the Vault : Thanks to the Bonesmith's repairs of both conduits, anima should now be flowing to the vault. That gives us a chance to get inside--assuming we can reach it.  Our Maldraxxi allies have wrangled transportation to get us to and from the vault. I suggest we make haste.  If the Jailer's minions obtain the sigil of the Primus before we do, it won't just be Korthia that suffers. All the Shadowlands may be forfeit.  Let's go, Maw Walker. Our forces will be awaiting us."
8021,"Callous Concoctions : I witnessed your success with the Pool of Potions and I think you could be of help. Within this larger pool, we create more dangerous mixtures!  There are three different oozing ingredients we mix together in different combinations to create violent creatures. When enough ingredients have been added to the pool, the mixture takes shape and a creature will emerge!  Bring any combination of these ingredients, Mephitic Goo, Viscous Oil, or Miscible Ooze to the Pool of Mixed Monstrosities."
8022,"On De Other Side : Ay dere, <name>... It be your ol' friend, Bwonsamdi!  I hear ya be workin' for da Winter Queen. Seems ya be makin' quite a name for yaself!  Ardenweald be in grave danger, but da Queen... well, she be too proud to deal with ol' Bwonsamdi.  Ya wanna save da forest, mon? Come visit me on da Other Side.  I gonna be waitin' for ya..."
8023,"A Plague on Your House : Though the physical House of Plagues is lost, the knowledge contained within was not. There are survivors here that continue to research and develop new horrifying weapons.   In time we will restore the house and rise to even greater power, unleashing creations and plagues never before seen upon our enemies!  Perhaps you can help? Speak with survivors and see if any of them can use your aid."
8024,Sign Your Own Death Warrant : Ember Ward only for bad buds!  <Stonehead squints at you and shakes head.>  You not look like other bad buds!  Bad buds come with bad paper!
8025,"Fury Given Voice : I will answer this attack upon my val'kyr with relentless fury!  You have a vital role to play in this, <class>. You will muster the courage that you have demonstrated this day to lure my Eye to battle.  But first, a simpler task ... the creation of the horn that will summon my wrath. Master Smith Helgar will guide you."
8026,"Tirna Scithe: A Warning Silence : The songs of Tirna Scithe have faded as the grove wanes, yet there is now silence. Droman Oulfarran's voice has not been heard in some time. The trees whisper of penumbral shadows, discordant songs, and dying roots. All is not well.  Friend of Ardenweald, travel to Root-home. Delve into the Mists. Remove that which threatens us."
8027,"Silence in the Stalks : Hmm. Well that's not... great. But no cause for alarm, yet!  It has been a long time since our ring withdrew from here, and we probably need to go to its source to get it to return!  Unfortunately, I haven't heard from the Chief Mushroomancer, Cortinarius, since the crisis began.  Please, find him and help us rejoin the rings! Head west of Dreamsong Fenn to the Stalks. You can't miss them... just follow the mushrooms!"
8028,"Victory in Our Name : With Helya and Vyraz taken care of, we have achieved a major victory against the Mawsworn today. It is also a showing of what the combined might of the Shadowlands looks like.  We should return to Korthia before something else arises."
8029,"Inform the Primus : <name>, return to Korthia and tell the Primus that the Winter Queen's sigil has been restored."
8030,"The Box of Many Things : Ah, Maw Walker, of course. Soon I shall be undone, claimed by this place forever. But you continue to walk its halls, unbroken!  It was my great aspiration to prevail with the help of this box. Sadly, I overestimated my own capabilities.  I trust I am not overestimating yours. Take the box. Prove yourself worthy of it."
8031,"In the Ruin of Rebellion : Well, here we are -- Sinfall.  Last I saw, the Master was dragging Prince Renathal and his most loyal followers here in a prison convoy. However, this is a forbidden place, wrapped in rumors and mystery. I heard it was once the workshop of Denathrius, where he performed dark experiments.  Intriguing to be sure, but we are here to find Renathal. Search below, but proceed with caution. I will send word for the Accuser to make her way here with what allies she can muster."
8032,"Collecting Dust : If I know the Countess, which I do, her sinstone will have stronger protection than mere keys.  She is quite fond of curses to protect her gateways. I am capable of creating a residue that should protect us, but it requires the petals of a specific flower you can find in Redelav gardens.  Collect the petals of these flowers so that I may protect us from the dangers to come."
8033,"Weapons of the Tremaculum : The venthyr of Sinfall do not waste souls, and her stoneborn do not waste armaments.  Retrieve the tools of our enemies so that we may repurpose them for our army."
8034,"On the Trail : In my visions, I witnessed Tyrande cutting through an endless storm of malevolent, nightmarish beings.  Up ahead... is that...? Yes. I believe it is the very place I saw.  Come. It may hold a clue as to where my mother has gone."
8035,"The Many Sins of Kael'thas Sunstrider : Kael'thas Sunstrider was on the verge of destruction when we rescued him from Castle Nathria.  Denathrius had infused Kael'thas with unimaginable amounts of anima, each bit carrying with it the sins of others.  It made his soul strong, but unstable--confused and pushed to the edge of its own existence.  Trust me when I tell you that Kael'thas Sunstrider has enough sins of his own.  Assist me in identifying which of the many sins heaped on his soul are truly his burden to bear."
8036,"Reinforcing Revendreth : Denathrius must be stopped at all costs. However, we've no hope of taking him out while his forces still control much of Revendreth.  If you are here to aid us, then there is no shortage of work to be done. Disposing of my father's many allies being chief among that work, of course, but any aid you can provide will be of use.  There is too much at stake for all the Shadowlands if we fail. I will see to it that you are handsomely rewarded for your efforts."
8037,"The Highlord Calls : A messenger from Oribos has informed us that Highlord Fordragon has requested your presence in Oribos.  It seems it pertains to the Maw... and the Master's plans, no doubt.  I suggest you heed his summons, Maw Walker. We must leave nothing to chance."
8038,"A New Age : With the final empowerment in place, our renewed Crest of Ascension stands bolstered by the might of not just Bastion, but all covenants.  Soon new Ascended will grace these halls once more as aspirants finish their long-awaited trials.  None of this would be possible without your aid, Maw Walker. The honor of activating the Crest at last is yours."
8039,"The Secret Ingredient : At times, even the most seasoned kyrian may have difficulty meditating. Recently, such problems have become increasingly common.  There is a special draught crafted from our purest waters that can be used to focus the mind. I believe it may prove useful in our work here as well, perhaps as a catalyst for more potent reactions.  Will you gather some? Move swiftly, for the liquid becomes unstable once removed from our sacred pools."
8040,"The Fourth Wall, er, War : It's time for the next act of your theatrical introduction: the Grand Drama Of Azereth!  Azeroth. Right. All these worlds are hard to tell apart.  Help set the stage, then come back here. You'll need to play a few other characters before you appear as yourself again.  Get a move on! We have a lot to cover!"
8041,"Smack and Grab : Bonetooths are the backbone of Maldraxxus's armed forces. Those that have been trained well are in demand amongst all of the houses.   I always need new bonetooths to train, but they can be rather difficult to collect.  Bring me some of the younger ones, and I will reward you greatly. Be advised that you may need to weaken them before you are able to capture them."
8042,
8043,"Observing War : Your appetite for conflict is a subject of much discussion here in Oribos, mortal. Members of my cartel have a keen interest in observing your combat prowess in action.  Though I understand a great war recently concluded on your world, I am told large-scale conflicts continue to play out in certain locations.  Any chance you could arrange a demonstration?"
8044,"Mirror Making, Not Breaking : Denathrius does not allow mirrors to be erected within the ember ward. His stone servants shatter anything that so much as glints.   I need you to remain vigilant as I make this mirror. I have no doubt that the Master's minions will try to stop us.   Are you ready?"
8045,"The Power of a Crown : We are ready.  The Court of Harvesters shall use the power of the medallions we have gathered thus far to locate the Medallion of Wrath. So long as they have not removed it from the realm we should be able to divine its presence.  This is not an easy ritual--the nathrezim specialize in avoiding detection. When you see the path, take it and move with speed.  And when you find them, wait for us before you engage."
8046,"Gifts of the Forest : These gorm have gone out of control! We need to stop them.I have a plan, but I cannot do it on my own. We lure the gormlings to the Banks of Life by using special totems that are drained of their anima. If you can retrieve the wood required for the totem, I can prepare the ritual.Take these pipes. Find the Culex trees growing on the banks and play a song for them. You will recognize them by their pale green leaves. The wood must be given freely for the ritual to work."
8047,
8048,"Gotta Hand It To Ya : Your power Maw Walker... it rivals even mine before Zovaal separated my body.  This is but a small part of my whole, but more than enough...  Allow me to aid you in your efforts against Zovaal.  In doing so my vengeance will be fulfilled."
8049,"Maw Manifested : Ya heard it from Mueh'zala himself... tanks to ol' Bwonsamdi. Dere be an ancient spirit trapped in da Maw. Me bettin' da Winter Queen gonna want it back.  Good ting ya been goin' down dere yaself, hm? Should be nice an' easy for ya.  Me gonna clean up da rest of da undead here. Meet ol' Bwonsamdi in Ardenweald when ya get back."
8050,"Duelist's Challenge : <Nadjia continues to parry attacks from enemy Mawsworn while she turns to face you.>  As you can see, we have our hands full here on the barricade.  I will hold the line while you challenge the champions of the Mawsworn army.  Defeat them in full view of their underlings.  No mercy, $p. Demoralize them."
8051,"It's a Trap : At last, I will have my vengeance!  I am certain Matyas will flee again if he sees me first so you will need to confront him on my behalf, friend. Then, while he's distracted, I will engage him.  At that point, your obligation as my second is a formality. You must assure Matyas does not dishonor the duel and cheat. When he inevitably does, I expect you'll help me defeat him.  He's just through the portcullis there."
8052,"Heavy-Handed Tactics : We need more constructs on the front lines, but we have no bodies, heads, or legs!   Rathan's making the best constructs possible with what we DO have... a lot of hands.  Don't ask questions!  There are enemies in Calcis that we need dead. Take the hands and kill things!"
8053,"Hunting Huln : Huln is somewhere in the area, but the Stonewright isn't letting anyone in to her territory because of the recent, ah, troubles with Dreadlords. The guards won't let anyone in, and they're kicking out anyone who doesn't look like they belong.  Luckily for Huln, Cudgelface and I came up with a foolproof plan!  We just need to look like we belong and then we can ask around and find Huln. Easy!"
8054,"The Court of Harvesters : Partnerships such as ours will be key to Revendreth's revival.   As Harvesters, we have the ability to extend our powers to mortals, though the decision must be unanimous. To that extent, the court has gathered and is awaiting your arrival.  Let's not keep them waiting."
8055,
8056,
8057,"A Meandering Story : <A quick glance at this heavy tome reveals flowery language and a plot that doesn't seem to go anyplace. At least not in the first few chapters.  There is some dirt on the cover, but the damage isn't too bad. This book doesn't seem to have found itself in too much trouble-- a bit like its plot.  Archivist Dreyden would probably be pleased to have his book back.>"
8058,Stitching Time : With the proper resources we can build a force of construct warriors greater than anything ever seen in the Shadowlands.  Visit Arkadia Moa and see if you can secure the resources we need.
8059,"Curses! : Oh, dear me, this is terrible! Just terrible!  I know precisely which awful curse afflicts that poor soul! But these damnable spriggans keep stealing my scrolls, scattering them all over and ripping them apart!   Now the falls are overrun with all manner of dangerous magic!  The spriggans have the pieces of the scroll you need. Gather them along with a binding from one of the major hexes, and you can put it all back together."
8060,"Halls of Atonement: Medallion of Pride : Our attempts at a parley were met with skepticism, at best. Acquiring the medallions may take more work than originally intended. However, not all hope is lost.   I do believe that we can win over many of the Harvesters, and for those we cannot, a more direct approach will need to be taken.   Lord Chamberlain falls into this latter category. His medallion must be taken by force."
8061,"An Infusion of Anima : Normally we would infuse the Lodestaff with energy from the Netherstar, another relic of note.  Regrettably, that is not an option. But, in a pinch, anima is an acceptable substitute.  Take the Lodestaff. Brandish it near recently slain devourers in the estuary below us.  The staff should draw in and absorb their anima."
8062,
8063,"Actions Speak Louder than Words : <The ash ghoul inspects you, checking your weapons and armor closely.  He shifts his eyes from you to your kyrian companions before checking back in with Theotar, who nods to him.  Alwin motions for you to follow him.>"
8064,"Offer of Freedom : Just as I was, some of the Briarbane venthyr you encounter will have been compelled to serve Matyas. They likely will not want to fight you, but will have no choice. Once they are injured, they may be willing to pause to see if one of the sinstones you recovered earlier is theirs.  Free those you can. The use of a sinstone to compel others isn't fair."
8065,"Beginning the Collection : Let us continue our work by retrieving the most important item of any scholarly study--the lost codex.  It will take some time, but as we continue our work the pages of this work will continue to grow and flourish, just as Korthia has itself for eons.  As for its location, it previously resided deep within the underbelly of Korthia itself inside the Cavern of Contemplation to the south.  We can only hope the Jailer's forces have yet to locate it."
8066,
8067,"Who is the Maw Walker? : Korthian prophecies foretell the arrival of a Maw Walker who can save us from disaster.   Perhaps this is that day. But perhaps not. I must test your anima to verify your claim.  If you speak the truth, then I have a solemn duty to empower your anima before we proceed."
8068,"The Eternal Forge : The Forgelite Prime has taken up the mantle of building our new Crest of Ascension.  No ordinary tools or materials will do. He will require Phaestus, Genesis of Aeons, Hammer of the First Forgelite. It sits at the shrine to the First Forgelite in the Eternal Forge.  The Forsworn have taken over this forge to create their own endless centurion army. You must meet Mikanikos at the forge, push back the Forsworn, and retrieve Phaestus for our own uses."
8069,"Sweep the Windswept Aerie : The skies over Korthia are a dangerous place.  Not only do the Mawsworn threaten our forces; the native creatures are also openly hostile. We must keep the skies safe for our own winged allies and beasts.  The source of the native flyers is the Windswept Aerie. Go there and clear the aerie of aggressive creatures.  Then, we shall have aerial supremacy."
8070,"The Lost of Teldrassil : I learned that Sylvanas burned Teldrassil. I felt my heart break for the night elves.  And that was only the beginning. We know now that the souls lost that day did not go to their intended rest.  But you have the power to begin to correct that, Maw Walker.  If you find yourself in the Maw, look for any of those lost.  Please, bring them home."
8071,Running a Muck : Bootus ready to smash devourer skulls.  Hop on.
8072,"Back to Him : Even with Humility's Guard in hand, if you are to convince Athanos to join the Path of Ascension once more then you must prove yourself a worthy adversary.  Enter the ring and wield the spear against him. Even with its power you cannot hope to defeat him, but it should be able to parry his mighty stomp.  Thwart his assault for long enough, and he will surely allow you to capture his memory."
8073,"Trust Issues : Ah, Maw Walker! Allow me to introduce myself. I am Ve'rayn. I deal with assets and liabilities for Cartel Ve.  I have heard that you are able to freely travel between Oribos and the Maw, a place of great interest to my cartel.  Would you mind if I ask you a few questions about it?  You will, of course, be properly compensated for your time and information. They are the most valuable of commodities, after all."
8074,"A Tea for Every Occasion : My dear $p! I knew you would arrive in the nick of time to save us all from the brink of boredom!  I was just telling Niya here about the time you saved me from the Ember Ward through the healing power of tea!  She is a bit skeptical. Perhaps you can help Tubbins and Gubbins show her that, through tea, all things are possible!"
8075,"Elysian Hold : One more step yet remains before your initiation is complete.  You must now enter Elysian Hold, entryway to the rest of the Spires of Ascension and the vantage point from which the ascended safeguard Bastion and our aspirants in training.  Once there, we shall ensure you are fully acquainted with the hold's offerings. Since you lack wings, I shall escort you there."
8076,"Shadowlands: A Chilling Summons : The time has come, <class>.  Highlord Bolvar Fordragon requests your presence atop Icecrown Citadel. Meet me in Orgrimmar, and I will take you to him.  I would not keep him waiting."
8077,"Harvester of Desire : So, here's the sketch: we muck you up to look like one of the servants. This stuff is protected by anti-theft so if 'em clothes think they are being stolen they teleport back here, you an' all.  You ""should"" be able to reach the Countess with your message. Just smile, nod, do as you're told, don't talk to anyone, and don't make eye contact with anything that's got wings. They'll know you shouldn't be there."
8078,"A Show of Gratitude : Your presence here fulfils an ancient prophecy, Maw Walker. I am certain you and your allies will save us.  Perhaps I judged your broker friend too harshly. She did escort you to Korthia, after all.   Please extend our thanks to Ve'nari, and let her know we are happy to answer her questions.  She... does seem to have quite a number of them."
8079,"Ani-Matter Animator : This area is rich with the remains of fallen soldiers... some of which still carry a spark of potential.  I've created what I call the ""Ani-Matter Orb,"" with which you can reanimate the skeletal matter littered throughout the foundry.   Let us see how many of the new animates would join our cause.  As for those who don't... well, they should be quite accustomed to being slain by now."
8080,"RSVP: Plague Deviser Marileth : Oh! This sounds like a wonderful opportunity to do field research in Revendreth, apprentice.  I look forward to collaborating with new colleagues. We must bring a gift to thank them for their invitation. What could be more appropriate than some lovely slimes?  Please pick some of the best slimes for me to present to our host. Just bring them to Kevin so they can make friends and travel together."
8081,The Meaning of Wrath : I will gather my forces and dispense a portion to Korthia immediately. I will also see to it that they are provided the tools Baroness Vashj and Kael'thas were able to conjure so that we might further defend against nathrezim incursions.  Other duties require my attention before I can descend on Korthia. I must secure Dominance Keep against further infiltrators.  I suppose the Primus will want an update. You may tell him you were successful.
8082,"Overhead Intelligence : The Countess knows the fates and goings-on of every noble in Revendreth. It is the best way to keep them in her debt.  However, she has a dark secret. Despite what she may say... she was once mortal.  We will need to find where she keeps her sinstone. No easy feat, of course.  We will need to gather some intel. The venthyr of the Chalice District are constantly gossiping. Collect their letters from the couriers until you learn something of interest."
8083,"The Master of Lies : Once more unto the fangs of death himself, sword drawn, peace with oblivion made. Let us meet death together and bring him low.  Be sure you are prepared for a sustained assault. For once we reveal ourselves, there will be no stopping.   When you are ready, direct the Focal Mirror at the gates of Castle Nathria. Let us descend upon our burning enemies with ferocity and swiftness of action."
8084,Harvester of Envy : Thank you for meeting us at a minimum safe distance from the Caretaker's Manor. There are enough people around here that may still find the idea of me in a cage to be worth the trouble.  It is too dangerous for you or I to speak to the Tithelord. He is too impulsive and eager to please Denathrius. I recommend we send Temel.   The stone fiend is a common messenger for Revendreth and few aside from a handful of observers will bat an eye at his arrival. Just shove him when you are ready.
8085,"Applied Science : <What appears to be an old journal sits on Marileth's table, now mangled and missing pages.  The entries that are legible seem to have been written by Marileth when he was still sane, before the fall of his house.  Perhaps if you find the journal's missing pages, you will gain more insight into what befell the House of Plagues.>"
8086,"Anger Management : I am no musician, though I've spent many an hour enjoying the entertainment in Tazavesh.  Giving this horn a voice will require the harvest of strong emotions.  Anger seethes unrestrained within the damned unfortunates consigned to the River of Souls. Use this siphoning device to drain the rage of these furious shades into your instrument.  The shrieks of fury that you acquire should allow you to pierce the Maw and reach your allies.  The tune, I suspect, will not be a popular one."
8087,"Phalynx Malfunction : As part of their training, I order my phalynx units to march the fields, keeping an eye on the wildlife and any goings-on.  Unfortunately, last time they returned they were one fewer in number.  Please search the Golden Pasture and search for the missing unit, then return it here."
8088,
8089,"Doorway in the Dark : I fear our efforts to stop Zovaal have been thwarted, mortal.  A doorway has been opened to a forbidden realm... and the Banished One has reclaimed a power taken from him long ago.  I sense your allies returning from the Sanctum of Domination. I must know every detail of what transpired."
8090,"Read Between the Lines : Ah, mortal, how fortunate that I, humble Ta'eran, happen to be standing here just as you, the outsider everyone is talking about, happens to wander by!  In the spirit of cooperation and mutual interests, there is a matter I wish to discuss.  A nearby structure called the Sepulcher of Knowledge was built as a repository for military strategy. I fear the knowledge contained within may soon be lost.  If you would do me the honor of escorting me to the Sepulcher, I can share what else I know."
8091,"RSVP: The Countess : The Prince wishes to host court? Well, that should be interesting...  I am sure you understand that one musn't give without receiving something of value in return. It sets a terrible precedent, provides unrealistic expectations, and encourages beggars.   So you shall do something for me.  House Briarbane is very proud of their new mascot. They have been flaunting it in the streets and irritating the other houses.  Steal it for me, but incriminate one of the other houses in the act."
8092,"Rule 5: Be Audacious : You have proven yourself a useful associate, <class>. In thanks, I have crafted a cypher that will allow you to venture further into the Maw.  But... it is experimental in nature. You will have to test it in the field. And I have just the test in mind.  Cartel Ve has foolishly sent more agents into the Maw. They were captured and taken to Perdition Hold. I must know why.  Breach the fortress and learn what has become of the captive brokers. Nothing is more valuable than knowledge of your enemy's plans."
8093,"The Slaughter Daughter : When I was locked up, I made a list of all the constructs that betrayed me... it is a lengthy list!  Help me teach these constructs the mistake they made. I want to destroy everyone on my list, along with Yardmaster Pralak, who is number one on the list!"
8094,"Front and Center : The runes on that blade... they are the same as the ones etched on the door to the Seat of the Primus.   And one of them just began to glow...  Is this what I think it is, $p? Do you have the means to unseal the Seat?   If so, then perhaps Vyraz's gambit was not for nothing. This could turn the tide of the entire war!"
8095,"Rule 7: Betrayal is Inevitable : Our arrangement has been quite lucrative. Reliable associates like yourself can be so hard to find.  I believe I can entrust you with a task I would usually perform on my own.  While working with the tracking runes you retrieved for me earlier, I detected a device of broker origin nearby. It must have been brought into the Maw by the captured expedition.  Please examine it and prepare it for transport back to the refuge. I will join you shortly.  This could be a valuable discovery."
8096,"Who Are You Fooling? : We cannot conduct the ritual without a very special guest. He's a silkstrider larva named Grubby and he's my best friend.  Unfortunately, the nasty spriggans took him! What's worse is they cast illusions on what they steal, so no one can take it back!  The spriggans often carry trickster powder. If you can take some of that stuff, I can reverse their illusions and rescue Grubby."
8097,"When a Gorm Eats a God : There is nothing more we can do here. I will get Master Sha'lor safely back to Tirna Vaal.  When you get there, report to the droman what we found here.   If the gorm have started to eat the dead wildseeds, and are absorbing the power of the spirits within, we are all in serious danger."
8098,
8099,"The Boon of Shapes : <Moonberry looks serious.>  Mortal though you are, you have chosen to become one of our champions. While you uphold our cause, we are obligated to extend hospitality to you within our sacred hall and grant you certain boons.  As a member of the Court of Night, I can bestow our powers on chosen mortals.  <name>, <class> of Azeroth,  I bid you welcome to the first tree, Tirna Achiad, the Heart of the Forest.  Please, follow me."
8100,"Korthia, the City of Secrets : We are on the threshold of attaining our desires, Maw Walker.  Your grand waystone cannot be far off. Of course, my needs are much more modest. A bit of useful information here, a priceless relic there...  I will survey the area to see if there is anything useful--or hazardous--nearby. Then we can proceed."
8101,"Carving Out a Path : While I abhor violence and prefer a reasoned response to conflict, there is no alternative here.  In order for Roh-Suir and I to escape safely, you must deliver a decisive strike to the Mawsworn who have invaded Seeker's Quorum.  Carve out a path so that we may escape."
8102,"Digging Around : The thin pale ones of Revendreth have been hoarding anima.   I've heard they've been hiding it away, digging holes in the woods and just leaving it there. Anyone could come along and take it.  I say that should be us!  Let's go get some anima."
8103,"The Hunt for the Baron : <The amulet Bolvar gave you flickers with a faint red light, then grows dim.  To be useful in finding Darion Mograine, you must find a way to restore its potency.  You recall an area called Zovaal's Cauldron that was teeming with dark magic.  Perhaps the amulet's power could be restored there.>"
8104,"Dreadlords! : This is the fifth dreadlord I have found infiltrating our forces this week. Unchecked they can cause tremendous damage to our foothold here.  In life I learned how to identify these creatures from a demon hunter. It makes it far easier for me to locate them, but I cannot be in all places at once.  We must report these findings to the Primus."
8105,"Our Forgotten Purpose : I have no quarrel with you, Maw Walker.  The Lord Chamberlain and his abhorrent followers have debased these halls with their perversions of the rituals. Abusing souls and destroying their potential for pathetic mockeries of power.  The Accuser would never have allowed this. I have heard rumors that you may still be in contact with her. If so, please inform her of the situation here.  She will bring these depraved dogs to heel."
8106,"Mark of Humility : Quartermaster, you've arrived.  Those fools over there still haven't gotten past the first barrier. We need to get into that cave to have any chance at recovering the Spear of Kalliope.  Our research discovered the phrase, ""Only the humble find their way. Even heroes kneel before virtue."" But those fools have been working on that clue for ages.  Go figure out the problem and get inside that cave. We need its mark to open the final vault."
8107,"Into the Coliseum : The time of your challenge has come!  As you are not a being of Bastion, you shall act as a tactician for your soulbinds. You have developed mighty bonds between each other... let us see how they handle the coliseum.  Let me know when you are ready to begin. Show us the merit of your bonds!"
8108,"Out On the Edge : It sounds like Huln was taken elsewhere, and by the Stonewright herself!  We should look for signs she came through the area. Hopefully that will lead us to Huln!"
8109,"Insider Trading : I am the foremost expert on broker culture. However, relationships between cartels are complicated and unstable.  Cartel So holds a small presence here in Oribos, which means the other cartels may have knowledge that I do not. Ask around; with your renown, surely they'll have whatever information that we are missing."
8110,"A Traitor's Due : Vyraz has been a constant thorn in Maldraxxus's side since he betrayed us. As Baroness of the House of the Chosen, it is my duty to see this threat eliminated... and the murder of Margrave Krexus avenged.  As the Primus said, we must remove the head from this snake.  The time to strike is now!"
8111,"The Absolution of Souls : Do you not yet understand the purpose of Revendreth, Maw Walker?  The souls under our care teeter on the brink of permanent damnation. Even with perfect attention and careful processing, not every soul can escape the Maw and be elevated to a higher destiny.  That is true under the best of circumstances.  Currently, due to your installation of the Chamberlain at the Halls of Atonement, we're instead witnessing the worst of circumstances.  We must return to the Halls of Atonement and enforce order."
8112,"Intact Aquilon Core : <The massive devourer was clutching this aquilon power core in its fist when it died, no doubt ripped from one of the destroyed aquilon around it. The power core appears to be almost entirely intact.  Deos in Keeper's Respite would be able to help you locate an aquilon that you could power with it.>"
8113,"You and What Army : The Jailer has dispatched a force of elite troops to strike our rear lines. Their attack threatens our whole assault!    I need you and one other soldier to eliminate these enemies. A volunteer from each of the five houses of Maldraxxus has requested to assist you, <name>.  Pick one and give them the honor of serving alongside you."
8114,"Establishing the Archive : I will head to Keeper's Respite, where there is some small semblance of safety.  There, we will establish a new archive.  Meet me there when you are able.  I hope we can count on you again. We will have need of your assistance there in the future."
8115,"One Little Whisper : Here be da deal, <name>. To get  Mueh'zala talkin', we gotta feed him a teeny bit a da life essence of everybody in dis room.  Why ya be lookin' at me like dat? When has ol' Bwonsamdi ever let ya down?  Me gonna use da mojo ya got to pull da truth outta him while he be feedin'.  Oh, uh, just two more tings. First, I need ya to be ringin' an invitation to a special... friend.  Den I be giving ya more of me mojo powder. Use it during da ritual if any o' me followers be gettin' too weak."
8116,"The Speaker of Elune : Fortune smiles upon us, <name>. We have found a soul in Ardenweald who was once a Night Warrior in life, as Tyrande is now.   His name is Thiernax. I am told he assists in tending to the spirits resting in the Garden of Night.  Seek him out and petition him for aid. I pray he will have wisdom to share."
8117,"Bring Your Own : Scunner, a roiling mass of flesh and slime, has crawled out of the ruins of the House of Plagues.   He emits a toxic vapor that impairs the functions of those who attempt to fight him. You can try it, Maw Walker, but it's doubtful you could hurt him on your own.  Constructs are built to fight creatures like Scunner. So gather a force of them and eliminate the threat."
8118,"Observational Records : Greetings, Maw Walker, a moment of your time?  As you no doubt know, my cartel has quietly spread observational devices all across Korthia. But that data is no good to us if it is not retrieved. Which is where you come in.  The records from the Windswept Aerie and Estuary of Awakening should be ready to collect. You won't see the devices themselves, but the data will appear to you as a bright orb.  And don't forget to look below ground!  Bring those data to me, and I will reward you handsomely."
8119,"Our Realm Reclaimed : Though Forsworn still fight across Bastion, the Temple of Loyalty is ours, and with it our realm.  We will have to stay diligent to maintain control of all of the temples, and much remains to be decided with the fate of our fallen brethren, but today is a day of great victory.  Join me at the Crest of Ascension, and witness its final empowerment."
8120,"The Blade in the Night : Though my hunt has been arduous, I have two promising leads on additional Night Warriors. The first is here in Maldraxxus.  This tower contains records of those who arrived in Maldraxxus, including someone referred to as ""The Blade in the Night."" I believe this to be our next Night Warrior.  I encountered many traps on the way here. Doubtless we will find more within the tower. Someone is trying to stop us.  We will not let them succeed."
8121,"The House of the Chosen : <Draka gestures to the sky.>  Look there, mortal. That is the necropolis of Margrave Krexus, who leads the House of the Chosen. It is my honor to serve as his baroness.  Let us ride to our fortress. There we can gather our strength and make ready for the battle to come."
8122,"Return Those Animacones! : Reports say that once again the spriggan are proving to be a nuisance, <name>.  Word is that a bunch of them broke into the stores at the Heart of the Forest and made off with a huge store of animacones.  Needless to say, we need those animacones back.  The report says the spriggan group split up as they were making their escape, so any one you see is as likely to be carrying the animacones as the next.   Good luck."
8123,Talisman of the Eternal Scholar : <The talisman is dented and spattered with muck. Whoever stashed this here handled it roughly.  Archivist Roh-Suir has a spot for this talisman in the Reliquary of Remembrance.>
8124,"Training in Maldraxxus : Our aspiring warriors must be trained in the thick of battle, in the harshest conditions, for wars do not happen lightly, and never will it give them pause for breath.  Take this one to Maldraxxus--the heart of the armies of the Shadowlands resides there. It is a land in chaos and turmoil, filled with fallen champions and gladiators.  There, they will face true challenges, and return with great knowledge."
8125,
8126,"Singing Steel Ingot : <The ingot wails, in a warbling vibrato.>  Woe! These ruffians hammer upon me with nary a care, bending my body to suit their ill aims.  Fie! Fie upon them.  <The ingot emits a high-pitched battle cry.>  Take the hammering to these mawsworn!"
8127,"A Fate Most Noble : Welcome, Worthy One!  I am Greeter Mnemis. It is my duty and pleasure to assist you on this, your first day among the kyrian.  Allow me to congratulate you. Your fate is reserved for the most noble of souls. Only those who lived a life of service may call Bastion home.  I am certain you have many questions- all new aspirants do! Please allow me the honor of introducing you to the next chapter of your existence.  We will begin when you are ready."
8128,Supplies from The Archivists' Codex : I have no words to express the warmth that fills me knowing your dedication has ensured Korthia's history remain intact.  Please. Allow me to share my gratitude.
8129,"Rightful Resting Place : You have truly proven yourself a hero in the eyes of those who are its absolute judge.  I thank you for giving me the honor of holding it, even for this briefest moment. However, it is only proper that you be the one to enshrine the spear at it's rightful resting place.  Let us meet at Elysian Hold where you can do the honors."
8130,"A Complete Set : This is only volume one?  We can't just take the first volume. A rare item like this is only useful if it's in a complete set!  Grab as many of the other volumes as you can, I will have to prepare a larger expedition to remove all of these volumes."
8131,Construct Part: Necromantic Oil : <This could be used to construct a powerful abomination. Perhaps Rathan will know how we can use it.>
8132,"Nal'ragas : The Stonewright's medallion must not stay in the hands of the nathrezim.   From what the Accuser explained of our mission, the medallion is required if we wish to forge a new sigil for the Venthyr. I have no doubt that is why Nal'ragas and her ilk executed their ambush now.  The medallions are not subtle magic, and their affect on this realm is easily tracked. I suggest we give chase and eliminate this Nal'ragas before she can be reinforced."
8133,"Craftsman Needs No Tools : Oh, I am quite all right! There's just one little thing....One of these fiends made off with my lucky mallet! I simply cannot leave my mallet behind. I do not even use it much any more, but it is quite lucky and I always keep it with me.Please, I cannot even think about building anything without it. Do keep an eye out for it, will you?"
8134,"Lysonia's Truth : If I had not seen it with my own eyes, I do not know that I would believe such a thing is possible.  You carry a significant piece of Lysonia within you, now. Go to the Soul Mirrors and open yourself to them. With luck, they will draw from her essence to draw forth a memory of the Forsworn.  If this works, we may know what they are planning within minutes!"
8135,"That's Going to Sting : <Niya speaks loudly to be heard over the buzzing coming from the collection of needler nests behind her.>  I've caught Moonberry trying to steal these nests for her pranks over ten times already!  The other faeries said I was crazy to bring the needlers out here. Too wild! Too unpredictable!  But that's exactly why we need them.  Lord Herne's scouts report powerful Heralds among our enemy's forces.  Take one of these nests, and use it to surprise the Heralds!"
8136,"Secrets Among the Shelves : Now that the door to the Sepulcher is unlocked, we can venture inside.  And by ""we"", I mean ""you"". Until it's safe, at least.  The volumes within contain the collected wisdom of the greatest military minds of Maldraxxus. For the good of the Necrolords, do whatever is needed to gather these precious volumes.  It is safe to assume that the books will be protected by traps. The Primus wouldn't want just anyone laying their hands on this knowledge.  Once you clear a path, I'll join you."
8137,"Staff of the Primus : The Staff of the Primus. The final piece of our leader's regalia.  I can't deny the pride I feel in restoring this hall. You should feel the same sense of accomplishment.  The statue awaits you, <name>. Bring glory to this realm."
8138,"Step Into the Light : It is as I feared.  This fragment of Uther's soul was darkened by the mourneblade that slew him. His memories are shattered and twisted.  For Uther to move past his pain, to move past his grief, he must experience his past once again.  But he does not have to do this alone.  Using my soul mirror, we can aid Uther in walking through these memories. He can then come to terms with the emotions they contain. We must help him see past the distortions and understand the truths they hold."
8139,"Our True Purpose : We are grateful for this partnership, Maw Walker.   With your help, Renathal will lead us into a new era, one that will see Revendreth reclaim its true purpose.   Return to him now so that the real work can begin."
8140,"Home of the Tirnenn : The Horned Hunter is no longer here. But I do know where he went.  He tracked his prey to the west of here, in the Elder Stand. These woods in particular have grown dangerous as of late, and we are currently beset by invading devourers.  They have overrun the roads between here and the Stand. I shall accompany you across the bridge, and see that you are delivered to the Horned Hunter."
8141,
8142,"One Big Problem : We must go after Master Sha'lor. Tirna Vaal needs him! And I... I...  I will report to the droman. They must know that Sha'lor is in danger. Then, I will enter the burrows myself from the south and help you defeat it.  For now, see what you can find. I refuse to believe that he is gone.  That monster will know the fury of a vorkai."
8143,"Akarek Avenged : The last of those traitors involved in taking down Margrave Akarek are dead.   It will not bring our Margrave back, but I am still pleased.  My Baroness wished for us to inform Margrave Sin'dane that the job was done before departing for Ardenweald."
8144,
8145,"The Recovery of Tyrande Whisperwind : The Night Warrior's power is tearing Tyrande apart. Such rage... it is consuming her.  <Shandris is silent a moment.>  And yet, my mother speaks true. We cannot leave the souls of my people to suffer.  We shall follow Tyrande into Torghast. We must find a way to save the spirits of the kaldorei.  And in the process, pray that we can save my minn'do as well."
8146,"On Lysonia's Trail : Our scouts have reported spotting Lysonia and Uther en route to the Temple of Humility.  As the de facto leader of the Forsworn, we must not allow her to stand free, twisting the minds of those around her.  The disciples of Humility have not answered our beckons. I have sent Kleia ahead to reconnoiter. Meet her outside the temple."
8147,
8148,"A Symbol of Hope : Before Anduin followed the Jailer through the gateway, he dropped something.  I don't think this was part of the Jailer's plan. It must be a sign that Anduin's soul is still his own!  <Jaina opens her hand to show you a golden compass.>  This was very personal to Anduin. I feel his presence upon it.  We need to know why he left it for us."
8149,"Mysterious Gifts from Ve'nari : I'm impressed by your sheer tenacity to survive while remaining somewhat useful, Maw Walker. You remind me of myself when I was much younger and naive.   Take this and continue your work... somewhere less conspicuous."
8150,
8151,"Stewards of a Feather : You! Maw Walker!  The forge was bustling. Many forgehands, on task!  Then Forsworn came. Some followed their demands, turned to their side.  But not all! Yes, rescue forgehands so they can aid us. Work to be done!"
8152,"Support the Court : Groves are under attack everywhere! There simply aren't enough of us to protect them all!  You just might be our only hope.  We must restore order, or more precious souls will be lost to us. Please, help anyone you can, anywhere you can. My heart cannot bear to see any more pain!  I'll make sure the Winter Queen hears of your deeds, don't you worry!"
8153,"Fathomless Power : Forgive me, apprentice... I felt a bit woozy for a moment! But you've done it! You've crafted the potion!  I'm so proud of you. What joy your work brought to our margrave!  What manner of teacher would I be were I to ask for your help and not offer my own in return? If you have research you must conduct, you have my full support!  Let us venture to your laboratory, then. I wait with bated breath to behold your future achievements!"
8154,"Every Dog Has Its Day : Maw Walker, when I heard you were building constructs and a home for souls still loyal to Maldraxxus, I began my search for you!  I am loyal and have always wanted a construct form, but the Margrave was unwilling to build one that suited my natural inclinations.    I lived my whole life with the curse, it's all I know, and it's all I still want.  Would you build a construct for me?"
8155,"A Curious Invitation : Psst. You there. Yeah, you.  You that Maw Walker them fangs been going on about? Huh. I figured you'd be bigger.  Anyway, the Taskmaster wants to ahhh ... ""extend his compliments and an invitation to visit his workings."" That's a fancy word for a bunch of rocks me and my mates are diggin' up.  If you're keen an' all that, pop down to Feeder's Thicket and meet with the fang's courier, Araak. He'll get you sorted right out."
8156,"The Dawnkeep Prisoner : Oh, you have not heard the news yet.  We have him. Sire Denathrius, Master of Revendreth, imprisoned within his own blade.  We managed to best him during one of our recent raids of Castle Nathria.  It took an army of unparalleled valor and preparation. It took skill and wealth. It took a miracle.  And so the redeemer shall be redeemed. Would you like to know more?"
8157,A Fine Vintage : We will need something special to use as the base of our mixture. To get him to drink it down he will have to believe you've brought him a gift.   He fancies himself quite the connoisseur. Some ancient and stuffy vintage will tempt him.  Check the old cellar near the ruins. It once held supplies. Perhaps a bottle still lingers in the depths. Araak and I will work out the other details.
8158,"The Hunt's Gratitude : The forests of Ardenweald are safer with your help, envoy of the kyrian.  As a reward for your aid, we shall allow you to capture our memory. It is an honor to be chosen to help train the mighty warriors of Bastion.  Whenever you are ready."
8159,"Sure Bet : You appear to have great profit potential.  There are many interested parties willing to bet upon your performance in the Theater of Pain.  Go now, Louison will arrange your appearance."
8160,"A Travel Journal : <This book appears to be a travelogue of this book's personal journey around Ardenweald! And self-written and published no less!  Flipping towards the end you see yourself enter the picture as a villain, unjustly attacking the book and opening it.   You read ""This book appears to be a travelogue of this book's personal journey around Ardenweald! And Self-written and-""  You hurriedly close the book, feeling queasy. It should go back to Archivist Dreyden.>"
8161,"Ember Court: Entertainment : Everyone loves entertainment!  Our first guest is from the Halls of Atonement, so he will certainly appreciate a presentation of the powerful rituals the Accuser is capable of.  Work with Hips to acquire everything we need to host atoning rituals at the Ember Court."
8162,
8163,"A Wandering Tale : <This book might have a point, but the author is taking every possible detour along the way. Or maybe it's about the journey and not the destination...  In any case, Archivist Dreyden would probably be pleased to have his book back.>"
8164,"Reason for the Treason : If you ask me, the attack on our convoy is suspicious. I told Mistress Mihaela that there must be a traitor in the village, but she isn't concerned. It's understandable. She's got to worry about gathering a new tithe.  I've taken it upon myself to figure this out and I could use your help. I'm making discreet inquiries but I can't be seen speaking with the help. That's where you come in. You can be my assistant sleuth."
8165,"A Gathering of Covenants : Though the Jailer remains confined to the Maw, his cruelty extends beyond the bounds of his prison.  Thankfully, the Archon is recovering from the attack. Though I am told her wound has an... unsettling quality.  The Eternal Ones and their allies await you and Highlord Fordragon in the Arbiter's chamber. I shall open the way.  With her voice have I spoken."
8166,
8167,"Break Out : Our reinforcements never came, leaving us unable to tend to the souls here. They have begun to break out of their cells. Many of them are not ready for the next step in the process.  Take these iron chains. They can be used to rein them under your control.   Once you have a soul bound, you can return them to any intact cage you can find."
8168,"Seeking Smugglers : We brokers have found that it is in our best interests to remain mobile. And discreet.  A number of our cities and outposts are tucked away in the In-Between, capable of moving from place to place.  Much to my chagrin, it seems I have lost track of Tazavesh.  I believe our best course of action is to ask Cartel Ta for access. They pride themselves on keeping track of such things.  Let's try our luck with those at the Night Market in Revendreth. They may be more forthcoming than their Oribos kin."
8169,"Among the Kyrian : You will be well at home among the kyrian, <brother/sister>. We welcome your aid.  The Archon was so confident in this outcome that she has arranged a grand reception for you in honor of your efforts against the Maldraxxus incursion into our realm.  For now, all you must do is journey to the Seat of Eternal Hymns. I shall meet you there."
8170,"To Darkhaven : Across this bridge is the hamlet of Darkhaven. It is fortified by those loyal to Sire Denathrius. These pitiful rebels would not dare approach it.  However, getting to it may prove challenging. Here, I shall carry the anima, you make sure no one throws us back into the Endmire."
8171,"Take the Bull by the Horns : I've carved out quite the reputation as a tauralus wrangler. Everyone needs a tauralus!  You do some work for me, and people will know who you are as well.  Take this bone splinter and poke a few juicy nibblers. Use them to lure a tauralus to you, then ride it back to me."
8172,"Trust Fall : Let us ponder the meaning of the Archivist's last words: ""Victory only belongs to those brave enough to fall.""  Hmm. It could be reference to the Volume of Victory. That is the most well-known of all the writings said to be kept in this tower.  That book is priceless, <name>. I mean that almost literally. We must do whatever is necessary to find it!  But, uh... What do you suppose ""brave enough to fall"" refers to?"
8173,
8174,"Mysteries of the Maw : The Maw is changing, mortal. And with change comes opportunity.  The Jailer has pulled a realm that was hidden deep within the Shadowlands into the Maw. It is a location of some interest to me, but I do not wish to approach it alone.  The Mawsworn are swarming the area, you see. There must be something of value that they seek.  I have a safe enclave nearby. Accompany me there and I may be able to help you find that waystone you're looking for.  Do we have a deal?"
8175,"The Final Relics : I have excellent news, <name>. I have uncovered the last set of our missing relics!   It may be difficult for you to locate them, but I have developed the proper research to aid you.  Please, review the last of our missing relics. We are so close to finding them all!"
8176,"Rule 4: Make A List : I've discovered that one of the Jailer's inquisitors is attempting to devise a method to track my movements.  Clearly, that is a problem for me... and by extension, it is a problem for you.  The inquisitor has risen to the top of my list of potential threats. In the past, I would have had to deal with him myself. But now... I have a business partner.  Put an end to him, yes? And if you can, determine exactly how he intended to track me."
8177,"Tower Knowledge : The woven power of this box can only be unlocked by feeding it pride and memory. In its weave are incantations I have seen used in the other realms to siphon or condition a soul. This... abomination... has used these tools of redemption and honor to create a lock.  As you challenge the floors of Torghast, your skill, speed, and efficiency will all contribute to Tower Knowledge which this box can feed upon.   Feed it to retrieve the powers within."
8178,"Wilderling Saddle : <As you slipped off of the escaped wilderling's back, it shook its saddle off at your feet. It reluctantly left your side as the night fae led it back to Keeper's Respite.  Reldorn in Keeper's Respite might know what to make of this gesture.>"
8179,"Stabbing Wasteward : I've been finding a lot of tauralus corpses lately, and I know it's all because those bonetooths Caleesy loves so much!  I spotted the one that's responsible for the slaughter just west of here. Get rid of it!   And don't mention this to Caleesy!"
8180,"Bolstering Bastion : You are no aspirant, but I welcome any aid that Oribos might bring us in these dire times.  Please, aid our people in any way you can. With anima in low supply and the insidious Forsworn encroaching from all sides, there is no shortage of trials to overcome.  Do this for us, and I will see to it myself that our almighty Archon hears of your deeds in service of the kyrian. Mark well my words, and follow the path."
8181,"Echoes of Fate : The devourers have swarmed this place, but our focus must remain on finding the Fatescribe.  Attendants who worshipped here would leave offerings of anima at the shrines.  The implement you found will resonate if the Fatescribe has been nearby. With any luck, it will give us insight into where he has gone."
8182,"You Go First : You've proven useful. So, I am going to require you to disarm the defenses of this hall.   Please take care not to die too quickly. I'd like to have the spear before the end of this eon."
8183,"Report to the Queen : Mueh'zala's forces are routed, and it's only a matter of time before the Wild Hunt completely purges them from Ardenweald.  But something tells me that the struggle between Bwonsamdi and Mueh'zala is far from over. That creepy little mask has gone silent...  You should hurry back to the Heart of the Forest and report to the Winter Queen. She will decide what we do next."
8184,They Could Be Anyone : <The still-warm head of the dreadlord Azodius grimaces at you.  The attendants at Keeper's Respite should be told of the Fatescribe's abduction.  No doubt Highlord Fordragon will want to hear of this unexpected threat.>
8185,Drum of the Death Loa : <Your familiarity with the Archivists' Codex makes it clear that this is one of the missing relics.  Archivist Roh-Suir has a spot for this drum in the Reliquary of Remembrance.>
8186,"The Vessels of Leather and Bone : You have the bearing of one familiar with the art of leatherworking. But perhaps you have more to learn.  Vessels that hold the power of the runes can be crafted by a hand such as yours. But this I cannot teach you.  Hmm, there is a way. I will entrust you with a memory of my recipes for the vessels. Take it to a master of your craft and they will show you the way.  What's that? Do not worry. It is merely an echo of my memory. What you restored to me remains intact."
8187,"Cryptograms : If the nathrezim have infiltrated Sinfall they will be communicating, and not just through hand gestures or spoken words. They like to use magical written messages concealed by a simple cantrip, invisible to the average observer.  However, I have developed an incantation that should allow you to see these messages.  Find these cryptograms and bring me their contents. I can translate them if they are beyond your understanding."
8188,"For Queen and Grove! : A stunning performance... in more ways than one.  So much has transpired on Azeroth in my absence. But there was one dream I did not see portrayed onstage.  I dreamt of Tyrande, engulfed in darkness, twisted by anger and a thirst for vengeance. I witnessed a forbidden ritual, the rise of a new Night Warrior, and a hunt that can end only in tragedy. That too must be real.  <Ysera shakes her head.>  The Winter Queen awaits you in the Heart of the Forest. We had best be on our way."
8189,"Necrotic Wake: A Paragon's Plight : Xandria, the mighty Paragon of Courage, is the finest warrior among all the ascended. But even she may be overwhelmed by the strongest of Maldraxxus' forces.  Your fate is intertwined with hers, now. You must gather your allies and plunge into the Necrotic Wake to ensure both Amarth and Nalthor do not make it back to the safety of their realm.  May the Archon guide your blade into their hearts."
8190,Atonement Crypt Key : <This key is marked with a sigil that matches the crypts in the Halls of Atonement. What is the Lord Chamberlain hiding away in there?>
8191,"Beneath the Mask : It's time to end this.When I first hid, I saw a dark shape on the northeast platform. I think that's their leader.Now that they can't perform any more rituals, we should be able to scare them off.<Primrose pauses for a moment.>I... I just wanted to say thank you. I never could have done this without your help. Now, let's drive out this enemy and retake the village!"
8192,"A Shadowed Fate : The Mawsworn... torture and torment souls within Ruin's Cradle.  I... barely escaped, but I'm afraid I won't last long.  Their twisted rituals... breaking souls to serve as wretched shades.   Spare them this fate!"
8193,"May I Take Your Order? : Chordy is just the first success, there will be many more!  As free souls show up here, speak with them and take their requests for new construct bodies. We'll soon have lots of new constructs to work on!"
8194,"The Vessels of the Thread : You have the bearing of one familiar with the art of thread work. But perhaps you have more to learn.  Vessels that hold the power of the runes can be crafted by a hand such as yours. But this I cannot teach you.  Hmm, there is a way. I will entrust you with a memory of my recipes for the vessels. Take it to a master of your craft and they will show you the way.  What's that? Do not worry. It is merely an echo of my memory. What you restored to me remains intact."
8195,"Coins for the Ferryman : Your side of the deal is done, Maw Walker. Now for your payment.  My cartel runs a ferry that travels between Oribos and Tazavesh. Its purpose is to transport cargo, but as in all things, there are... exceptions.  Take this coin to Ta'meri and you will be provided safe passage to the market.  What happens after that is up to you.  <Ta'oku bows, uttering a sound that seems almost like a chuckle.>"
8196,"The End of the Beginning : <Renathal struggles to speak, his wounds evident.>  I knew Denathrius had hoarded anima, but this... this is beyond imagining.  The Jailer will surely use this power to shatter his bonds. Should he break free of the Maw, all the realms of Death will fall.  We must continue to press the fight against Denathrius. Alas, we cannot hope to succeed alone.   Return to Oribos with Draven and speak to the Honored Voice, Tal-Inara. Tell her what you have seen this day and implore her to action."
8197,"Getting Backstage : The next thing we need to prepare the vessel is a set of Night's Veil Flowers.  We use these flowers in our ceremonies, but since the drought we've just used them as props in our plays. There are certainly some backstage at the Star Lake Amphitheater.  I bet Moonberry is there for the rehearsal of their next play. As a bonus, this will work out quite nicely for me to get revenge on her.  <Willowblossom flashes a wicked grin.>"
8198,Seeking the Baron : Take this amulet. One like it is carried by each of the Four Horsemen.  The amulets are imbued with a power that links them to one another. That connection should help you locate Darion Mograine.  No doubt Darion has witnessed countless horrors in the Maw. Perhaps he has caught sight of the missing baron.  Let us hope he can lead you to our Azerothian allies as well.
8199,"Visions of the Dreamer: Origins : The spirit within the wildseed dreams of her birth and youth, in the primordial days of her world.  Go to the first Dreamshrine outside of Hibernal Hollow. Meditate at the shrine, and soothe this vision of how her life began."
8200,"RSVP: Cryptkeeper Kassir : I would be most honored to attend Prince Renathal's Ember Court.  I prefer to wear my official signet ring for such prestigious occasions. It was given to me by the Accuser herself when I was first charged with my duties.  However, the Lord Chamberlain's goons have stolen it once more.  They hide their ill-gotten gains inside of these crypts... But I have no idea which one houses my ring.  It may take some time to find Atonement Crypt Keys, but any venthyr here in the halls could have one."
8201,Hearing Aid : How fortuitous! You just happened to be transferred to a location in which I have a certain... interest. Place the aural sequencers I gave you and I will attempt to establish a functional signal.  Such a perilous location will require the utmost discretion. You will want to use your ethereal cloak to avoid being seen.
8202,"A Naughty Story : <You have held this book for less than five minutes and it has already escaped once, bitten you twice and somehow managed to steal some gold.  This is not what you were expecting from a ""Naughty Story"" but then again, maybe you should have.  You bind the book closed so it will hopefully cause a minimum of mischief. Time to bring it to Archivist Dreyden.>"
8203,"Dread Priming : Sire Denathrius has requested I help you prepare for the hunt. Every hunter must help prepare a soul here in the Grove of Terror.  I have a stubborn soul here who's been quite uncooperative, Houndmaster Loksey. His time has come to be hunted.  <The Fearstalker hands you a set of Hopebreaker Soul Chains.>  Demoralize him. We can't let him leave here with any hope. The hunt is meant to break the souls so they become less... resistant to the processes of Revendreth."
8204,"Corpse Run : There's work that needs doing 'round here. Mmmm hmmm.  Spotted a big ol' carcass nearby. I aim to salvage it for parts.   Figure you could come along, help me drag it to Rathan. He'd like that. Mmmm hmmm.   Reckon I could even carry you there and back. You don't look too big.  Ready to get going?"
8205,"Path of Ascension: Kleia : Artemede has been personally training Kleia, running her through combat meditations and drills.  She has come far, and she is prepared to take on another trial in the Path of Ascension.  Return to the coliseum and guide her as her tactician so that she may reach victory."
8206,
8207,"Through the Shattered Sky : When Sylvanas shattered the Helm of Domination, she was touched by the power it released.  I can sense the echoes of that power, and I know where she has gone.  If you wish to rescue your leaders, the shattered helm can open a path. It cannot bring you back, however. That you must do on your own.  The risk is great, <name>, but there is no other way. We will begin the ritual at once."
8208,"What Must Be Found : There is much detailed in the codex. Items that are forever lost, and some that still exist.  Some powerful relics may remain, hidden somewhere within Korthia.   Browse the reliquary. You will find echoes of artifacts that are still whole here in Korthia.  Commit them to memory. You must find them and return them to me."
8209,"The Power of Elune : We have done as much as we can with the time we had.  Now we must lend our power to Thiernax and the others, and hope Tyrande survives."
8210,
8211,"Link to the Maw : The Fatescribe is certain that a second waystone has emerged in the Maw. It falls to you to locate it.   I will create an anchor here in Oribos that links to your anima. Once you attune yourself to the waystone, this anchor will be bound to it.  If you are successful, the covenants will be able to send their forces inside and safely leave the Maw again.  Use what resources you have within the Maw to find this waystone.  Good luck, mortal. May the Purpose guide us all."
8212,"Forging a Champion : Of all the souls who have reached that stone, only you discovered its true purpose.  I am no zealot, but clearly there is a deeper meaning in this. We would be wise to investigate further.  Find Bonesmith Heirmir at her forge. She is the most renowned smith in Maldraxxus, and the last remaining apprentice of the Primus himself.  She will know what course to take."
8213,"Through the Veil : I like you, youngling. You put in the work while the others sit in their fancy court, leaving old Marasmius to keep the fae rings thriving.  Here, take one of my spores back with you to the Heart of the Forest. Find somewhere nice and cozy for me to rest, will you?  Come back and visit me whenever you like. Cort and I can keep an eye on things for now, but there will always be plenty for you to do here. Might even be something special in it for you."
8214,"Rule 3: Trust is Earned : Before you leave this cursed realm, there is one final task you must complete for me.  The Mawsworn regularly transfer souls to various blocks of Torghast from many different areas in the Maw.  I happen to know of one such area. Place this beacon there so I may be informed when the next transfer happens.  And if you are seen by the enemy... well, you are known for your prowess in combat, yes?"
8215,"Build One More : All these souls deserve a new construct, and when rebuilt any of them will make a valuable addition to our forces.  We must start somewhere.   You should be able to find Malleable Flesh through out the Shadowlands. A few of the other parts may be harder to locate.  Collect parts and use the Abominable Stitching Table to build another construct."
8216,"Deep Within : Who... who are you? Have you come to extract more of my memories?I'm afraid there aren't any useful ones left, save for the memories of my imprisonment.Or perhaps you're here for something else?"
8217,"WANTED: Lord Darion : To Whom it May Concern:   Lord Darion of House Redelav thinks that he can buy his place in society.   He flaunts his wealth, using it to win favor of other lords and ladies. Is there no price on decency?   This is not the way the noble houses of Revendreth should conduct themselves.   I implore you to find Lord Darion and help him meet his true death.   The honor of House Briarbane rests in your capable hands.  Warmest Regards,   Duke Anton of House Briarbane"
8218,Guise of the Changeling : <Your familiarity with the Archivists' Codex makes it clear that this is one of the missing relics.  Archivist Roh-Suir has a spot for this mask in the Reliquary of Remembrance.>
8219,"Daughter of the Night Warrior : In my dreams, I see many things. Elven souls tortured in the Maw. A warrior of the night consumed by vengeance.  And... Ardenweald's destruction.  These visions are ever shifting... ever vague. But I believe Tyrande Whisperwind is key to saving the night elves, as well as this realm.  Shandris Feathermoon, Tyrande's daughter, is touched by dreams as well.  Even now, she travels to the Eternal City. Find her. If anyone can reach the heart of Tyrande, it is her."
8220,"Maldraxxian Weapons : <The weapon you find seems unlike those wielded by most venthyr, yet the marks it bears are unmistakably familiar...  It would be wise to seek out more such weapons and bring them to the Accuser.>"
8221,"Steward at Work : Stewards are useful for many reasons.  They keep Bastion tidy, fix anything broken, and offer unrivaled companionship and support.  Your new steward assistant should be able to repair the beacon. Then you can summon the Polemarch to Hero's Rest."
8222,
8223,"Cleansing the Forest : The Winter Queen has commanded us to drive Mueh'zala's forces out of Ardenweald.  This won't be an easy battle. The death loa's army is strong, and several of our hunters have been gravely injured.  Can we count on you to turn the tide in our favor, <name>?  Aid our fallen allies and vanquish Mueh'zala's minions!"
8224,"Grab Bag : Interesting. Aural sequencers and an ethereal cloak. You hang on to those, <name>. I have a suspicion they will prove useful.  Ah, and something special for me as well. If I'm not mistaken--and I so rarely am--this is a projection mechanism. Very handy!  And what's this? A transportation device of some kind. We should test it immediately.  By ""we,"" of course I mean you."
8225,"By Your Leave : I have a task set before me by my Baroness, Lady Vashj. With assistance, my vengeance would be swift. But she must approve of your help as well as my release to assist you with your task.  Go to the Seat of the Primus. There we will speak with her."
8226,"Imminent Danger : The Temple of Courage must not fall!  All kyrian learn to fight in its hallowed halls. Not only to protect Bastion, but to ensure their own safety when retrieving souls from across the veil.   Travel there at once. Seek out Thanikos, the Paragon of Courage's loyal hand."
8227,"Wake The Sleepers : The land speaks to me, <name>. Ardenweald is a realm of cycles, but it has never faced an anima drought such as this.  We will need the aid of all who reside here if we are to make it through this crisis.  Many souls slumber within the forests and hills. If they can provide us some of their anima, we may be able to endure a little longer. Should you encounter any of the souls in your travels, please awaken them and send them to me."
8228,"Under the Illusion : The Fatescribe has collected the necessary items to create an illusion in this chamber. Fortunately, we can use his own implement to dispel it and reveal him.  He will be grateful to see a friendly face, I'm sure.  I must say, you've proven to be incredibly helpful in this task. I truly couldn't have done it without you."
8229,"Vengeance for Korthia : While opening the vault is our priority, I  must ask a favor.  When Korthia was pulled into the Maw, my people were terrified. We fled to the area you see before you, a place of peace called the Scholar's Den.  The Mawsworn soon descended upon us. Most of my kind were slaughtered. Others were taken captive.  If I could claim vengeance myself, I would. But I... I am ill-equipped for battle. Not like you.  Please. Show these monsters that their defilement of Korthia will not stand!"
8230,"The Anima Trail : So the Jailer seeks the Primus's sigil. We must beat the Mawsworn to it. To open the vault, we need to power it with anima.  You helped the Bonesmith repair the first conduit. The trail of anima in front of us leads to the next.   If we can activate it, then there should be enough anima flowing into Korthia to get us inside the vault.  Come, we must make haste!"
8231,
8232,"Return to Adrestes : Baine suffers within Torghast, but at least we know that he yet lives.  Rushing to his rescue would prove disastrous without a plan of attack. I will see to preparing one.  In the meantime, I suggest you bring the souls you rescued to Elysian Hold.  The kyrian are vital to the Shadowlands. If Bastion remains in turmoil, then all might soon be lost."
8233,"Acid Reflux : We will need to be properly prepared before we can face Voras.  The digestive juices of Ardenweald's gorm dissipate the anima in their food. Ingesting them causes devourers no small discomfort.  For a beast of that size, we will need a lot of it to have any effect. There should be plenty of gorm in the hive to the east.  Long ago, an artisan gave me a tool that he said would be useful against the gorm, should I ever need it. You may borrow it."
8234,
8235,Aiding the Shadowlands : There is much to do within the Shadowlands. Many areas are suffering from the anima drought.  The choice of who to help first is yours. Where will you go?
8236,"A Good Heart : Despite the beliefs of most people, Emeni has a kind heart.  Err...at least she will have one, once you give it to her!  I can think of no one better than you, Maw Walker, to give Emeni a new heart. Perhaps this will warm her blood towards you. You might become friends or even soulbinds!  Please select and place a heart in Emeni's construct."
8237,"Snacks for Stonehead : <Stonehead has amassed a wide variety of half-eaten oddities.  He'd certainly appreciate you bringing some new, creative snacks for him to try.>"
8238,"An Escapist Novel : <Action, adventure, thrills, chills... This book has it all! Penned by a mortal soul who led an amazing life, this book is a page-turner.   But is it true? Could one person fight conspiracies, ancient evils, vast enemy armies, demons and even gods in a single lifetime?  On further reflection, it could be true, but what is a ""duck"" this book speaks of? That part sounds fake.  Still... it was a good story. Archivist Dreyden would probably be pleased to have his book back.>"
8239,"The Sundered Staff : I have no choice but to trust you with the secrets of the Lodestaff.  In the right hands, such as those of a trained Archivist, the staff can locate influential relics from the afterlives of the Shadowlands.  It was split into three segments to ensure that it would not fall into the wrong hands. The invaders have found the pieces, but they are yet not aware of their significance.  Recover the pieces of the staff. Each segment is held by a different member of the Mawsworn."
8240,Sack of Strange Soil : <Your familiarity with the Archivists' Codex makes it clear that this is one of the missing relics.  Archivist Roh-Suir has a spot for this soil in the Reliquary of Remembrance.>
8241,A Job Done Right : We should be clear to start the assault.  Signal the Zerekriss. Let us show them the might of a Maldraxxian necropolis and the combined armies of the Shadowlands!
8242,"Herald's Footpads : Sometimes, sheer force of will is not enough. A piece of equipment can save your life.  This blueprint you found can teach you to craft your first piece of equipment.  Bring it over to Dactylis. She will be able to aid you in this as well."
8243,"Casting Doubt : <A note has been left here for Kel'Thuzad. It does not appear that he has read it.>  Baron, I do not trust your new favorite acolyte. Something has been off about them ever since they returned from their ritual with the Kyrian remains.  Your work is too important to allow such discrepancies. The acolyte should be disposed of.  Faithfully,  Sorcerer Vutral"
8244,Gravewing Crystal : <This large crystal fragment shattered off of the massive construct's body. Flashes of energy crackle inside of it.  The Stonewright in Keeper's Respite would be able to use this crystal to empower a gravewing for you.>
8245,"Finding One's True Purpose : All our efforts have led us here.  With the combined wisdom of the Archivists, and a little help from a <race> <class>, we will attune the Lodestaff to the relics that we seek.  Should we succeed, we will have what we need to re-establish the Archive.  Our sacred work can then continue."
8246,"RSVP: Kleia and Pelagos : Oh, how wonderful! Thank you for the invitation to the Ember Court.  We were just going to go cleanse ourselves with a meditation. That will be even more necessary if we are to travel soon. Care to join us?"
8247,"Your Next Best Friend : You looking for a new friend? Hoo-hoo!  Lots of stewards who are happy to be friend. Plus, current friend can take break! Maybe go to Cliffs of Respite, rest feet, eat cake...  <Sika gets lost in a daydream.>  Hoo! Right!  I call stewards. You make new friend!"
8248,"More Wings! : Idea! Maybe I am too heavy. Maybe need more wings!  Glimmerflies have lovely wings. With correct bait and strong rope, perhaps we can catch.  Please bring Animyllis Blooms. Their nectar is delicious for glimmerflies, and makes them drowsy!"
8249,Memory of Honor : <A tablet sits embedded in the ground near a broken armor display.  The runes on the epitaph conjure images of an ancient warrior in your mind. Clearly Maldraxxus honors the history of those who claimed great victories here.  Similar memorials seem to be spread throughout the trench. Perhaps they can offer more insight into the denizens of this realm.>
8250,"Phaestus, Genesis of Aeons : Sika reports the Forsworn are widespread. They not only took over production, but the rise as well!  They organize their armies from the cliffs, send word back to their leaders.  They've ransacked our shrine to the First Forgelite and took her hammer. My hammer!  Defeat their commander, retrieve Phaestus. You must go now!"
8251,
8252,"Something Extra for the Winter Queen : Ya did good wit' how ya handled Mueh'zala. Me be wantin' ta return da favor. We be friends, after all... riiiight?  Dat nasty loa be at me mercy now. Him been mutterin' about some tings he stole from ya Winter Queen.   Come along ta me Necropolis. Ya can see what Ol' Bwonsamdi be talkin' about for yaself.  Ya gonna come back with someting nice for her majesty... reeeeeal nice."
8253,"A Matter of Urgency : Maw Walker, there is a matter of urgency that has not been addressed.  Our Fatescribe is missing. They have not found their way here. They would have been in Seeker's Quorum before...  <Pathscribe Roh-Vess pauses.>  Can you look for the Fatescribe? Many attendants used the caves near the ruins to hide from the mawsworn."
8254,"WANTED: Darkwing : The Cloudfeather matriarch, Darkwing, has fallen to a great and terrible sickness. She has grown aggressive, dominating her children and driving them to violence.  Darkwing must be slain if her flock is to ever return to the Archon's grace.  Please use the attached whistle to call her to her nest. I shall consider one of her crown feathers sufficient proof of the deed.  --Eumelia, Stable Master"
8255,
8256,"A Taste of Tirna Noch : I'm a simple mushroom with simple pleasures, <name>. And what's simpler than a nice, hearty meal?Don't look so surprised. I need to eat just like anyone else! How else do you think I grew so big? Nice, tasty compost, that's how!Back in my day, I had the pick of Ardenweald for where to feed. Now, not so much.I've had a hankering for some of the loam that used to be around Tirna Noch. I haven't had shoots out there in a long time. Could you bring me some?"
8257,"We Need More Power : Laurent's plan is a bit ambitious.   Mirrors are most reliable when used to traverse short distances. Traveling to the sanctuary will require a great deal of power, more than he or I have.   The shrouded have stores of anima in their compound. With enough of it, the mirror should be stable enough to get us where we need to go."
8258,"Forest Disappearances : A moment of your time, friend?A short while ago a sylvar named Partik came seeking the aid of our grove. He said his village was under attack by the gorm and was in danger of crumbling away altogether. I told him we could not spare any soldiers, but their people were welcome to take refuge with us.However, it has been some time since he left and I have not seen or heard anyone from that region since.Can you go investigate? He came from the northeast."
8259,"Winter's Sigil : My sister... After all this time... She did not abandon me...  <The barest hint of a smile graces the Winter Queen's face before it is gone. She turns her attention to you with the weight of eons.>  Attend me, <name>. Take my sister's tear, and come to the Heart of the Forest."
8260,"Mawsplaining : There remains one task now before the glorious battle can begin. The horn must be anchored to the Maw so that its voice may pierce the barrier that surrounds that foul realm.   How this can be done, I do not know. Seek out one that understands the mysteries of that place. Surely they can guide your hand.  Danica and her sisters will listen for Ilskahorn's call. They will answer when you need them, <name>."
8261,"Secrets of the Vault : What fortune! You rescued the record keepers before the Mawsworn could steal their knowledge of the vault's relics.  But their records are fragmented. Incomplete. I pray there's enough left to learn the truth.  I will attempt to coalesce the knowledge that remains into a message. If the Purpose wills it, we will learn what the Jailer wants and to whom this item originally belonged.  I must focus for a moment. Let me know when you are ready to begin."
8262,"Forsworn and Forgotten : Wait... I know you! The Maw Walker!  My brothers and sisters have been twisted... tainted. Some took power willingly from Helya, but others resisted. Now all of us are forced to submit to her power.  I escaped when the fighting started, but most of the remaining Forsworn are being subjected to horrific rituals.  Please, I beg you to free them. Then we will return to Bastion and submit to the Archon's judgment."
8263,
8264,"Working for the Living : I see you are wondering where we acquire all of the challengers we supply to this arena.  We scour countless realms in search of opponents to provide the Maldraxxi with firsthand combat experience.   Currently, I am in the process of procuring a new combatant--and with it, a lucrative betting opportunity.   Would you make use of our portal and assist Zo'umlo in capturing Khogov the Expunger? You will be appropriately compensated, of course."
8265,"Hyphae Patrol: The Stalks : <Marasmius sighs.>   They're at it again, up in the Stalks.Seems like we didn't give them enough of a thrashing the first time, eh? What say you and I team up again and teach those younglings a lesson they won't forget?Let me know when you're ready and we'll get 'em, just like before!"
8266,"All I Ever Will Be : This is the site of an ancient battle won by the previous Paragon of Courage. She sacrificed herself to serve the Shadowlands. I only hope my own end will prove as exemplary.  Many of my disciples meditate upon the scrolls here. With them, we remember the foundation of our courage.  Accompany Alexandros as he reflects on his shrines. Aid him in understanding where the source of his courage lies.  He will learn that this afterlife is not the one suited for him."
8267,"Killing the Messenger : I make it my business to know what is going on within my district.   Traditionally we use stone fiends to relay messages, but my informants have alerted me to some suspicious communications going on within the Old Gate.   A venthyr has been hired to run missives between two undisclosed parties. When someone puts that much effort into concealing their identity, it can never be good.  Find this courier and recover whatever missives they might be carrying."
8268,"Follow the Path : Maldraxxus must answer for their crimes against Bastion. There shall be justice!  Let us go to Oribos and speak with the Tal-Inara, the Honored Voice. We will tell her what has transpired this day. Tell her that the kyrian will not stand idle against this aggression.  Artemede will inform the Archon. My brothers and sisters will surely prepare for war.  That must not come to pass."
8269,"Deadly Reminder : Our defense is tenuous at best, but the enemy is still hesitant to attack.  As long as they fear us, they won't be probing our defenses.   You must keep the pressure on the enemy.  Attack their positions all along our line."
8270,"Kyrestia's Grace : I remember this particular soul...Uther. Devos brought him before us some time ago. She pleaded her case about his soul having a connection to the Maw.  She then took him under wing, ascending him before he was ready. He became her other hand alongside Lysonia, as it were.  He may proclaim a change of heart, but we shall see. Place him under guard. He may stay by the Archon's grace, but I will not take any chances with one so...broken."
8271,"Rule 2: Keep a Low Profile : Though you may wish to depart with your precious souls in tow, we now have additional matters to settle first.  The Eye of the Jailer is upon you. And that does not bode well for either of us.  Take this device. You will reinforce my wards to ensure he does not take notice of me as well.  The last thing I need is a loud, inelegant mortal bringing more attention my way. I can't have the Jailer capturing me, after all.  I'm far too valuable."
8272,"Securing Sinfall : They're all still active...  The stoneborn, the gargon, the stone fiends... All of 'em!  Don't got much time. They're always watching.  <Breakfist points up.>  Vulca told me to follow that big beam of Light in the sky.  Goes to a tower guarded by a big old brute, though. Couldn't get in."
8273,"Breaking a Few Eggs : As you can see, we have a gorm problem.I'm not sure what has them so riled up. They've been getting bigger, more hostile. It must be due to the anima drought. If nothing stops them, they'll eat everything!Their egg production is out of control. We can't let their population grow any larger. Please, go in to their nests and destroy as many of their eggs as you can find."
8274,The Last Guy : You're not the first newcomer wanting to become famous. There've been a lot like you around!   The last few wanted to prove themselves by killing a giant bloodtusk... none of them ever returned! You want to get recognition?  Go find all those missing newcomers and kill the bloodtusk yourself.
8275,"The Maw : $p, your arrival has set Maldraxxus ablaze. If you have any honor, you will do as I ask.  I believe I know where our answers may lie. The baron preceding Draka was lost to the Maw. It is said you have entered that dark abyss... and returned.  If the baron survived, he may know our next course of action.  You came here from Oribos. Return there, and see if you can find a way back to the Maw."
8276,"The First New Growth : Long have we lain dormant. With souls, with anima, we grow once more.   A choice now awaits. How shall we grow? You may decide which flower blooms first.  In time, with more anima and willing souls, the whole garden will prosper. For now, a single blossom signals hope for the future.  Lady Moonberry will want to know of your choice. Seek her out once it is made."
8277,"Who Shapes the Forest : You have fulfilled your calling, Maw Walker, and brought calm to our forest.  Stay vigilant, for others will similarly call upon you in time.  The anima you have recovered will be of great use to the Heart of the Forest. Bring it to Zayhad. They will ensure it is safe until it is needed. You will find them deep in the roots of the Heart of the Forest."
8278,"Medallion of Avarice : The Medallion of Avarice was the tool of the Curator.  With its power it granted her authority over the Catacombs Ward. Combined with her knowledge of the vast library of sinstones Revendreth has accumulated over the ages, the Curator was a master of her craft.  When Denathrius defeated my first rebellion, he tossed both myself and the Curator into the Maw.   The Curator was clever, though, and she hid the medallion before Denathrius could act. Come, let us speak of plans."
8279,"Archival Protection : The rarest volumes are kept at the top of this tower, protected by an entity called the Archivist.  This stoic guardian is incorruptible. Intractable. Completely uninterested in striking a fair bargain!  Its utter lack of business acumen is really quite upsetting.  Ah, well. I fear we have no choice but to dispatch this impediment. Shall we?"
8280,Necrolord Assault : The Jailer's forces  have been caught off guard by our attack. We shall overrun Perdition Hold and defeat his champions at the Altar of Domination!  Your help is needed Maw Walker. Assist our forces on the battlefield!
8281,Sundered Souls : The traps... they didn't affect us before. Too many souls... escaping.   They... made new traps... tear apart fleeing souls...  ...too late for me. Destroy... so others might escape!
8282,"Weapon of Mass Construction : We are in luck!  Surgeon Stitchflesh and his assistant have not returned from Bastion.  The entire Stitchyard is lightly guarded.  We must work fast. See if you can get the equipment operational. Once it is active, we can begin the construction process."
8283,
8284,"The Blade of the Primus : That's everything I need. Time to get to work.  I'd stay close, if I were you. Forging a weapon is never a simple task when the Primus's handiwork is involved.  If he taught me anything, it was to expect the unexpected."
8285,Back to The Heart : We should hurry back to Ardenweald!  You go on ahead and find Ysera. I'll escort the Stonewright there and make sure Huln gets back.
8286,"Signs of the Lion : Thanks to your efforts, Thrall, Jaina Proudmoore, and Baine Bloodhoof are safe. Yet so long as the Jailer holds any hero of Azeroth, I fear he has power over us all.  It seems Anduin has been taken deeper into the tower than the others. Before I risk peering inside, you must make one last attempt to find him.  You say the Jailer spoke of honing a weapon. I fear we are running out of time.  Do not relent, <name>. Search the twisting corridors of Torghast for any sign of the Young Lion."
8287,"Dismantling the Opposition : The Forsworn mobilize!  We cannot allow them to march.  Attune to Bron, share your power with him.  Between the three of us, we shall destroy this new centurion army!"
8288,"Parting Ways : Me don't know what fate be comin' for ol' Vol'jin... but it be waitin' for me in Ardenweald.  Ashamane, Hir'eek, Shadra... dey belong dere, too.  We best be gettin' outta here. Me had enough of da Maw for an eternity."
8289,"The Power of the Maw : Lysonia flees to the Maw to enact her dark rituals. As the Maw Walker, you are the only one who can pursue her.  Take Kleia and my blade. She must be stopped."
8290,"Unsafe Workplace : You've returned just in time! Fae are in danger!It seems our actions have enraged the gorm. They are even more aggressive than they were before!While some fae were able to evacuate, there are still many who are trapped down there.Take this jar and slather anyone you find with a generous helping. That should heal their wounds and give them a chance to escape."
8291,"The Hunt Watches : The Wild Hunt protects. Many eyes watch for danger. Many ears listen for secrets.  Watcher Vesperbloom directs the eyes and ears of the forest.  Seek out our new growth, then turn to her for guidance."
8292,"A Hate-Hate Relationship : When the first of my sisters went missing, we were concerned. Those sent to find her did not return. Nor did the next.  What we have discovered is a dreadful betrayal by someone we once trusted.  Come, we must tell Odyn what we have witnessed in the Maw.  His wrath will be great."
8293,"Sanctum Upgrade: Mirror Network : Right. So, we got a Scroll of Dark Empowerment ready for youz that should manifest 'em mirror frames for you. Pre'y standard work.  Thing is, after you going to need a proper mirror maker to get 'em up an' workin'.   Prince Renathal might know a fang with the right skills. Best speak with him."
8294,"Disrupting the Chain : From the desk of the Tithelord:  All supply carriages must re-route to Stonevigil for collection assistance. Once complete, you may resume your regularly scheduled routes."
8295,"The Pupil Returns : Now that you have your disguise--and I have assurance of your loyalty--it is time you reported to your new master.  Find Kel'Thuzad within the Vault of Souls. Do whatever tasks he requires of you, but keep your eyes open for anything untoward.  My oculus will continue to accompany you so that I can provide guidance when the time is right.  We will uncover this new baron's true intentions."
8296,"Survivors of Heartwood Grove : Korenth... I can't believe he's...  We have to save whomever we can. Droman Krelnor is too strong for us to face alone.  I saw a few other survivors scattered around the grove. Hurry, we have no time to waste!"
8297,"Idle Hands : If you want my help then you are going to need to help me first.There is a group of spriggans that have assaulted the growthworks to the northeast. They are causing all manner of havoc and I simply will not abide this trespass into my lands.Go there and teach them a lesson. If they will not flee, then slay them on the spot!"
8298,"Rallying Maldraxxus : We need all the help we can get! It's taking all we have to hold our ground against the other houses, let alone gain any ground against them.  Truth be told, your blade will be welcome anywhere. There are no shortage of battles to be won, foes to be toppled, or weary soldiers to be relieved.  Help us regain control of Maldraxxus, and in the name of the Primus I will see you are amply rewarded."
8299,Hyphae Patrol: Gossamer Cliffs : Bad news from the Gossamer Cliffs. We need to help.The varmints terrorizing the poor silk striders have become more cruel and aggressive lately. The silk striders are important to Ardenweald; more important than almost anyone else knows. We can't lose any more.Let me know when you're ready to go and we'll scare those gits away for good!
8300,"The Heart of the Forest : I knew we were gonna get along! Welcome to our covenant. Well, almost.  There's just a few details left. Little things. You know. Oaths to be made, blood pacts to sort out, firstborns to be promised.  <Moonberry snorts a laugh.>  I'm just kidding!  Well, not about the oaths part. We take those seriously around here.  I'll meet you at the camp outside the Heart of the Forest!"
8301,"Celestial Shadowlands Chart : <You recognize this relic from the Archivists' Codex.  The mawsworn discarded it, believing it to be useless.  And the chart is useless, without the accompanying data to plot the relative locations of Shadowlands afterlives. If the research were retrieved from deceased scholars, the chart could be returned to the Archivist, fully functional.>"
8302,"Shadow's Fall : Despite our efforts, the Void stands strong. All of the forces of Bastion fight, and fall one by one...  The Void cannot destroy us!  They are led by Tezulat the Annihilator, scourge of a thousand realms. This day, his reign of terror will end!"
8303,"The Night Market : <Dracho motions to keep your voice down.>  I need some assistance, I promise you will be paid handsomely.   At the edge of The Banewood lies some ruins. These ruins are home to a marketplace run by some brokers. They won't let me back there. Let's just say that my goods were deemed to not be up to their authenticity metrics.   But you... you're a Maw Walker! Bring them this package and exchange it for some Surberries from Ardenweald.   Just don't say I sent you."
8304,"Things They Leave Behind : Chordy bored. Chordy want to go on adventure! You want to go too, yes?  Pale people in tall buildings have many shinies and luckydos. We go there and find some for ourselves!  You ready to go?"
8305,"Stonevigil Unrest : Greetings, <name>. I'm sure you've met my associate, Baroness Draka.  I have recruited her to help us with the growing threat of the Tithelord.  His involvement with the Maldraxxi renegades is troubling.  One conspiracy begets another. So I recruited Draka to help us end it.  We must not treat this situation lightly. We first need to put an end to his oppression of Stonevigil Overlook. That way we can we win over the hearts and minds of his subjects."
8306,"A Suitable Demise : Surviving in this miserable place has been difficult, but I must confess... sending a few Mawsworn to a suitable demise does bring me joy.  The soulforgers in Zovaal's Cauldron are among the cruelest minions the Jailer employs. I find satisfaction in disposing of their cores in the very forges which they maintain.  This of course has the added benefit of temporarily slowing down their arms production, if you require more sober justification for your actions."
8307,"Her Rightful Place : Mor'Bitan has met his end... and a painful one at that.  Your fortitude contributed in no small part to my success. You have earned my allegiance... for the time being.   There is much left to do, should you truly desire ownership of this realm.  Let us regroup at the Seat."
8308,"A Touch of Humility : With the Temple of Humility under our control, its power shall flow back into the Crest of Ascension once more.  Join me below so that we may witness it together. Mikanikos has ensured it will become even more magnificent as its power grows."
8309,"Keys to the Ruin : At last, our target is within reach.  The necropolis rests above us, moored to this platform by a necrotic restraining bolt.  Twigin can fly you to the apex of the necropolis. It will be ours to command once you insert this keystone.  We will prepare for our departure. Rejoin us when you are done.  Victory will soon be ours."
8310,"Fangcrack's Fan Club : Fangcrack is the strongest dredger I e'er seen! He's incredible!  He's down there, reaching into dat big Torghast portal, pulling the baddies right out o' their home!  They don't even know what's happenin' half the time, ha ha!  Me and Cudgelface joined his fan club soon as we got here.  You want in? You gotta earn your membership same as everyone else: go down there and fight whatever he pulls out of the portal!"
8311,"If Even One is Worthy : I have seen firsthand that worthy souls have been unjustly cast into Maw.  Gresit here was almost cast in himself by the Lord Chamberlain's minion. He has more than proven himself under my care.  Look among the souls that the Jailer's filth have deemed ""unworthy"". Inspect each to confirm that they deserve their fate.  Even if we examine every soul in the Tremaculum and find only a single worthy one to bring back to Revendreth, it will still be valuable."
8312,"A Conduit for Growth : While our bond is powerful in and of itself, you can also enhance it through the use of conduits.  Conduits channel the anima between soulbinds in many different ways, increasing both of our potential in the process. They allow us to attune ourselves to each other's unique strengths.  Let's use a few now. If they can further empower our bond, then they can aid us in protecting the forest."
8313,"From a Dark Place : You rescued some of the night elves from the Maw before. While the danger is still great, I must ask you to do it again.  I have to believe that we can save them. As many of them as possible.  Please, go and see if you can recover any more lost souls."
8314,"We Strike Now : The time has come. The Wild Hunt has driven the Drust back to their stronghold at the edge of Ardenweald.  Their scouts report that Gorak Zhar herself is among them. This may be our only opportunity to fully purge the minions of Thros from this realm.  Lord Herne awaits your arrival at the battlefront. Go with haste, <name>."
8315,"The End and the Beginning : I am so happy you restored our connection to the Queen's Conservatory!  In light of this accomplishment, the Winter Queen has requested you attend her at the Grove of Awakening!   You will see first hand the purpose of Ardenweald and gain a greater understanding of our sacred charge before you too, take it upon yourself.  Hurry! Don't keep everyone waiting!"
8316,"Their New Home : It pains me to leave my mother behind... but the souls of my people must be brought to safety.  I heard the attendants in Oribos speaking of a place called Ardenweald. A realm of ancient forests where the spirits of nature slumber.  This is a land you know well, is it not? I would see its wonders with my own eyes.  Perhaps the spirits there will know how to save my minn'do from the Night Warrior's power."
8317,Magical Mystery Tour! : <Lady Moonberry's voice rises from the scroll.>  <name>! It seems Huln got into some trouble. And--well--it's complicated. We could really use your help in Revendreth! Please meet me at Dominance Keep.  See you soon!
8318,"The Proper Souls : We must save as many souls as we can from the fate we have just witnessed.  Search the halls for souls who have escaped the Lord Chamberlain's perverse rituals. Subjugate them and bring them to me inside the Halls of Atonement.  Together, we will make certain that each soul is appropriately processed and cared for."
8319,"I Could Be A Contender : Hold up there, <brother/sister>.   If you are serious about fighting in the Arena you're going to need a manager.  Lucky for you, <brother/sister>, I know a guy. He's just had some openings in his roster of fighters and you look like just the type of <class> he needs to fill his ranks.  Name is Louison, you can find him at the gate just east of here.  Tell him I sent ya, <brother/sister>."
8320,"And Then There Were None : Ilka and Samu argued, you say? And you found a coded message indicating that the tithe was going to be sent out soon. Those are helpful clues that will allow me to put the puzzle together.   It's clear to me now who betrayed the village and what we need to do about it! You deliver invitations to a meeting to our suspects and I'll prepare to reveal the traitor."
8321,"Lost Vaults : I have finished my research on more relics that may still exist in Korthia. I believe they are still within our smaller vaults.  With your help, I can recreate devices that are capable of repairing the entrances to these vaults.  Take note of the echoes of relics that are still missing. Please review them so you know what to look for."
8322,"Sanguine Depths: An Ally Within : There are whispers of a prisoner within these depths that may be of use to our cause.   Whether this information can be relied upon is unknown. It is just as likely to be a trap, but still, we must investigate.  We cannot afford to ignore an opportunity such as this.   Venture into the Sanguine Depths and recover this valuable prisoner."
8323,"Whisper of Hope : Akarek's demise has cast a dark shadow upon our house... but it is in the shadows where we thrive.  I know that not all the Eyes have perished. They could lie in wait, hidden for eternity, if such was demanded of them.  But it is time to reclaim our destiny. Take my sigil through the wreckage and awaken any Eyes who remain.  We will seize our victory."
8324,"A Valuable Find: De Other Side : Mueh'zala has been around for many generations, how many exactly we cannot say. His domain is a land of mystery to us all.   But we are a people of probabilities and margins. A creature of that age, with such power, and the many ancient souls within his domain, has a great chance to be in possession of a relic of unfathomable rarity.  <The light around Ta'lan's head flares brightly for a moment. He seems... excited?>  Slay the foolish creature, bring me his secrets, I will reward you handsomely!"
8325,"Dredger Duty : You fixed up the muck pool so we can make some dredgers, but them devourers are gonna keep causin' trouble.  We're gonna need a Gem of Binding so we can dredge up a biggun to protect the pool.  I'll show you how to dredge up some disposable dredgers to work with for now.  Get 'em digging in the rubble to find us a Gem of Binding, and then we'll reshape 'em all into a biggun to kick them devourers outta here!"
8326,"Ember Court: Lost Chalice Band : Hips was smart to send you my way. The Lost Chalice Band plays the best music this side of the Maw!  The band is not quite ready to tour yet, however.  The musicians are all safe in the crypt behind me, but their instruments have been confiscated by our obnoxious neighborhood authorities!  Noise complaints and all that.  Help me get those back, and perhaps recruit a few groupies and roadies along the way to help out, and we shall throw the best concert your court has ever seen!"
8327,"Call In a Favor : We will do just as my baroness commands. Let us conjure a helmsman before us... however displeased it might make her.  Activate the beacon and prepare yourself for a fight. The liches regard all Eyes as their enemies, and I am certain your reputation among them does you no favors."
8328,"Garden in Turmoil : Please excuse me for not standing. I would rather not disturb these creatures.  If you have a desire to help the creatures of Bastion, Zosime needs aid to regain control of our garden. You will find her just down this path.  Go in service."
8329,"Through the Fire and Flames : Margrave Krexus was pleased to hear of your service to our house. He senses great potential within you.  Potential that must be tested.  A stone stands at the center of our citadel, surrounded by magma. Reaching the stone is a challenge of endurance and fortitude.  This trial is usually attempted only by our most renowned soldiers, but Margrave Krexus commands you to attempt the rite at once.  Go on, then. Prove your worth."
8330,"A Mycelial Network : Anima flows into the deepest of roots, feeding the mushrooms. Long has it been since we used the rings to travel across Ardenweald.  Restore our connection to the mushroom network."
8331,"The Right Stuff : Building something that can help in your mission will require some metal.  The constructs of the Forsworn have metal parts, suitable for what we need. Tainted by the Forsworn, they will need some additional work.  Collect their metal and smelt them in the flames of the Eternal Forge to purge the corruption."
8332,"Sins of the Past : The Countess built her reputation on being a native venthyr, never a soul.  Revealing her sinstone to the world would be catastrophic. This is the leverage we need for the information we seek.  She will tell us where Alwin is. Where the seal is.  This mirror leads to her estate. I will follow behind you as backup, but the kyrian shall wait here.  Don't let her threaten you. You hold the power."
8333,"Setting the Ground Rules : Back to rescue more souls? How intrepid.  Though I must say, your earlier escapade has drawn the Jailer's attention... and his ire. After all, none have successfully eluded him before.   Except for me.  Now his forces are on high alert, hunting down any errant souls that the fabled Maw Walker may try to steal from him.  It has made things quite... inconvenient for me. If you and I are going to work together, we need to set a few ground rules.  And you must be properly equipped."
8334,"The Princeguard : Renathal carries himself well, but hides great pain. His wounds from Denathrius have not healed.  He is vulnerable.  He intends to send you to secure his old fortress of Darkwall Tower with banners and rely on his own strength to deter enemies. This is a poor tactical choice.  Take this small reserve of anima with you and revive Chelra the Bladewall. She was last seen at Darkwall. Revive her and she can aid you in taking the tower."
8335,We Can Rebuild Him : Gatamatos needs numerous repairs to meet functional standards.  Upkeeping phalynx is part of the role. Lend a hand so we may finish the repairs thoroughly and quickly.
8336,"Aerial Advantage : Gharmal's rocs dominate the skies above, striking at our forces as we advance. We cannot move the necropolis into position until they are cleared out!  I would slaughter them myself, but the cowards remain out of reach, and I am not constructed for flight.  You, however, seem slight enough of build. Take my riding hook and latch onto a roc.   Once you are atop of one, beat it to a pulp. Worry about the landing later."
8337,"Loose Threads : We're missing a few tools and parts for sewing a construct. We need these items if we're to rebuild my construct!  Search the surrounding area. See if you can find us what we need.  Search tables for the Skewering Needles, you can find haulers that carry Razorthread Spools, and look for Clotting Patches on constructs you kill."
8338,"Kivarr the Thornspeaker : In my youth, I was mentored by a wise and powerful Thornspeaker named Kivarr. She passed from this world long ago, but her soul may yet rest within the Shadowlands.  Kivarr's knowledge is ancient and vast, far eclipsing my own. She may be able to offer you the guidance that I cannot.  Seek her out. Deliver the fetish to her. She will know what to do.  May the wind be your guide."
8339,"Back into the Darkness : Souls continue to pour into the Maw, and with them the anima that could help us.  You were able to rescue me from that place. Can I count on your strength to repeat the same trick? Please, get us more willing souls so we can bolster this sanctum's power.  Seek out what aid you can and do what we can't, Maw Walker. You are our last, best, hope."
8340,"You Cannot Hide : There are those who held their affiliation with Kel'Thuzad secret even after he made his move. They too were involved in the fall of my Margrave, and they too shall die.  I have one name, Drava'ora, but there are more. Sin'dane had indicated these traitors carry marks of favor. She doesn't know who has them so we'll start killing until we find them.  The rest will see the example made."
8341,"Path of Ascension: Mad Mortimer : Your soulbinds request your strategic mind in another trial.  Their sights this week are set on Mad Mortimer, that they may learn from the lessons his memory teaches.  When you are able, report to Artemede to return to the Path of Ascension. Aid your soulbinds in defeating Mad Mortimer to prove their growth."
8342,"A Calling in Revendreth : We got a lot of problems out there, boss. Big ones, little ones, really smelly ones, it's a lot.  If we're gonna take on Denathrius, the first thing we gotta do is clean up right here in Revendreth.  We get things cleaned up, yeah? Then we get some new allies, and we probably get our hands on some anima to boot.  It's a call to action, it is. And it's important that we get started right away.  Get on out there and get your boots muddy!"
8343,
8344,"Feathers of Flight : Now, let us see this next to my arm...  Look! There many long feathers along the edges of the Larion's wing!  And none on mine. This is why I can not fly!  Hmm. It will take lots of flight feathers to give me wings.   You help?"
8345,"RSVP: Choofa : Oooh a party! I love parties.  My friends have to come too or it's just not as much fun. Ask them please! You need to find Awool, Rury, and Slanknen so we can go together."
8346,"Pie Not? : I want to cook something warm, savory, and gooey!  That's right! I want to make a lovely bone marrow pie! When it's done, you'll be as full as a tick. I guarantee it!   Now, just any old marrow won't do. I need the very best and rarest marrow.  And that's where you come in! I need you to help Mama out and dig that marrow up. Yes... dig.   Oh and be ready to knock some heads. Maldraxxus doesn't take kindly to being carved up."
8347,"Random Memory Access : When the Jailer snared Korthia and dragged it toward the Maw, he destroyed so much in this place. Not only mountains and buildings, but the people, too.  Those people had lives, hopes, memories.  I have to think that they can't all be gone, and we might be able to save something of them that lingers.  Here, take some of my power. See if you can collect those memories. Bring them to me, and I'll keep them safe.   No one should be forgotten."
8348,"Above My Station : While I indeed know the location of the Veiled Market, I fear I can do little in terms of providing you with transportation to it.  In return for your assistance with a task, I can send you to someone who can assist us both. There is a bounty hunter at Transfer Station Ta, a broker enclave in Bastion. He is better suited to help you... and he owes me a shipment.  Meet with Ta'oku and tell him that Ta'nla sent you.  For your convenience, I can offer use of a portal. After all, we are partners, yes?"
8349,"Shades of Muck : Yeah, this here muck pool's got everythin' we need to make your dredger butler.  We'll make this one special just for you. Made to specifications, as the fangs say.  First up, you gotta choose its color. Us dredgers comes in all kind of different shades of muck.  Take a peek at some me fellow dredgers and let me know what color we should dredge up for your butler.  We can recolor a dredger after-the-fact, but it ain't pleasant.  <Rendle shudders at the though.>"
8350,"The Ember Court : We've got everything we need to host our first real Ember Court whenever you're ready, Maw Walker.  Take a moment to finalize everything, and then we'll open court!  Remember, we're trying to impress Cryptkeeper Kassir and convince him that we know what we're doing, so make sure you choose the refreshments and entertainment we hired for him!  Once everything's ready, let me know and I'll open the court!"
8351,"Clearing the Walls : <This scroll shows the locations of a series of pylons, that protect Perdition Hold from assault.  Destroying these Pylons could aid in the success of our attack>"
8352,"The Fate of Ara'lon : <name>, I have an urgent request to make of you.  Recently, the Wild Hunt has been encountering the masked fae in greater numbers... particularly in the area surrounding Blackthorn Grove. I sent a hunting party to investigate, but they have yet to return.  Ara'lon was leading the hunt. You have offered him aid before, yes? I ask that you do so again.  Search the area for signs of the missing hunters and report back to me."
8353,"It Used to Be Quiet Here : Well... You don't look like the rest of 'em, do you?  <Chiselgrump shrugs.>  Doesn't bother me. Keep my head down and do my job, making sure these sinstones stay in good shape.  Keep breaking my tools, though.  Bring me some more chisels and I'll teach you an old dredger construction trick."
8354,"Disturbing the Peace : This anima drought isn't hard on just the kyrian. The wildlife of Bastion are suffering too!  Many creatures are becoming aggressive and menacing, wyrms and cloudfeathers especially. They are hurting the other wildlife and long beyond saving.  If someone doesn't clear this garden of these starved creatures, we can no longer meditate here. And if we can no longer meditate, that will make the anima shortage even worse!"
8355,"Anima-Laden Dreamcatcher : You stumble upon an enchanted dreamcatcher, placed so remotely that it has managed to collect a significant amount of anima without being harvested. Droman Dawnblossom in nearby Dreamsong Fenn would surely appreciate its safe return."
8356,"Precious Roots : Korthia. A sister forest, stricken.  But in the throes of destruction, there is still hope.   Gather the anima, and build anew."
8357,"Korthia Awaits : Ready yourself, <name>. Our allies await your arrival in Korthia."
8358,"Just Wing It : For untold ages, the humble Ardenmoth has supplied the scales for the creation of armor for the Wild Hunt.   Now, with our attention divided between the threats to the realm and the anima drought, it has become increasingly difficult for our foragers to find the perfect scales that we require.  Only the scales of the highest quality are suitable. If you should obtain any in your travels and return with them, I shall ensure you are well rewarded."
8359,"Mysterious Rifts : Thank you so much for your aid, <name>. I have uncovered more relics from the codex that remain intact.  The key to finding these relics rests within the strange rifts within Korthia.  I can now craft a way for you to enter these rifts, in order to gain access to these missing relics.  As before, take note of the echoes to understand what these relics look like. Please be sure to examine them before you depart."
8360,"Voices of the Eternal : <Bolvar peers at the grand figures before him, at the numberless gateways stretching out into the ether.>  This chamber is... truly wondrous.  Yet there is no time to be awestruck. The Honored Voice must begin this meeting at once."
8361,"Gathering The Hunt : Loath as I am to aid Bwonsamdi, Mueh'zala must be made to answer for his crimes.  We will eradicate his worshippers and drive them from the forest before they cause more harm.  Rally the groves and muster the Wild Hunt. Ardenweald has need of its protectors.  Make haste, <huntsman/huntress>."
8362,"Journey to Ardenweald : The warning you received from the Primus needs to reach the Winter Queen of Ardenweald, <name>. The Eternal Ones must stand together against the coming darkness.  The Winter Queen oversees the cycle between Death and Life. In her forest slumber ancient spirits of nature that must be reborn.  I fear the anima drought will have taken an especially grim toll upon her realm.   The night fae can lead you to the Queen. Bring her this message, and she will know what needs to be done."
8363,"The Problem with Containing a Death Loa : Me know Mueh'zala still be hidin' someting. Ol' Bwonsamdi gonna find out what dat be.  But dis old loa's presence be drawin' all da undead in Nazmir ta me doorstep!  Me be needin' some time ta get Mueh'zala talkin'.   Dere be a troll, Zel'han, leadin' da undead. Kill him and show Mueh'zala him broken armor.  Dat should end any hope he be havin' of escapin'."
8364,"Ossein Enchantment : A potent blade requires potent components. I know of something that would suit our needs.  Recently a monstrosity trained by the constructs was snared by our soldiers at the eastern side of our stronghold. Vyraz insists we can siphon ""intelligence"" from the beast's mind.  Hmph. The will of the Primus trumps the desires of an ambitious baron!  The bones of that beast would forge the perfect hilt for this blade. I say you lay claim to them."
8365,"Consulting the Experts : We can restore the functions of the Lodestaff, but it will require the wisdom of the Archivists.  Not just me, but the Archivists who have come before. They were laid to rest near here. Given the scale of the destruction of Korthia and the likely possibility that this destruction will continue, this may be our last chance to visit their memorials before they are irrevocably ruined.  Visit the Archivists' memorials. Take Roh-Suir with you, so that he may take note of their messages before they are lost."
8366,"Ember Court: Glimpse of the Wilds : It would be wonderful to show Revendreth the wild creatures of Ardenweald!  You can get some Radiant Groupers near the waterfalls. They're fast so you have to grab them as they swim by.   Here's a net to use to subdue the Territorial Waders. They should follow you once you've caught them.  Highland Runestags will let you ride them if you aren't aggressive. Bring a few here to me, please. Watch out for the bulls, they're not at all friendly.  We will get others to help too. This sounds like fun."
8367,"Watcher Emil : Watcher Emil is my trusted overseer of the catacombs. Before I was thrown into the Maw, half of the mirror was entrusted to him.  I had him stationed at the Catacombs of Regret. But I do not know where in the sprawl he is.  There is a guard station near the entrance to the catacombs. Start the search there. There is an officer who can help us, I--I can't remember who. That is, provided they survived this whole mess.  You must find Emil at once. We may not have much time."
8368,"Becoming the Hunt : <Reldorn grins at you.>  He knew you'd be back! The Horned Hunter went on ahead to prepare the hunting ground. He said you should join him as soon as you can.   Now that you have the materials for the trap, you just need to reach him...  It's dangerous territory to traverse, but I've been devising a glamour that should help you avoid the attention of the roaming beasts. Maybe if it's useful, you could put in a good word for...  Ahem. Anyway, we should focus on your quarry. Good hunting, friend."
8369,"Report to Draven : You have chosen well.  The Venthyr must return to their duty helping souls atone for their sins, saving them from an eternity in the Maw.  Denathrius's treachery must be righted. Speak with General Draven and begin your future with your covenant."
8370,"Enemy at the Door : The remaining houses of Maldraxxus have joined forces against us. Their armies besiege the Seat of the Primus, and our defenses cannot hold forever.  Our reserves have met the enemy in battle. I need you to break the siege.  Report to Heirmir and Marileth. They will give you the means to rain destruction on our foes."
8371,"The Sea of Souls : Some force here seeks to keep us from finding Tyrande.  The trail of bodies seems to go into this... stream of souls.   I suggest we split up. I will follow along the bank of the river. You enter its current and follow the trail.  Should you need me, I will be close at hand.  We will find Tyrande, no matter where this course leads."
8372,"A Thread Of Hope : The Court of Night is akin to a thirsty flower, it quickly draws up its nutrients. If well supplied it will bloom and if its supply is depleted, it withers.  Our roots are beginning to dry, we need more anima!  I've sent workers out to place silk lined catchers along the roads and paths that cross Ardenweald. These catchers will collect a tiny bit of anima, not much but enough for what we need.  Seek them out and return the Anima Infused Silk to us."
8373,
8374,
8375,"Welcome To Our House : Your ties to the other covenants had me doubting you would return. I see now that was foolish of me.  Outsider or not, you have stood bravely beside the armies of Maldraxxus. I am confident the Primus would have welcomed you into our ranks with pride.  One day, he might return as well. But we cannot afford to wait.   In the Primus's absence, I will name you a Necrolord of Maldraxxus."
8376,"Spoiling For A Fight : Your contribution of anima has aided our operation here greatly. Several of our more famous competitors have come here lured by the flow of new anima.  Would you like to test yourself versus the famous Sabriel? There could be much profit for everyone, if you were to defeat her.  I can add her to the schedule, she will appear soon if you defeat the other challengers."
8377,"Storm the Maw : We have been able to do little to stem the flood of souls into the maw, until now. You, Maw Walker, have the power to put a stop to this.  We know little about the Jailer's lands, save that he is powerful beyond imagining.  I ask something of you today that I would not place upon anyone else. You must travel to his lands, and do what you can to slow the growth of his forces.  We must buy more time."
8378,"Path of Ascension: Azaruux : Your soulbinds request your strategic mind in another trial.  Their sights this week are set on Azaruux, that they may learn from the lessons their memory teaches.  When you are able, report to Artemede to return to the Path of Ascension. Aid your soulbinds in defeating Azaruux to prove their growth."
8379,"In Agthia's Memory : Greetings, mortal!  Are you here to learn about the legacy of Agthia, Paragon of Courage?  I welcome you to walk the grounds of this ancient battleground to learn of the battle that occurred here, and the heroic Paragon who saved all of Bastion and the Shadowlands."
8380,Let the Hunt Begin : One step remains until we may begin the Penitent Hunt.  You and the other hunters will first siphon a small amount of anima from the souls. It will come with ease. The soul's time in the Grove of Terror causes trace anima to release.  This anima helps us venthyr in tracking the prey's fear.  I also ask that you do us the honor of signaling the hunt.  <The Fearstalker hands you an anima stake and a hollowed dredbat fang.>  Use these to complete the task.
8381,"It's a Dirty Job : This muck pool is all out of order. The anima shortage has taken its toll here for sure.   You see, the pools require filth and fiber to grow dredgers effectively. The problem is every time I try to treat the pool, the dang devourers are on my back!  Now the untreated muck is starting to coagulate into these elementals! Can you go and toss some of the filthy rubble into the pool to restore it?"
8382,"Where a Soul Belongs : This soul is no longer tethered to his world of Azeroth.  Kleia must perform her duty and bear him to Oribos to be judged by the Arbiter.  Take this vesper. When you are ready, it will call Ascended to ferry you back across the Veil to Oribos.  Go in service."
8383,Redemption for the Redeemer : <Energies of death and innervation struggle to free themselves from the blade and consume you to your very core.>  <The bonds of warding placed on this blade by Prince Renathal will not hold for long. It should be taken to Sinfall where more permanent arrangements have been made for this prisoner.>
8384,"Opening to Oribos : The prophecies told us that one day this dormant waystone would be needed by a  Maw Walker. That it would prove crucial to the fate of the Shadowlands.  It seems that day has come.  Draw upon the anima within you to activate this waystone. It will then be usable by all those who aid your cause.  If, as you say, Tal-Inara has created an anchor in Oribos, then that anchor will bring you back to us.  Go, <name>. Inform your allies that the Maw awaits... and that Korthia needs their help."
8385,"Army of One : Mevix will lead the attack, but you will finish it. There are no reinforcements, no cavalry.  Only you and your runeblade.  Show me the might you wield, outsider. Lay siege to the House of Constructs and bring them to ruin!"
8386,"On the Edge of a Revelation : Ah! Good. You answered the call.  As you can see, there are many aspirants who require our aid. Myself and the other disciples are hard pressed to deal with all of them. Some are in greater need than others.  Aspirants are most at risk when they are on the precipice of a revelation. It is a critical moment that we cannot allow to pass without intervention.  You must push them, one way or another.  Find the most vulnerable among your peers and do what you can to help them find the path forward."
8387,"Small Bites : The reviews are in, $p. Our menu is too Revendreth-centric!  All the best courts have exotic appetizers, small plates, and other specialties that guests can look forward to every time they come.  And for a court like ours, which boasts frequent guests from other realms, we simply must do better!  Do not worry, after tireless research, I have drafted a very particular list of ingredients for you to find me.  Bring them to me, and I will serve our guests eternity on a platter!"
8388,Pulling Hairs : The abominations are well organized and well supplied. We've not been able to gain any ground.  A little disorganization in their supplies and reinforcements might give us an edge.  I need you to work you way behind their lines and eliminate three abominations handling their supplies.
8389,"The Knowledge Keepers : Our vault was built to store countless secrets and artifacts. Even if we gain entrance, we can't be certain of what the Jailer is looking for.  Certain attendants are given the title of record keeper. They track items stored in the vault, and are known for their utmost discretion.  A number of keepers have been taken captive by the Mawsworn and are being tortured for information.  Save the record keepers, <name>. They can help us determine what the Banished One seeks."
8390,
8391,
8392,"Wrath of Odyn : The horn has been forged and the worthy have been selected.  Now, <name>, we have only to bind my chosen val'kyr to the horn and infuse them with my power that they may strike with my fury.  Come, bear witness."
8393,"Rule 6 Footnote: Don't Forget Anything : In the Maw, you must never forget to take everything with you.  Many things crawl within the Beastwarrens. The runes you brought back indicate that something of interest may have been left behind by the brokers who were taken there.  See if you can find it."
8394,
8395,"Enhancing the Hold : As thanks for your efforts in recovering the anima and souls we now have available, you may decide which of Elysian Hold's features we upgrade first.  Once active, it shall expand our capabilities to help not only Bastion, but all the Shadowlands.  Do not worry--as you continue to recover anima and willing souls we will activate them all in time. For now, a single upgrade must suffice."
8396,"Theater of Pain: Help Wanted : Oh, bother--the Lich champion has withdrawn from the contest.  Well, then... It appears we have an opening! Would anyone like to enter in her stead?  Perhaps to increase the odds for their house?  Anyone?  Oh, <name>! So kind of you to volunteer. No better way to get experience than to just jump right in unprepared!  Remember, we can't all be winners."
8397,
8398,"A Place To Call Home : You didn't end up on my list... so, I guess we're friends... for the moment.  Rathan took the soul you freed to Butchers Block near the Seat of the Primus.   Let us meet him there and plan our next step together."
8399,"Tough as Silk : We are the heart of silk production in Ardenweald, but we can't do our work!   Our grove has been completely taken over by spriggans and these strange shapeshifting... things.  The silkstriders who spin the silk are very delicate creatures. They need peace and calm, and a little music to keep them happy! But with all these monsters all over the place, they're super stressed out.  Please, can you get in there and eliminate these hooligans, and see if you can help get us up and running again?"
8400,"Compassion in Devotion : Our first order of business is to rededicate the Temple of Loyalty.  Pelagos has volunteered to stay here and help prepare for the ceremony. I requested that Nikolon bring his companions to meet us at Steward's Rest, to aid us in convincing some of the Forsworn of our new path.  Meet us there when you are able."
8401,"Monster Hunting : Make ready, <class>. We hunt a worldeater.  They are the largest of devourers, massive beings who can drain anima from an entire region within a matter of moments.   With Ardenweald suffering from the drought, a worldeater's presence could prove disastrous.  Still, we must not rush into battle without first understanding our prey. Tread the Elder Stand with me. Even creatures such as these leave spoor.  Knowing our quarry will be what allows us to slay it."
8402,"A Burden Worth Bearing : Mevix may be here for blood, but what I want is to spare my fallen kin from a terrible fate.  Most of my fellow kyrian were either slain in combat or shortly after arriving here. If their corpses were bound for this pit, then perhaps we can recover them before they are thrown into it.  Take the stewards with you and gather the bodies of my brethren. I will not allow them to be made into monsters."
8403,
8404,"At Your Service : I suppose I should commend you. You certainly exceeded my expectations.  Rathan can be sentimental, but he is right. This place can be our new home, and here we can construct new bodies for the souls you freed.  Inform Baroness Draka that she has earned the allegiance of Princess Emeni and the constructs of Butchers Block! We stand ready for whenever she has need of our strength."
8405,"Words of the Primus : Even in his absence, the wisdom of the Primus rings true. This message must have been put here to await one who proved worthy of hearing it.  <Draka peers at you.>  You came to Maldraxxus to learn why Bastion was invaded. Now you know that there is treachery in our ranks. And that there are noble souls here who will set things right.  Tell your allies in Oribos all you have witnessed. See that the warning of the Primus reaches the Eternal Ones.  It would be an honor to fight by your side again, <name>."
8406,"Land of Light : The Ember Ward is filled with outcasts from Revendreth society, whether they rebelled, crossed a noble, or simply looked at Denathrius wrong.  It is a Light-scorched land that drives venthyr mad, unless they manage to stay within the shadows.  If Alwin is there, it may be too late.  Let us visit Theotar at the Sanctuary of the Mad. I'm sure he will be pleased to see you."
8407,"Inquisitor Stelia's Sinstone : You never truly escape your past, Maw Walker.  Every venthyr once entered Revendreth as a soul, burdened by the immoralities of their mortal lives.  Like all souls, they carved their true names and most shameful transgressions into sinstones.  Knowledge that intimate can be a potent weapon, if wielded properly.  Locate the sinstones of the inquisitors aiding the Accuser so that you may kill them. Start with Stelia.  After they're dead, bring me the Accuser's sinstone. I will deal with her myself."
8408,"Introductions are in Order : Now yous is all set with yer new dredger, go ahead call on them and officially introduce yerself."
8409,"Souls for Sinfall : Baine suffers within Torghast, but at least we know that he yet lives.  Rushing to his rescue would prove disastrous without a plan of attack. I will see to preparing one.  In the meantime, I suggest you bring the souls you rescued back to Sinfall.   Denathrius's machinations have left the venthyr poorly provisioned, and Prince Renathal will require all the souls he can muster."
8410,"The Vessels of Metal : You have the bearing of one familiar with the art of smithing. But perhaps you have more to learn.  Vessels that hold the power of the runes can be crafted by a hand such as yours. But this I cannot teach you.  Hmm, there is a way. I will entrust you with a memory of my recipes for the vessels. Take it to a master of your craft and they will show you the way.  What's that? Do not worry. It is merely an echo of my memory. What you restored to me remains intact."
8411,"Taking Inventory : Dark forces be at work, <class>.   Ardenweald be where loa go ta be reborn after dey die on Azeroth. But some of da loa who be sleepin' in Ardenweald have gone missin'!  Gotta be someone powerful behind it, takin' dem from right under da Winter Queen...  Ol' Bwonsamdi can't be havin' loa vanishin' from Ardenweald. Dat could be me someday! No, no... we gonna put a stop to dis!  Go back ta Ardenweald and search for da missin' loa."
8412,Everliving Statuette : <Your familiarity with the Archivists' Codex makes it clear that this is one of the missing relics.  Archivist Roh-Suir has a spot for this statuette in the Reliquary of Remembrance.>
8413,"Path of Ascension: Alderyn and Myn'ir : Your soulbinds request your strategic mind in another trial.  Their sights this week are set on Alderyn and Myn'ir, that they may learn from the lessons their memories teach.  When you are able, report to Artemede to return to the Path of Ascension. Aid your soulbinds in defeating Alderyn and Myn'ir to prove their growth."
8414,"Securing the House : Your journey into the Maw was impressive, but it will take even more phenomenal feats to earn the loyalty of the Maldraxxi.  Increase your renown among our ranks, Maw Walker. The Maldraxxi are dedicated soldiers, but they will not follow just anyone into battle. Let your deeds prove your worth to them."
8415,"The Absent-Minded Artisan : Of all the foolhardy, misguided, exasperating...  <Guardian Kota snorts and stomps a hoof.>  But standing here does Sha'lor no good. We must find him and bring him back safely.  Come, meet me at the Autumnal Rise. We can survey the burrows below and see if there is any sign that he lives."
8416,"Baker's Dozen : Under this very tent, I've prepared delicacies that would make demigods cry tears of joy. I'm always in need of more baking supplies!  The brokers usually sell me eggs from parts near and far, but maybe this time you could help me out instead.  You familiar with gorm? Big insect-like creatures native to Ardenweald. Well, if you find me some eggs of theirs, I'll bake you up something nice in return!   Mama will even send Starchy to help you out."
8417,"The New Path : Today, a new paragon is anointed. And for the first time since the dawn of our realm, a temple is rededicated to represent our devotion to one another.  A new paragon, a new sigil, and a new path for all kyrian.  This ceremony shall be glorious indeed!"
8418,"The Seal of Contrition : Preparations for the Seal are complete.  Go, insert it into the Crest. Be delicate, yet firm! Move with purpose, but a steady hand."
8419,"The Prince's New Crown : The crown is ready. I will entrust you to deliver it to Renathal.  Make haste, <name>. This power will surely attract assailants if word gets out.  You may use the mirror to return. Know that I will be dispatching others to destroy it after your arrival.   Safe travels, Maw Walker."
8420,"RSVP: Stonehead : Hi, best bud!  Me no go party.   <Stonehead shakes his head vigorously.>  Got to stay for job!"
8421,
8422,"A Day in the Life : A Bearer's duty is to carry souls through the veil to Oribos, where they shall be judged and passed along to one of the realms of the Shadowlands.  This soul is ready to move on.  During this trial, you will experience his final moments before his death.  When you are prepared, you shall see how this soul passed."
8423,"Ascended : With success over their trials, our aspirants shall now start the next chapter of their afterlives.  They have proven themselves through eons of training and cleansing, and will now earn ascendance.  As each aspirant is called, I ask you and Pelagos to please assist by ushering them up. It is a tradition we have practiced for eons, reinforcing the bonds that we share."
8424,"Maw Walker : I believe now it is time for you to leave.  You are a Maw Walker, one who can activate the waystone between the Maw and the lands beyond. While your friends may not hold the same title, there is a way to send them through the gate.   Souls can be connected. In theory, if you let someone attune themselves to your soul while you activate the waystone, you both should be able to leave. Even fleeting connections may produce some result.  Go with your other two guests and see if my hypothesis is correct."
8425,"Hunting an Inquisitor : You may have noticed that inquisitors are protected by the Lord Chamberlain's magic. A potent consequence of wielding the Master's medallion.  But now that we have access to Inquisitor Traian's sinstone from the archives, we have the power needed to break through those defenses.  Locate the inquisitor, and order Temel to read out from his sinstone. Declaring the true name and sins of the inquisitor will shatter his defenses and make him vulnerable for a short window of time.  Be ready to strike."
8426,"What's My Motivation? : Now for our finale! A thrilling performance of the most recent trials on Azathoth!  <Featherlight checks his notes.>  Azeroth. Whatever. It features an artificial god, a powerful magic ice princess, an infamous queen, and an eldritch abomination of unspeakable terror! Who doesn't love a good drama with a dash of existential horror?  You're back to playing yourself, so just... do whatever heroes are supposed to do!"
8427,"Harvester of Wrath : We walk in the winged shadows of my brothers and sisters in arms, Stoneborn I have trained since they were first carved from stone.  This is an ancient rite. If we cross this bridge on foot, defeating any who would dare stop us, we may have an audience with the mother of the stoneborn. However, know that our safe return is not guaranteed, so try not to offend her.  I do not look forward to this."
8428,"Trading Favors: Spires of Ascension : The Kyrians of Bastion serve a unique role in the Shadowlands, ferrying mortal souls from their realms to ours. They are able to do so in great numbers, it would seem, in times of crisis or devastation.  We would like to know more about their travels to the realms beyond.   Surely one of them has brought something back from another land? They are, after all, so very interested in memories."
8429,Unknown Assailants : This must be the stone he found. I do not recognize the mark.You should bring this to the nearby droman. They are wise and retain much of the knowledge of the forests and the realms beyond. They will know what to do.
8430,"Settling Disputes : In my search to find kyrian that would fit our purposes here, I have landed on two in particular -- Pelodis and Nemea.  However, the two are involved in quite the rivalry, and struggle to focus their attention elsewhere. I propose that you aid them in settling their dispute so that they may focus on the task at hand.  I doubt they shall work together, however, so you will need to pick one to aid us."
8431,"The Temple of Purity : Greetings.  I am Kosmas, Disciple to the Temple of Purity.  The temple is a place of cleansing. Its sole purpose is to free aspirants of the burdens they carry with them from life. It is a place of quiet reflection even for those who have shed their burdens.  Of late, those who look to us for purification have grown numerous. My fellow disciples are stretched terribly thin. I have come to ask the aid of all able-minded aspirants.  Your help is needed. Please report to the Hand of Purity at once."
8432,"Torment Chamber: Jaina : <Bolvar studies the objects you acquired from the brokers in Torghast.>  I sense Lady Proudmoore's magic upon this debris. And these notes describe methods to contain her power.  <The Highlord focuses on the items, peering into the darkness.>  By the Light! They are tormenting her with white-hot fires. Though her will is strong, there is only so much any mortal can endure.  I will modify Ve'nari's Attuned Shard using the items you returned.  You must find her, $p. Before it is too late."
8433,"Abominable Stitching and Me : Constructs have formed the backbone of Maldraxxi armies in more wars than anyone can count. A well-constructed body can turn any soul into a potent frontline weapon.  There is an old abominable stitching table outside of the sanctum that could be used to build our own constructs. With the anima you've secured for our covenant, we should be able to restore it.  Report to Miggsie once the work has begun. You can find her at Butchers Block."
8434,"Night Fae Veteran : Ardenweald is safer than it has been in quite some time, thanks to you.  Your accomplishments have not gone unnoticed, even beyond the borders of Ardenweald.  Tales of your victories have echoed through the halls of Oribos. Zo'sorg, the Master of Conflict, has requested a meeting with you in the Enclave.  They have a keen interest in the art of war. I suggest you don't keep them waiting."
8435,Shoveltusk Soul : <The Shoveltusk Soul is protective and determined. The shape of the shoveltusk will be yours to call upon.>
8436,"Spirit-Gathering Labor : You are not like the others.The waters here carry deep power. Power most have forgotten. But the tirnenn forget very little.Power flows through the earth just as water flows with power. Flows can be trapped for a time, dripping. Drop by drop they drip into vessels.Search for the vessels beneath the falls. Collect the power."
8437,"Breaking Down Barriers : As I suspected, Stitchflesh's assistants are carrying on his work. Whatever they're building, we need to destroy it.  They've secured the chamber with a soul barrier and several bile spewers. We must find a way through!  Thales said he may have a suggestion."
8438,"A Proper Reception : Though the path you follow is not that of a traditional ascended, it is a kyrian path all the same.  To follow it is to bask in the footsteps of the innumerable lives before us, forever in service to a good far greater than we can achieve alone.  To join us amidst such strife is an accomplishment worthy of recognition. Our Archon has called all among us to join her in welcoming you to our ranks."
8439,The Queen's Request : Dire portents indeed.   I have used what little anima we possess to save our groves and the spirits they nurture. So many were lost... all as the Heart of the Forest grew ever weaker.  Keeping the Banished One bound within the Maw will require more anima than Ardenweald can spare.  <The Queen considers for a moment.>  Sire Denathrius is a master of anima extraction. Journey to Revendreth and inform him of our plight. I know he will lend us his aid.  Your allies in Oribos can open the way.
8440,"Dude, Where's My Necropolis? : Maintaining the portal between our sanctum and the Zerekriss is a difficult task. With enough resources, we could make it permanent and become the unstoppable force my baroness wishes us to be.  She has asked much of you, as have I. But this work will make your name a legend among the Maldraxxi, as my baroness's has become.  Help to empower us, and you will be empowered in turn."
8441,"Report to Adrestes : You have chosen well.  The Kyrian have long ferried souls across the veil into the Shadowlands, ensuring a steady supply of anima for all the realms.  Their sacred purpose must be kept strong. Speak with Polemarch Adrestes and begin your future with your covenant."
8442,"Herald Their Demise : Since the dawn of Revendreth, Temel has been charged with proclaiming the sins of souls for all to hear.  Every soul here, including venthyr, has been forced to endure his wrathful pronouncements on at least one occasion.  He will know how to wield Inquisitor Stelia's sinstone to break through her defenses.  Simply command him to do so after you locate the inquisitor, and eliminate her."
8443,"The Forest Has Eyes : That dream! With the teeth and the claws and the heart... heart-wrenching sacrifice?  <Moonberry chokes up for a moment then collects herself.>  Sorry! While we were in dreamland, possessed spies have snuck into Hibernal Hollow!   They must be hunted down and slain before they can report back on the grove's defenses.  Here, borrow a bit of my magic. Seek out the ones hidden in the shadows and smite them!"
8444,"The Mnemonic Locus : <Mikanikos examines the scroll you retrieved for him.>  Right, right.  Soul mirrors and Locus are tied together. If we restore anima to mirrors, it should repair the Locus back to full functionality. Thankfully, the cores you brought should be sufficient.  All I need to do is enable conduits. Simple!  Well? Go on. You know how to use these, yes?"
8445,"Nox Root : In order to perform the ritual, I will need some nox root from Darkreach.  It is a unique plant that only grows within soil that has been corrupted by Drust magic.  Darkreach lies to the west, not far from my den. What was once a peaceful, verdant grove is now filled with blight and ruin.  I will travel to the Heart of the Forest to prepare the ritual. Meet me there when you have gathered the nox root."
8446,"Misery Business : The Mawsworn have begun harvesting the misery of the souls flowing through Gorgoa, the river of souls.  Why? I do not know yet. But it behooves us to stop them.  Destroy the conduits that they deposit the misery into and bring me some samples of their work.   Perhaps with some research, I can discern their intentions."
8447,"Renny the Vulpin : <The small vulpin kit runs up to you with a cheerful bounce and an air of mischief.  You, it seems, are interesting. Interesting enough that this child of Lord Renard of the Court of Winter has decided to tag along with you.  What could possibly go wrong?>"
8448,"Hazardous Waste Collection : Ah, slimes: the dearest of friends and infinitely useful! They will help us craft our potion.  But it seems our tools have been scattered around, doused in toxic refuse. Margrave Stradama would be so disappointed at my lack of respect for lab safety!  Your slime can comb through the refuse, diluting the plague's harmful agents. Simply pull the cleaned equipment from the body of your slime!  Slimes... what would we do without them?"
8449,"Confronting Sin : Thanks to the raid launched against Castle Nathria, we have obtained an opportunity.  A soul, powerful and fused with dark purpose at the hands of the Master's experiments.   Given this soul is from Azeroth, the Accuser has asked for your assistance in untwining the corruption done to his sinstone.  the Accuser awaits you in the lower levels of Sinfall."
8450,"In Death We Are Truly Tested : Vyraz is the one who trapped me within the Maw. He has long been in league with the House of Rituals and the House of Constructs.  No doubt he intended to trap you within that hellish place as well.  It is time he be brought to justice for his treason. Stand with me, and we will face him as one."
8451,"Bet On Yourself : Dear Maw Walker... my friend... you're going to lose. Everyone knows you can't compete in the arena.   The entire Challenger's Promenade knows it, the brokers in Oribos know it, even Zo'umlo knows it.  I've brought in a special challenger just to prove the point. Face Ti'or in the Theater of Pain and prove us wrong... or prove us right.  We will be betting, so don't disappoint."
8452,"Medallion of Wrath : Maw Walker. I will march with my stoneborn into the depths of the Maw and rend the head off every nathrezim I find there.  However, Revendreth is still too strategic in this war to lose out of misplaced vanity.   Therefore, as Harvester of Wrath, the second of that title, I offer you my medallion for safe keeping and utilization while I wage this war.  Use it to empower the Harvesters so they can prevent Denathrius from simply returning and regaining control with a snap of his fingers."
8453,
8454,"The First Cleansing : This situation may feel familiar, <name>.  When you found Pelagos, he was undergoing a similar rite. As you saw, it can end in violence.  This will be the first time you are asked to draw out the burdens that held you to a mortal life. It may be a painful process. It is for many.  For you, this is the path you must walk to attain your goals. To earn the right to stand among us, to be heard. So we may carry your message to the Archon herself.  Center yourself. When you are prepared, we will begin."
8455,"The Heart of Ardenweald : I hid my sigil in the Heart of the Forest, to keep it safe from the forces of the Maw.  But the horn has called for aid.  You and your allies go, see what has prompted the call."
8456,"Fighting For Fungus : Behold, Marasmius!  This is his home, his heart. Every mushroom in Ardenweald, maybe even all of the Shadowlands, stems from here. And the masked fae want to take him for their own purposes. As chief mushroomancer, I cannot abide this.  Our foes may look mindless, but they are clever. They will have tracked my position by now.  I shall make my final stand here, and hope that Marasmius is strong enough to lend his aid.  Will you stand with me, <class>?"
8457,"Convene the Paragons : We have defeated the Forsworn at every turn. Saved those not too far gone. Routed them from our blessed Archon's temples. Now only one remains.  The Temple of Loyalty.  Lysonia has grown desperate in defeat. Abandoned all we strive to uphold by embracing the Maw. She has rallied her most fervent loyalists to the temple, knowing we will come for her.  We shall need the Paragons to finish this. Summon them."
8458,"The Aspirant's Crucible : I have given Kalisthene's words some thought.  If you are to learn our ways, we should proceed as if you were an aspirant yourself. The next step is to journey through the Aspirant's Crucible.  It is a place of reflection, training, and cleansing. For an aspirant, it is where they prepare for the long journey ahead. For you... I hope you will learn how you might help us in this time of crisis.  Word of your arrival has likely spread. We will not keep them waiting.  Take my steed, and go in service."
8459,Box of Torments : <The insidious music box hums an endlessly repeating set of dissonant chords.   Ve'nari may find it melodious.>
8460,"Continued Efforts: Mauler's Outlook : My Eyes tell me that the Mauler's Outlook is near the newly formed road from the Maw into Korthia. It would provide a strategic and tactical advantage.  Unfortunately, the area is overrun with shardhides.  If we can secure the area, it will provide us with a clear path to the west, as well as a point of observation to monitor the Jailer's forces."
8461,"Save Ol' Gertie : We have to find Ol' Gertie! She is the broodmother of the silkstriders, and is our most reliable producer. We cannot lose her.  But I cannot get to her and see if she is all right. She is usually at the top of the cliffs, at the highest point. Can you get up there, and make sure that she is safe?  If she is not... then may justice fall swift and hard on the perpetrator."
8462,"Can't Turn Our Backs : That's Sylvanas and her Mawsworn dealt with... for now.  But we need to hurry and make sure that the Queen and her sigil are safe!   The Winter Queen was just outside the Heart of the Forest, protecting the stolen wildseeds from the Maw."
8463,"De Other Side : Ay, dere <name>! Ya be just da <class> I've been lookin' for!  It be your ol' pal Bwonsamdi reachin' out ta ya from De Other Side! I be havin' a little problem over here wit' de boss...  Ya be lookin' mighty bored just standin' around here in Ardenweald. Why don't ya come to De Other Side and help out an ol' friend? Bwonsamdi promise he gonna make it worth ya while!  Ya might want ta bring a few more adventurers wit' ya... just ta be safe."
8464,"A Land of Strife : It is imperative that you identify the cause of the attack on Bastion.  We will require your aid to open the gateway. Once the focus is sufficiently powered, we will call upon the gate to Maldraxxus and direct it into position.  From there, the fate of this war must rest upon your shoulders."
8465,"By Any Other Name : Excellent work, my apprentice! Our laboratory is back in working order!  Now, there is one final ingredient we require to complete our potion for Margrave Stradama.  You will need to run along to the greenhouse. I've cultivated a sprig of dreadshade that should be ready to harvest.  I will prepare the other reagents while you're away. Be safe, apprentice!"
8466,"A Perilous Journey : Mograine has rallied the House of the Chosen to strike at Margrave Gharmal and his House of Constructs. They grow in strength with each passing day--this may be our only chance.  We will join them on the field of battle. We will have justice for the fallen at my temple, as well as Mograine's own fallen kin.  Rendezvous at Spider's Watch within Maldraxxus' northern reaches. We will move from there."
8467,"Regalia de Rigueur : Ah, if it isn't Kel'Thuzad's favorite acolyte? I simply cannot understand how a baron like him would surround himself with such... homely company.  When was the last time you even chanced at a looking glass? Those faded robes do your station no justice.  I would take it upon myself to update your drab apparel, if I weren't sufferring such a shortage on the house's preferred amethystine tint.  You could always fetch some yourself. The sorcerers usually have some stashed among their tomes and altars."
8468,"Better Off Dead : Our defense is tenuous at best, but the enemy is still hesitant to attack.  As long as they fear us, they won't be probing our defenses.   You must keep the pressure on the enemy.  Attack their positions all along our line."
8469,"Awaken the Dreamer : Much of the Queen's focus has centered on the Grove of Awakening, where rejuvenated spirits emerge from their wildseeds and return to their worlds.  Perhaps it is fitting you carry a wounded spirit with you.  <Lord Herne studies Ysera's wildseed for a moment before a slow grin spreads across his face.>  This one fights with all of her being. Even now she clings to existence.   Come, stranger, let us see what fate the Queen will decree for this one."
8470,"A Doorway Through the Veil : The Helm fragment connected us while you were in the Maw. As if through a darkened pane of glass, I saw glimpses of what you endured. The terrors you faced.  At least the heroes of Azeroth yet live. They must be saved.  By affixing the Helm here, you gave us a tether to Azeroth that served to bring a few of us across the veil. But you, and other heroes who join us, require a stronger connection.  Our acolytes can open portals back. No doubt these attendants will be particular about their placement."
8471,Supplies from The Wild Hunt : The Wild Hunt thanks you for your efforts in aiding Ardenweald.  Take these gifts as recognition for your aid. May they help you in whatever trials may come.
8472,"Into the Maw : I have not seen Tyrande since she departed for Icecrown... but I see her in my dreams. She stalks a nightmarish landscape, brimming with the might of the Night Warrior.  Such power is too much for any mortal to bear for long. I shudder to think of the toll it has taken on my minn'do.  Highlord Fordragon has told me of the Maw. If you truly have braved its horrors before, then I ask that you guide me through them as well.  We must find Tyrande and convince her to let go of the Night Warrior's rage."
8473,"Repair and Restore : You've already attuned several mirrors without incident. I do believe it's time you try your hand at repairing them instead.  It's quite easy once you've found the fragments, but there are a few things of note to keep in mind.   Repaired mirrors are fragile and unpredictable. They often break with a single use, and it's never a guarantee that using one will translocate you somewhere safe.   Here's a few shards to get you started.   Restore the mirror to working order and see where it leads."
8474,Ember Court: Mystery Mirrors : I support Prince Renathal's efforts and will certainly help the Ember Court!  Mystery mirrors will be dangerous but add real excitement to the party. I will need a lot of mirror fragments to complete enough of them in time.  You will also need to refresh my supply of Ashen Cores so I can get the glass sufficiently molten to work.
8475,The Traitor Unmasked : We must waste no time in warning the margrave of Kel'Thuzad's treachery. His reckless toying with forbidden powers could bring ruin to the house and beyond!  Let us put an end to this!
8476,Return More Lost Souls : Souls continue to pour into the Maw.   I see no reason you cannot pull even more souls from the abyss.  Return to the Maw and find me even more worthy of redemption.
8477,"A Common Peril : Each house in Maldraxxus has two barons. Before the fall of my first house--the House of Eyes--our margrave sent my fellow baroness to investigate suspicious behavior in the House of Rituals.  I have not heard from her since. Either she has found something... or has become another casualty of their treachery.   Her orders took her to the Decay in the east. If you can find the baroness, give her this summons.   We were not friends, she and I, but she is a formidable combatant. We could use her might."
8478,"Hunting Amid Houses : I have dreamed that Tyrande Whisperwind is crucial to the survival of Ardenweald.  The night fae have been searching for others like her who were once Night Warriors. We have recruited an ancient ally of Azeroth, Huln Highmountain, in order to look for them.  Elune's power is too much for any mortal to contain--even Tyrande. I do not know how much longer she can hold on.  Allow me to explain further, then you must hurry to meet Huln in Maldraxxus."
8479,"Ember Court: Atoning Rituals : If Prince Renathal wishes to impart knowledge of Revendreth's highest calling to his guests, we would be honored to demonstrate the rituals of atonement.  However, I must ask for your assistance preparing the necessary components quickly.  Capture nearby fugitive souls that hide from the Lord Chamberlain's corrupt venthyr. Bring them to our avowed ritualists across the halls. They will prepare the souls for our purpose.  Sinstone fragments will also help us identify the sins of these lost souls."
8480,You Cannot Run : Zelmany was integral in the fall of my Margrave.  Sin'Dane believes he is trying to gather forces loyal to Kel'Thuzad so they might help him in his next plot.  We should look for clues to his location and then slay him.
8481,"Home Improvement : I've been finkin' of a bit of ways we could improve the place, but since you brought in all of the anima and souls to do it, I fink you should be the one to decide which improvement we start on first.  Don't get overwhelmed. As you bring in more anima and find more willin' souls, we'll be able to bring more capabilities to the place. For now, a single upgrade will fit the bill."
8482,"The Wards of Bastion : Each temple of Bastion is protected by a ward here in Elysian Hold. As long as the wards hold, no malevolent force can launch an assault.  It is concerning that the Forsworn were able to attack Purity in such force...  Your orders are to examine the wards. As long as they hold, Bastion stands strong."
8483,"Path of Ascension: Artemede's Challenge : Are you prepared for a challenge, <name>?  Though most kyrian have their preferences, every kyrian must learn to fight with a multitude of weapons and equipment. This allows them to keep both their minds sharp and their muscles and movements honed.  Let us see how your soulbinds fare against the memory of Kalisthene while utilizing the Spiritforged Aegis."
8484,"Mirror Attunement: The Eternal Terrace : Work has been completed on a mirror that will allow travel between Sinfall and The Eternal Terrace. However, it has yet to be attuned.  The attunement process is quite simple. Just head to the mirror's location in the world, and pass through it once, returning to Sinfall. When you have done so, travel between the two mirrors should be seamless."
8485,"Mark of Knowledge : There is another matter for which I need your assistance. My researchers and interrogators have been tirelessly working on the second chamber. So far they don't have any leads.  I need you to speak to them and see if they've made any progress. Tell them, if they have nothing to show, then they will soon find themselves at the end of my sword.  Get me that mark, quartermaster!"
8486,"The Greater Good : The Forsworn are our former brothers and sisters in arms...our former kin. But we must see this through.  We will hit them from all sides. Fight well, but do not forget that Lysonia is our ultimate objective. If she does not fall, then she will recruit more to their cause in time.  Follow the path, <name>."
8487,"A Brokered Deal : Hey, <name>. I've found a lucrative business proposition that'll help me... us... greatly! See, Au'narim is willing to give us supplies if we can help him recover from a trade deal that went sideways.  Apparently, several of his cohorts never returned from a job. He needs us to follow their path and recover the item they failed to deliver. Simple, right?  To ensure we don't have any mishaps, I've taken the liberty of acquiring a few items that may be of help to us.  So, you in?"
8488,"Tending to the Tenders : The eggs are a problem, but so are the gorm that take care of them.The egg-tenders are the leaders of the hive when no matriarch is present. If left unchecked, they will simply produce more eggs and we will be right back where we started. Or worse, one of them could turn into a queen. They are simply too large and hostile for us to properly contain. I see no other recourse than to put them down."
8489,De-Infiltration : Mal'Ganis.  It has been many ages since I have said his name. And now I find we must hunt him down.  If he has the Medallion of Wrath then there is nowhere he can hide. We can use the other medallions we have recovered to locate him.  Join me in Sinfall and bring your dreadlord hunting party. I suspect we will have need of them.
8490,"The Brand Holds the Key : <Darion is unresponsive. The cage is locked, and doesn't appear easily broken.  Perhaps the holder of the key is this ""Brand"" he mentioned.>"
8491,Supplies from The Undying Army : Your efforts meet with the approval of The Undying Army.  These rewards are in recognition of those efforts. May they help you in the battles to come.
8492,"Assistance from Sinfall : In order to defeat the Forsworn, the Crest needs an artifact that embodies repentance, atoning for past mistakes and moving forward.  I have an artifact in mind.   Long ago, many souls from Revendreth arrived in Bastion. Purer souls than we have ever received from Revendreth.  They bore the mark of the Seal of Contrition, a focus that expedited their cleansing.  Go to Revendreth and find this seal so that we may harness its power."
8493,"End of the Dream : The time has come. The ritual will be complete when you have fully entered into the spirit's dreams.  It will be as if you are her, in every aspect.  She relives the moment of her death over and over again. It torments her. Something about how she ended... she had no control over her actions. She hurt the ones she loved.  Speak to me when you are ready to immerse yourself in her nightmare of the end."
8494,"The House of Plagues : The House of Plagues was the first to fall in this conflict. We believed its demise was the result of a careless accident. If only we had known the truth sooner...  But perhaps not all their knowledge was lost. Before you arrived, our scouts reported signs of movement near the wreckage of their necropolis.  If any survivors remain, we'd be wise to add them to our ranks. But approach with caution. The toxic fallout may have left them mad... or worse."
8495,
8496,
8497,You Can Only Die : The last name on my list is a lich named Fal'zinge.  Sin'Dane has been keeping a close eye on him to learn more of what Kel'Thuzad is planning next.   She wishes for Fal'zinge's execution to be brutal.   We will find him in the Exoramas in the House of Rituals.
8498,"Path of Ascension: Echthra : Your soulbinds request your strategic mind in another trial.  Their sights this week are set on Echthra, that they may learn from the lessons her memory teaches.  When you are able, report to Artemede to return to the Path of Ascension. Aid your soulbinds in defeating Echthra to prove their growth."
8499,"The Broken Spear : <The shattered remains of a sylvari spear litter the ground. You recognize the spear as belonging to Ara'lon.  This confirms that Ara'lon was here. Unfortunately, he is nowhere to be found.  Lord Herne will want to know of your discovery.>"
8500,"Do What We Cannot : Rumor has it that you've been to the Maw and back... and that you even made friends with a broker in there!   So many souls destined for Ardenweald are trapped in that dark realm. They need our help... and we need theirs! We can't cultivate the Heart of the Forest's magic without them.  I know this is a lot to ask... but you may be our only hope of rescuing them. Please, venture into the Maw and do what we cannot. Ardenweald's future depends on it!"
8501,"Someone Worth Saving : Are you familiar with Kael'thas Sunstrider? He was a powerful leader on your world for a time.  The immense anima of that lingering power attracted the Master's attention, to the eternal detriment of Kael'thas's soul.  <The Accuser's lip curls in disgust.>  Every soul deserves a chance at redemption, $p.  If you do not believe that, believe me when I say that this soul is immensely powerful and still at risk of self-destruction.  Release him so that we may walk his path of redemption together."
8502,"Defending the Vault : To reach the vault, we'll need to carve a path through the attacking Mawsworn.  The covenants are doing their best to drive off these monstrosities, but our allies can't hold out forever. The Mawsworn are intent on reaching the prize before you.  We could use your help fighting against the Jailer's forces, Maw Walker.  Purpose guide us all."
8503,"Ulfar's Guidance : There is one who may know how to dispel the curse from Gweyir.  In the mountains of Drustvar lives Ulfar, an ancient Thornspeaker who sided with the humans of Kul Tiras against his fellow Drust.  Journey to his den and ask for his wisdom. He may hold the answers you seek.  Lord Herne and I will tend to Gweyir once she arrives with Ara'lon."
8504,"Ember Court: Mushroom Surprise! : I had not realized the fame of my fungi had reached so far. I'd be delighted to provide a mushroom feast to the Ember Court!  Hmmm... I will need you to collect some rare specimens and will loan you my favorite foraging bag. It will help you find the very best fungi. It's never failed me.  Let's see, I need tiny lacy bells from Bastion and some of those Ardenweald fancy purple frills. From the very tops of our mushrooms here I will need the feather caps. You'll need to grapple your way up there."
8505,"How to Catch a Glimmerfly : Yes! Proper tools collected. Now to catch glimmerflies!  Anima drought more severe in northern pools. Many Starving Glimmerflies, most eager to drink from our animyllis blooms.  Place blooms, then while glimmerflies are drinking attach to filaments! Then return to me."
8506,"Break a Leg : The show is about to begin! You... that's what you're going to wear? Well, I suppose it works.  For your grand introduction, we will re-enact recent victories and events that took place on Azzinoth. Er, Azeroth. That's where you're from, right?  The Starlight Company has graciously volunteered to assist us in this production. We've recruited some special guests as well!   Don't worry about the script. This is your story, after all!  Just try not to get too much blood on stage. It's hard to clean."
8507,"Filling an Empty Throne : Maw Walker.  In my long absence, you have done much to bring order and strength back to the necrolord covenant. In recognition, I invite you to witness a ceremony.  Return with me to my seat of power in Maldraxxus. It is time I rewarded one who was most loyal to our cause."
8508,"Bone Tools : So the device we need to open this vault is stuck on a floating island, eh?  Not a problem.  I see plenty of sturdy creatures around here. Like I always say, no bone goes to waste!  Bring me a pile of their bones. I'll use them to craft hookshot points for us to use to grapple over there."
8509,"Path of Ascension: Athanos : Your soulbinds request your strategic mind in another trial.  Their sights this week are set on Athanos, that they may learn from the lessons his memory teaches.  When you are able, report to Artemede to return to the Path of Ascension. Aid your soulbinds in defeating Athanos to prove their growth."
8510,"A Test of Courage : I'm still new and haven't passed all of my Aspirant tests. But, I have an idea.  There is an artifact called Korinna's Allaying Crook. Korinna was a powerful Ascended who tamed the creatures of Bastion eons ago. Her staff has the power to prevent more creatures from succumbing to a savage, anima-starved state.  However, the artifact is protected and only one with great courage can retrieve it. I bet you could, <name>.  Go on ahead. The staff is in the reliquary to the north. I'll join you there shortly."
8511,"The Vessels of Jewels : You have the bearing of a lapidary. Though familiar with the art of jewelcraft, perhaps there is yet more to learn.  Vessels that hold the power of the runes can be crafted by a hand such as yours. But this I cannot teach you.  Hmm, there is a way. I will entrust you with a memory of my recipes for the vessels. Take it to a master of your craft and they will show you the way.  What's that? Do not worry. It is merely an echo of my memory. What you restored to me remains intact."
8512,
8513,"The Professionals : Smart move bringing in the specialists, $p.  Once you get into this week's Ember Court, be sure to let the specialists know what you want them to do.  Breakfist down in the dredger pools can smash or clean things to make the court more Messy or Clean for you.  Crooked Crick in the refreshments area can adjust Decadence.  Lady Ilinca in the embassy area can adjust Formality.  Cosmin the Illusionist on stage can adjust Excitement.  Wing Commander Vulpek at the front gates can adjust Danger."
8514,"Unbroken Bonds : The Drust will pay for this foul curse that they've unleashed upon us.  We have lost too many allies... too many friends to give up now. Even though we cannot save those who have fallen into possession, we can end their torment. I will instruct the hunt to put down all possessed they encounter.  Please deliver this report to the Winter Queen. She must be told what we have learned.  Thank you for your service, <name>. You are a true friend and guardian of Ardenweald."
8515,
8516,Alpaca Soul : <The Alpaca Soul is wary and alert. The shape of the alpaca will be yours to call upon.>
8517,"A Perfect Circle : I've come up with the perfect design to fit your needs--a crown capable of channeling the powers of the Harvesters.  I need one more tool to put it together, a mold. Circular objects difficult to get right.  Go up to my old storage. A perfect mold exists there. I'm sure of it.  Perhaps in one of my old trunks. Go rummage around for it, will you?"
8518,Supplies from The Ascended : The Ascended would like to thank you for your efforts in aiding Bastion.  Please accept a gift in recognition of your service to our cause and our people.
8519,A Light Touch : Need Firstborne's Light! You know?  Named after Archon! Always in water. Kofi's favorite!  Shine big light when grown. And go to shore! Easy to see!
8520,"The Wayward Baron : It has come to my attention that you seek to uncover a plot by the baron Kel'Thuzad.   That upstart has been a thorn in my side since he arrived at the House of Rituals. Not only did he pilfer my rightfully earned title, he has since shut me out of the house's dealings.  I have yet to find evidence that would mar Sin'dane's adoration for her new baron, and thus I offer an arrangement. I grant you access to the House of Rituals, and in return you help me bring down Kel'Thuzad.  Do we have an accord?"
8521,"Doing the Dew : The Thistledrop is magnificent creature. The roots go deep into the earth where they drink of waters most ancient. With these waters they collect the very essence of the land into a drop of dew that enables our artisans to craft powerful armaments.  Help us gather the dew and you will be well rewarded.  Hurry, before it evaporates!"
8522,"The Vesper Rings : Loyalty shall no longer be a demanded tenet of the Path, but rather a virtue that is earned. A choice.  We must show devotion to those who struggle, whether they are recently arrived souls or peers who need our aid.  It will take all the anima at hand to rededicate this temple. And in so doing, to ring in a new age for the kyrian.  I fear the Mawsworn may attempt to thwart our plans. Protect me during this ritual, <name>. We must see this through."
8523,Servant of N'Zoth : <class>...  I have watched you... I have felt your bloodlust.   But you serve false prophets... the Alliance is an illusion... I am a god!  Prove to me you are worthy of my gift... kill those who are to betray you...  Kill... the Alliance!
8524,"The Old Ways : You there! Might I ask your help?  I must confess, with the lack of new souls arriving, our supplies have dwindled. We lack the means to clothe arrivals in proper kyrian attire.  Before the forging of the centurions, aspirants trained against the native wildlife. Perhaps there is another way these beasts can prove useful.  If you collect materials from the cloudstriders and larions nearby, we can use them to ensure our new arrivals look the part.  Oh, and some thread from Mirene, if you would!"
8525,"Keepers of Korthia : We've barely held out against the Jailer's forces. Now that you're here, we can finally make some progress.  I know your priority is to enter the vault, but our record keepers must also be recovered.   They are the authorities about everything kept in the vault. We can't let the Jailer learn what they know."
8526,Functioning Anima Core : <The incomprehensible core whirs with a pleasant hum.   Surely someone would have a use for this? >
8527,"Rezan, Loa of Kings : Rezan be a powerful loa, one of great importance ta da Zandalari.  We need ta rescue him... but dis creature be projectin' a barrier of death. Notin' be gettin' in.  Unless... I be usin' me own anima ta shield ya from its magic.  Ya gotta act fast and kill da monster dat be drainin' Rezan. Me anima not gonna last forever.  Say da word when ya ready ta go."
8528,Obelisk of Dark Tidings : <Your familiarity with the Archivists' Codex makes it clear that this is one of the missing relics.  Archivist Roh-Suir has a spot for this obelisk in the Reliquary of Remembrance.>
8529,"A Friendly Rivalry : Ah, a fresh soul! Your perspective may prove useful to us.  Nemea and I have opposing viewpoints. She lauds her larion, creatures native to Bastion whom she raises and trains as her companions.  However, I find that phalynx are the superior beings. They are efficient, obedient, and easy to work with.  Please, come learn both of our ways. Perhaps you can decide which of our ways of life is superior."
8530,
8531,Supplies from Death's Advance : Your work toward stopping the Jailer's advances has not gone unnoticed. If it is power you seek to continue your efforts I believe I can be of some assistance.
8532,Ve'rayn's Head : <Ve'rayn has been hunting Ve'nari for some time. Ve'nari would be very interested in seeing proof that she has been dealt with permanently.>
8533,Legend of the Animaswell : <This appears to be an incomplete set of notes detailing one archivist's search for a mythical font of anima hidden somewhere deep in Korthia.  Koros in Elysian Hold would be able to help you put together a team to search for it.>
8534,"Advancing Our Efforts : A venthyr's primary responsibility is ensuring that souls are unburdened of their pride, but they must see to other matters as well.   We must act beyond the bounds of Revendreth to ensure that the souls of the Shadowlands keep to their fate.  Allow me to demonstrate with a simple task for your companion here. This will be the first of many strikes."
8535,"Drink to the Dead : The Forsworn are ravaging the temples of Bastion, and the aspirants are leaving behind their supplies as they flee.  All those wonderful bottles of nectar falling into the hands of the Forsworn? I think not!   There's no way we can save all of the aspirants, but we can keep the Forsworn from taking those supplies. Besides... we could all use something to drink around here."
8536,Kivarr's Den : Kivarr... I have not heard that name in many an age.  She used to make her home near Eventide Grove to the south. Ara'lon knows the area well. I suggest you take him with you.  I fear that the situation with Gweyir weighs heavily upon him. Perhaps joining you on the hunt will do him some good.
8537,Crane Soul : <The Crane Soul dances with grace. The shape of the crane will be yours to call upon.>
8538,"Lead the Way : We must move now. That won't be the last assassin we face.  I can provide some cover of darkness, but mind that the spell is not infallible.  Enough talking. The Curator needs us and my mirror shard to get to her as soon as possible."
8539,"Mending a Broken Hart : We have all the reagents for the counter-curse!  Hurry up and cast it before Qadarin's soul is lost, and Thiernax refuses to help you, and Tyrande is doomed to die horribly in the Maw, and everyone is sad!  But no pressure."
8540,Kyrian Assault : The Jailer's forces  have been caught off guard by our attack. We shall overrun Perdition Hold and defeat his champions at the Altar of Domination!  Your help is needed Maw Walker. Assist our forces on the battlefield!
8541,"No Wisp Left Behind : More of the Kaldorei souls still languish in the Maw.  I ask you once again, Maw Walker, to find them.  Help correct this wrong."
8542,"Mirror Attunement: Pridefall Hamlet : Work has been completed on a mirror that will allow travel between Sinfall and Pridefall Hamlet. However, it has yet to be attuned.  The attunement process is quite simple. Just head to the mirror's location in the world, and pass through it once, returning to Sinfall. When you have done so, travel between the two mirrors should be seamless."
8543,"Calling in All Favors : $p, the time has come.  We cannot allow Kel'Thuzad to wield the Ritualists' sorcery as a weapon. He must be destroyed.  Rally our forces. We march on the House of Rituals!"
8544,"Success Without Soul : The larions seem to truly enjoy your company, Andira most of all.  I hope you've come to understand and appreciate the nuance of working with a beast with free will.  Now you must spend time with Pelodis, down the hill. His phalynx may be effective, but working with them only brings hollow satisfaction.  I am sure working with the phalynx will only strengthen your appreciation of larions."
8545,
8546,"We Need a Healer - You! : There are too many wounded on the battlefield!   Not everyone can 'bash it and make better.' We need more healers.  You, take my device and get our wounded back on their feet!"
8547,"A Reflection of Truth : I sent the Fearstalker far from here with that trap--buying us some time.  On the other side of this mirror lies the depths of Castle Nathria, the fortress of Denathrius himself. There, a meeting between Denathrius and one of his lackeys is about to take place.  Join me through the mirror, <name>. You shall see the truth of this ""drought"" first hand."
8548,"Skin in the Game : This task is probably above your capabilities, but listen anyway.  As a construct I was feared throughout the Shadowlands. The magnificent skin of my construct was impervious to mortal weapons, it was a work of art that took years to perfect.  When I was removed from my construct, it was Faldo Iscar who took great delight in stealing that skin. He keeps it on himself as a souvenir.  Kill Faldo Iscar, and get my skin back!"
8549,"Reconnaissance... for my, uh, Recovery : It appears I am at your mercy once more, $p.  Far be it from me to tell you the best way to absolve my sins as the Accuser insists we do.  However...  In that note, the Tithelord arranged a meeting with his contact in Darkhaven. Do you know where that is?  If you do, we could investigate, gather more information, and present that information to the Accuser and Prince Renathal.  I imagine that would be quite useful to them.  And a very selfless act of assistance on my part, do you not agree?"
8550,"Rebuild Our Trust : Well <name>, it seems you are serious about earning your way back into our good graces.  It seems you are serious about this penance. This task should prove your willingness to rejoin our ranks."
8551,"A Conduit for Good : While the gifts your bond shall bring you are substantial, you may also empower yourself further through the use of conduits.  Conduits act to channel the energy of your soulbind into your form more directly, increasing your potential in a myriad of ways.  Use the ones I have given you as a test of this power, but fear not--you will find others as you aid the Shadowlands."
8552,"Words of Warding : The towering citadel in the distance is protected by perilous walls, but its greatest dangers cannot be seen with mortal eyes.  The Mawsworn have placed invisible runes of warding throughout Perdition Hold. These traps have caught many intruders unaware.  The runes can be dispelled, but only if you can see them. I believe one of their soulcloaks should give you the sight you require.  Good luck."
8553,"Path of Ascension: Thran'tiok : Your soulbinds request your strategic mind in another trial.  Their sights this week are set on Thran'tiok, that they may learn from the lessons her memory teaches.  When you are able, report to Artemede to return to the Path of Ascension. Aid your soulbinds in defeating Thran'tiok to prove their growth."
8554,"An Invitation to Treachery : While the missive made it clear that Andrei is displeased with my position, nothing in the letter identifies his co-conspirator.   All we really know is that they are trying to gain access to my soiree this evening so they can carry out their plans. Let's make it easy for them, shall we?   Head into the Redelav District and deliver an invite to the prominent houses. This way, we'll be sure the traitors show up."
8555,"Mirror Attunement: Dominance Keep : Work has been completed on a mirror that will allow travel between Sinfall and Dominance Keep. However, it has yet to be attuned.  The attunement process is quite simple. Just head to the mirror's location in the world, and pass through it once, returning to Sinfall. When you have done so, travel between the two mirrors should be seamless."
8556,"The Blue Seed : I remember seeing a blue seed with red leaves nearby, but it was in a cave behind a wall of brambles. I didn't think of it at the time, but maybe you could use the red seeds to get us in?  I wish I didn't mix up the instructions or we wouldn't be in this mess. But maybe it's all going to work out anyway. Let's go!"
8557,"Path of Ascension: Craven Corinth : Your soulbinds request your strategic mind in another trial.  Their sights this week are set on Craven Corinth, that they may learn from the lessons his memory teaches.  When you are able, report to Artemede to return to the Path of Ascension. Aid your soulbinds in defeating Craven Corinth to prove their growth."
8558,Hope Ascending : There is one final thing we must do.  Meet us atop the peak of Hope's Ascent.
8559,"I Intend to Live Forever : Please, <name>. I am not finished.  There is one more memory that I must see. One more that must be faced.  It... it will not be easy. I will need support from all of you.  But it must be done."
8560,Blueprint: Charm of Fortitude : <You have discovered plans for a charm that seems to fortify your soulbinds in the Path of Ascension.  Dactylis should be able to help you with crafting this charm.>
8561,"Remnants of Hope : I studied the key you brought back from Torghast, <name>.  It confirms that Jaina Proudmoore is still being held somewhere in the tower. However we do not know precisely where.  Countless souls are captive inside that wretched place. A few may be intact, but many are shattered and broken.  Take pity upon the remnants and free those you can. Perhaps they will be able to aid our search."
8562,"A Monument to Vengeance : <Corpses of Ebon Blade knights litter the Crucible of the Damned, displaying the aftermath of your first foray into this desolate place.  Their sacrifice should not be forgotten.>"
8563,
8564,"Side Effects : Scrapper Minoire's use of enhancers creates unpredictable betting implications. It is quite unhealthy... for our profits!  For a nominal fee, Au'larrynar can provide you with a ""special"" enhancer that Minoire will not be able to resist: a potion that turns the one who imbibes it into the ultimate combatant... and teaches them a lesson in restraint, as well.  I cannot wait to see Minoire's next match in the arena!"
8565,"Hero's Rest : In light of the new arrivals to Bastion, Kalisthene has enabled the anima gateways to Hero's Rest once more!  Those wishing to partake of breathtaking views, unparalleled steward service, and all manner of training and repair facilities should venture to this most remarkable of locations at their earliest convenience.  Simply follow the path north and bear to the right at the crossroads.  Kalisthene will personally greet all new arrivals for this most joyous of occasions!"
8566,Gharmal's Tower : Gharmal collected anything they believed to be an item of power.  We'll need to search the tower. There is almost certainly something here of value to us.
8567,"Bring Out Your Tithe : Unfortunately the Lord Chamberlain's gift isn't sufficient to cover the entire tithe we're expected to provide the Tithelord, but it will make a good start.  The loss of the tithe convoy is a terrible blow to our village. Our little community is already suffering greatly from the drought and the need to meet the Tithelord's demands. Still we must all do our part.  We have little time to accomplish this task. Can you help? Get the tithe from villagers and scour the area for every forgotten drop."
8568,Battleground Observers : Zo'sorg and the other brokers of Cartel Zo can be found just down the hall.  They will certainly be eager to hear that large-scale battles are included in the Purpose.
8569,"Wake Up, Get Up, Get Out There : They need your help!Not all of the faeries have been turned yet. Some remain prisoner, but they have these masks on their faces....You've got to help them! I'm not strong enough to pry off the masks, but you could! You could stop the guards from getting us too!"
8570,Distorted by the Maw : Lysonia's forces are rerouting the anima collectors to spew Maw energy across the temple. They hamper our forces while strengthening their own.  The collectors have been tainted. Take Compassion and destroy them to halt Lysonia's boon.
8571,"Cage Free Spores : I will need your assistance with the collection of one other reagent for your master. These spore clusters he requests--while normally a trivial matter--will require a bit of work.  You see, as the veilwing rampaged throughout the Reagentry, it toppled and broke several nearby cages hosting the blightrays from which we harvest the clusters.  You will have to collect them through more... conventional means.   The clusters are fragile, however, so try not to damage them while subduing the creatures."
8572,"Grinder : It's tough keeping these hands of mine razor sharp. With all the hacking and cleaving, they can grow dull so quickly! What's a girl to do?  The House of the Chosen makes some very fine quality sharpening stones. I doubt they will just hand them over, but I'm sure my blades can persuade them otherwise.  How about we pay them a visit and see how many stones they can spare?"
8573,"Keeper of Great Renown : As you grow in renown across the Shadowlands, the Heart of the Forest shall grow with you.   Seek out Laurel, our Keeper of Renown. She will acquaint you with the magic that we bestow upon our huntsmen and huntresses."
8574,Fight and Flight : Alexandros and Emeni will lead the Chosen assault on the western gate.   You and Xandria will direct your forces at the eastern gate. Secure the area and eliminate any resistance.   Once both flanks are secured we can attack Gharmal directly.
8575,"What's In a Memory? : It may be possible to extract memories from fragment, but I worry they will not be useful. This is not whole kyrian, but a tiny piece! A weird, broken piece. It cannot even speak!  We will apply extractor and see what comes out. Extractor might explode. It might not. For this? Worth the risk, I think.  Do not know what will emerge. Could be memories. Could be nothing. Could be something else. May try to fight you! Stay on your guard, yes? Collect all that look Forsworn.  Speak when ready."
8576,
8577,Faith Through the Darkness : This drought is... so much larger than I imagined.  Why did nobody tell us?  The burden of this knowledge weighs heavy... do we bear souls to their eternal torture?  We must return home.
8578,"Path of Ascension: Kalisthene : Your soulbinds request your strategic mind in another trial.  Their sights this week are set on Kalisthene, that they may learn from the lessons her memory teaches.  When you are able, report to Artemede to return to the Path of Ascension. Aid your soulbinds in defeating Kalisthene to prove their growth."
8579,
8580,"A Desperate Solution : <A well-made, if well-worn, journal catches your eye.Thumbing through the pages, it is clear that this journal once belonged to someone prominent from this group of night fae. The last few pages are torn out of the book.Perhaps if the rest of the pages were located then Partik could help decipher what happened here.>"
8581,"Conduits, What Are They For? : While the benefits of soulbinding are substantial, you may strengthen them further through the use of conduits.  Conduits act to channel the anima of our bond in a myriad of ways, vastly increasing both of our potential.  Let us test out the ones I have given you. Fear not--many others like it can be found throughout the Shadowlands."
8582,"Resource Drain : Usually repairs easy. Anima everywhere!  Except drought means we can't just pull it from air. Other sources needed!  Take this. Drain anima from cloudstriders. Not ideal, but desperate times."
8583,"Refining Ego : I will locate Phaestus. In the meantime, task for you!  The Forsworn use my forge to make their centurion army. Their vile intentions warp the metals we use!  Destroy their centurions, take their parts. Smelt them down in the forge to purify the metals, then return to me.  I need much metal for my plan."
8584,"...Why Me? : <The dense, chunky liquid inside the vessel emits a horrendous odor.  The initials O.K. are etched into the side. It seems someone stole Overseer Kalvaros' canteen.>"
8585,"A Time for Courage : I know not what awaits us across the chasm, outsider. By the Archon's grace I hope that my Paragon yet lives, but I fear the worst.  We will face this great unknown together, as we have the rest of Maldraxxus's horrors. To be kyrian is to follow the path, no matter how dire the circumstances.  Whatever happens, know that you have earned my undying respect this day."
8586,"Practical Applications : Greetings, Maw Walker.  I am pleased to announce that we have accumulated the relevant research necessary to set up a Field Anima Diverter.  Please find a suitable location for it in the Reliquary, preferably where it will not be impacted by interference from other anima-charged relics."
8587,"He Was My Student : Uther's memories of this Prince Arthas haunt him deeply. He is the reason Uther's soul was fragmented, why Devos fell the way she did.  The pain in these memories is palpable.  We have to dig deeper. Uther must face the source of this darkness.  Once again, you need to enter his past to protect his future."
8588,
8589,"A Sacrifice of Anima : The last thing we need for this counter-curse is some attuned anima.  Of course, we don't have much to spare. That means this is more of a sacrifice than it normally would be.  But you know what? The spriggans made this mess, so they should help clean it up. Some really nasty ones have been causing mischief in Tirna Scithe. They should have the anima we need.  Thiernax looks like he could use some nice, vengeful, therapeutic spriggan stomping. I'll have him meet you there."
8590,"Pardon Our Dust : Ah yes, the Greeter.  It seems this Mnemis unit has been deactivated. Anima has been so scarce of late, and with no new souls entering our gates... I suppose it was a prudent measure. Anima is our most precious resource, after all.  There are some centurions nearby. A portion of their Anima could serve our needs.  Ah! One of our most helpful stewards is here to lend her aid. She will guide you in the collection effort.  Return when you have sufficient Anima and we will power the Greeter once more."
8591,Trinkle Trinkle Little Twerp : <On the note are the scribblings for a plan to steal silkstrider larvae and cook them.  It is signed by someone named Trinkle.>
8592,"Tracker Tracking : We will require the aid of an expert tracker if we are to find the other Night Warriors.  The Wild Hunt possesses legendary skills in such matters. No quarry can elude them.  Speak with Lord Herne. With one of his hunters at your side, your search will surely be successful."
8593,"The Door to the Unknown : You empowered the final rune? Then we might yet turn the tide of battle!  Open the door, <name>! We'll hold the enemy back as long as we can!"
8594,"Ember Court Ambassador : Expanding your influence is quite simple.  Find someone. Ask them what they want. Give it to them.  Congratulations. You now have influence with them.  If we wish to engage the other realms and win them over to our side, we must do the same on a larger scale.  So go to the other realms. Give them what they want. Expand our influence."
8595,"Containing the Night : It is fortunate you are here, <name>.  Thiernax believes he may know how to save Tyrande from the fate he himself suffered as the Night Warrior.  Let us hear what he has to say."
8596,"Reclaimable Anima : Mikanikos has explained much about Forsworn centurions to me, <name>.  I cannot say that I understood all of it, but it seems he has not yet found a reliable way to return them to their proper operating standards.  Their anima can still be useful, though!  Adrestes has focused on how to rededicate the temple, but not on his own safety. I worry the process will drain much of his anima.  If you can reclaim cores from the Forsworn centurions, we can use them as anima stores for Adrestes."
8597,"RSVP: Sika : Hello, <name>! Sika like to help. So much to do.  Would go to Ember Court, but too many things only Sika can do. Very sorry."
8598,Revenge Delayed : <The Korthian protector is gravely wounded and struggles to speak.>  Devourers... swarmed the sanctuary. Too few of us...  My duty... incomplete.  The Purpose... I...  <The protector's voice fades.>
8599,
8600,"Where is Prince Renathal? : This is not victory, $p. If Prince Renathal does not return, we've merely delayed defeat.  The Prince was last seen during an assault on the Master's keep alongside Duke Theotar.  We don't know the Prince's fate, but we've learned that Duke Theotar was banished to the Ember Ward.  The Ember Ward is a land of madness and torture. Blighted by the Light, the Master sends his most hated enemies there to suffer unending agony.  Enter the Ember Ward, find Theotar, and discover the Prince's fate."
8601,
8602,"The Better Part of Valor : We now have no choice but to make a strategic retreat. Kel'Thuzad is far too fortified within the necropolis, and if Ninadar is his ally, then the House of Rituals is firmly in his grasp.  It will take nothing short of an army to save the margrave now."
8603,"How to Wear Seven Medallions : One venthyr cannot wear seven medallions and command the power they bestow, nor command respect from anyone looking at them.What I propose is the crafting of an artifact that can contain the power of the medallions. Focusing that power to one wielder.Unfortunately, Revendreth lacks the craftsmanship needed to channel such powers. Not without turning the wearer into a puppet of Denathrius.No, for this, we must employ the aid of a realm that specializes in service.Draven has the details."
8604,"A Calling in Ardenweald : Ardenweald is fractured, its roots strangled. Before we can begin to regrow our glades, we must unearth the evils that have festered here.  We call to you, today, to defend our forests. Take the weald paths through our lands, aiding our allies and defeating our enemies. With these actions, we will renew our forces, and rebuild our anima. In time, hope will blossom.  Our trust is in you, our newest seedling."
8605,"Archivist Fane : Well, our disguises are superfluous now. We will not be welcome after disrupting their depraved ritual.  Despite what we've observed here, some steadfast venthyr do still remain within these halls. Those who have not forsaken our vocation, and carry on with our calling.  Archivist Fane is one such as these. Aid his endeavors however you can. We will need his insight to loosen the Lord Chamberlain's grip over these halls.  I must tend to Gresit. He has much to learn."
8606,"A Sure Bet : You've made a name for yourself and earned the respect of everyone here, including Au'narim.  You are ready, $p!  Anzio is expecting us at the entrance to the Theater of Pain. You're going to be a champion!"
8607,"Dredging up a Name : Oi, why aren't you addressing me by my proper name? Wait, I don't remember my name, proper or other. Does this mean I have amnesias? Oh no, I don't have a name, please, help!"
8608,"How to Get a Head : An eager rookie who wants to be champion of the arena? People love a story like yours, but the first step is to get you noticed.   Here's the plan. Marcel Mullby needs bloodtusk skulls, but it takes a real fighter to get those!  You go kill some bloodtusks, use my knife to collect their heads, and deliver them to Mullby. That should get you recognition."
8609,"From the Mouths of Madness : I cannot express my gratitude enough for your help, champion.   We mustn't linger, however. The Jailer's forces will soon be alerted to the disturbance here.  Let us leave this place at once!"
8610,"Dire Learning : Necromancers and liches often use powerful tomes to assist in their rituals. Now that the House of Rituals has expanded their reach, the tomes can be found anywhere where their members are active.  Find these books and destroy them. It won't end their vile experiments but it should at least delay them."
8611,"Flight Test : I fix these to my arms... then they become wings, yes?  Then I jump off cliff. And fly!  You watch?"
8612,
8613,
8614,"Weapon in Hand : A moment, <name>.  I threw my axe Dra'gora at Helya during our first encounter in the Maw, and I haven't seen it since. If this is truly where she commands her forces, then perhaps it's held here.  I crafted that weapon in Nagrand, and it reminds me of many good days spent beside my family there. I want to feel its weight in my hands once again."
8615,"Kyrian Veteran : Bastion is healing thanks to you, <name>. The path is clear.  Your accomplishments have not gone unnoticed, even beyond the borders of Bastion.  Tales of your victories have echoed through the halls of Oribos. Zo'sorg, the Master of Conflict, has requested a meeting with you in the Enclave.  They have a keen interest in the art of war. I suggest you don't keep them waiting."
8616,
8617,"The Fearstalker : The trap has been set and the Fearstalker has walked right in.  Just as I expected, her pride has blinded her to the obvious. Have that vial I gave you earlier ready. It may prove useful in the fight ahead.  When you are ready, we can spring the trap."
8618,"Refuge of Revendreth : Sinfall is more than a ruin. It was once a place of dark magic and experimentation.  When the Light retaliated and scorched the Ember Ward, the walls of this place stood. It is fortified, supplied, and filled with secrets. A perfect staging ground for our upcoming conflict.  But first, take me to meet these allies who led you to Vorpalia. We must take stock of what resources we have to work with."
8619,Guaranteed Delivery : <The broker appears to be from Cartel Ve. Perhaps they were once an associate of Ve'nari.  Clutched in their hand is a list of items and a containment orb.  Finishing this broker's task and sending the items back to Ve'nari will surely earn you some compensation.>
8620,Rescued from Torment : The Mawsworn are not only killing those they find in the Seeker's Quorum. They are interrogating the survivors.  We should help save those we can. It's possible one of them might have seen the Fatescribe.
8621,"Observing the Chase : In our observations of your kind's conflict, we have noticed a high rate of escape among the prey.  This is unadvantageous to our observation efforts.  The Observer has acquired a tool we believe will improve your ability to force conflict.  Before I give it to you, we ask that you prove your willingness to participate in such conflicts, so that we know we will receive a worthy return on this investment."
8622,"Flutterback : Baine suffers within Torghast, but at least we know that he yet lives.  Rushing to his rescue would prove disastrous without a plan of attack. I will see to preparing one.  In the meantime, I suggest you bring the souls you rescued back to Ardenweald.  They deserve respite after their harrowing ordeal in the Maw, and they will surely prove vital to the Night Fae's efforts."
8623,Dreamweaver : Troubled winds sweep across Tirna Vaal. The boughs tremble in concern over the Queen's arrival. All must be as it should be.  Dreamweaver's wings droop with the weight of worry. Chaos swirls around the wildseeds under his care.  Calm the churning waters of the grove. Bring harmony to discord and let Dreamweaver flutter once more.
8624,"Glorious Pursuits : Perhaps Draka has forgotten her loyalties, but I will fulfill my mission.  My enemy--the lich Mor'Bitan--hides within the House of Rituals. For some reason, his underlings skulk in this marsh.  We have not learned why they are here, but my devoted have spotted Mor'Bitan's second-in-command, Mephiles the Loyal. He will have our answers.  Collect him for me. Once you capture him, slay his kin. Weaken his resolve.  I will prime my base for his interrogation."
8625,"Enough Vengeance For One Day : After the Sunwell's destruction and the near extermination of my people, I vowed to claim vengeance upon Arthas and Kel'Thuzad. But I needed power to see that happen, and to seize that power I...  <Kael'thas grows quiet.>  I... am ready to return to Sinfall. I must recover my strength for what lies ahead.  As the Accuser is so fond of reminding me, I have... much to ponder.  Let us inform our allies of the enemy we have revealed."
8626,"Double Tap : The House of Rituals occupies the southern half of the temple. Unlike the constructs, their key advantage in battle is their endless army of risen fighters.  Thankfully, the Archonic Resonator we recovered will take care of it.  As we carve our way through their forces, blast their corpses with the resonator. Its energy will sunder their souls, preventing them from being raised to fight again."
8627,"Seek Your Mark : I see why Draka sent you in her stead--you accomplish what she could not.  We have all the pieces. Now, we must simply put them together.  The steps to the ritual are simple: place our fractured crystals in formation around the obelisk.  Then comes the sigil--*our* sigil. Use the maldracite powder to draw a binding glyph at the obelisk's base.  When you are through, return to me."
8628,"Winter Be Comin' : Da boss be puttin' together an army of terrible loa. Hakkar and Dambala may only be da beginnin'. How da boss get so strong? I not be seein' him use power like dis before...  Da Winter Queen not be fond of ol' Bwonsamdi, but we gonna need her help to stop Mueh'zala.  Ya be friendly wit' da Queen, no? If she be willin' to rally her forces, we might be able to stop Mueh'zala before it be too late.  Head to da Heart of da Forest and speak wit' da Queen. She be our only hope now."
8629,"An Earned Bond : There is one more thing you should do, Maw Walker.  In rebuilding the Crest of Ascension you have earned more than just the trust of your fellow kyrian. It would seem our Forgelite Prime, Mikanikos, has rather enjoyed your time together and would like to soulbind with you.  Given his predilection towards, well, himself, I am as surprised as you are. You must have truly impressed him."
8630,"Spider's Lair : When our house fell in ruins, Manipulator Zalisar seized the opportunity to reform the house under his leadership. He found few followers and soon vanished into the ruins nearby.   He has begun to manipulate the spiders and train them to be his soldiers. Spiders under his control have begun to prey upon our forces. We need to deal with this threat before it grows any worse.  I need you eliminate Manipulator Zalisar and his spider forces."
8631,"Hopeful News : The terms of our bargain have been met. You may depart with the souls you acquired.  Perhaps the fate of this ""Baine"" is of interest to you or your allies. I suggest you return to Oribos and consult them.  No need to rush. After all, those held within Torghast are tortured for centuries.  Kindly remember not to tell anyone about our arrangement. Discretion is key between business partners, after all."
8632,"Tracking the Shadows : The quarry has been slain, and my duties fulfilled. The tirnenn are more than capable of defending their home from the lesser devourers. Nature will take its course.  I will report back to Lord Herne and meet you at the Heart of the Forest. There we shall see what I will be hunting next."
8633,"A Defector's Request : <Unrolling the scroll, you can make out that it's a coded arms requisition from the Maldraxxi of Death's End to their venthyr allies... all servants of the Jailer.  Surely someone among the Death's Advance in Korthia will be able to help you fully break the code and learn exactly what they were planning.>"
8634,"The Eye of the Jailer : <The air around you stands still. A chill of domination suffuses your being. You hear a voice.>  Yes... I remember you...  Do you think that because you evaded my grasp once, that I would let it happen again?  No. The Maw answers to me. All that befalls you here will be because I willed it so.  Death comes for you, mortal. Everywhere you go, my eye is upon you."
8635,"Wounded Memories : The arrival of Uther's wounded soul was the impetus for many events that led us to our current struggles.  Devos's broken trust. Her involvement with Helya. The rise of the Forsworn.  Bastion needs to change, but we struggle to find a solution.  Perhaps this soul fragment will provide valuable insight."
8636,"The Grand Reception : <name>, you have aided the kyrian in the most trying of times. Your devotion to our cause has helped usher in a new beginning for all of us.  We would be honored if you would join us for a gathering prior to the ceremony. Many members of our covenant wish to express their appreciation for all you have done.  This is a day of great joy. I am so pleased that you are here to witness it!"
8637,"Pursuit of Justice : Draka stands ready to unleash the power of the Zerekriss upon Gharmal. We need only buy her time to focus its weapon.  What we do now, we do for all of us. Bastion and Maldraxxus have both lost many to these fiends.  He will not be defeated easily, but united our forces will finally bring him to justice!"
8638,Accusatory Missive : We have received word from Revendreth. It seems that Maldraxxi conspirators have been found skulking within their realm.  An emissary from Sinfall wishes to discuss the anima reserves we discovered.   Join me. We depart immediately.
8639,
8640,"The Cycle of Anima: Drought Conditions : In days past, keeping a forge burning was a trivial task. The anima extractors could run constantly without ever running dry.  Now, even turning an extractor on is a risk. Etherwyrms, without the anima streams to feed on, are attracted to any source of anima. They are a frequent nuisance.  I am going to ask that you risk their attentions. Activate the extractor and guard it until it can accumulate what little anima remains.  Bring me the product it collects. Let us hope it is enough."
8641,"Supplies from the Court of Harvesters : Your assistance to our cause has not gone unnoticed. More and more venthyr across the realm bind themselves to the Court of Harvesters instead of the Master.   As a result, we have collection of resources you may find useful, plundered from Sire Denathrius' most devoted followers. They are waiting for you with me in Darkhaven."
8642,"Blind Loyalty : The path forward for the kyrian is clear to me now.  First we will speak with Nikolon. I urge you to stay and listen.  Afterward, we must return to Elysian Hold.  There I will request an audience with the Archon, and I need you all by my side as I do so."
8643,"Rodent Removal : <The weapon buzzes with a dark, static energy. Whatever this Mawsworn was testing, it appears to have been somewhat successful on the nearby rodents.  Further investigation may yield additional information.>"
8644,"WANTED: Aggregate of Doom : Attention all workers:   We got ourselves a problem down in the thicket.   A golem is trekking through the worksite, causing all sorts of trouble.   Grab a rock and get to throwin'. The dredger that takes it out gets the rest of the day off.   - Foreman Scug"
8645,Phantasmagoria : <The strange mote of otherworldly energy glows with an erratic rhythm.   Ve'nari may find it of interest.>
8646,
8647,"The Soul Contact : Your reputation precedes you, Maw Walker... braving the Maw and bringing Baron Mograine back in one piece...  That was most impressive!  With our dire shortage of souls, we'll need you to do that again. Bring us more willing souls so we can restore this sanctum's power!  Seek out the broker who aided you before and ask if she will do so again. You may need her."
8648,"The Forsworn Onslaught : Loyalty's betrayal shall not go unnoticed.  But while the Paragons defend the city proper, it is up to us to defend Elysian Hold.  I am very wounded... but I will hold strong. Pelagos and I will protect the survivors. You must aid in pushing back this assault!"
8649,"Stay Scrappy : I can rebuild this colossus's core systems, but a few things are beyond repair. Thankfully there were enough centurions present here that I believe we can improvise.  Replacements are in order!  I require an Anima Conflux to charge its systems, some Eternity Plating to protect its core, and an Archonic Resonator to make it go boom!  I'll take care of the rest. Quickly, now!"
8650,
8651,Report to Moonberry : You have chosen well.  The Night Fae fill a critical role in the eternal cycle of nature spirits. The balance of many worlds depends on their work.  Speak with Lady Moonberry and begin your future with your covenant.
8652,Tubbins's Tea : Theotar teach Tubbins special tea that make Light go away!  Tubbins good tea maker!  Watch Tubbins make Theotar feel good!  Then Tubbins feel good!
8653,Acquisition: Blazing Ingots : <The runesmiths have imbued this ingot with an enchantment that causes it to burn with inextinguishable flames.   It is likely that this metal is used to empower the Mawsworn protectors of Zovaal's Cauldron.   Bringing some samples of this ore to Ve'nari could aid her attempts at unlocking the Jailer's secrets.>
8654,
8655,"The Hills Have Eyes : The other houses have yet to launch a full scale assault, but do not mistake their cowardice for incompetence.  Any tactician worth their weight in maldracite knows the value of espionage. I suspect that the agents of our foes skulk within our own ranks as we speak.  Take one of my hounds. It will know our enemies by their scent. Once the pests have been discovered, exterminate them."
8656,"Strengthening the Bond : I know how you feel... and what you have endured for the sake of your world.   You now know of my own triumphs and tragedies as well.  Our bond will grow stronger over time. But for now, let us see what it has granted us.  Ardenweald has needs of us. We must do everything in our power to save it."
8657,"Building the Base : The Crest is almost complete.  I give you the honor of the final touch.  You have done much. Please, take Phaestus and give the final blow!"
8658,"The Key to Rebuilding : If we plan to revive the estate, we'll first need the keys!  When Theotar was exiled to the Ember Ward, he lost all titles and property, meaning that the estate fell into the hands of another aristocrat.   The new owner is a mystery to me, but household staff almost always carry keys on them as they do their business within the Old Gate.   Recover the key and we'll be on our way to rebuilding the manor."
8659,Land of Opportunity : <The grandmaster's voice rings out over the roaring crowd.>  This is it! The final event of the tournament!  These two Maldraxxi gladiators have cut down challenger after challenger. Now the only thing left...  Is for one to slay the other!
8660,"The Work of One's Hands : Too long have my hands been idle!  <Forgelite Sophone smiles warmly at you.>  You cannot know what this means to me, but I might be able to show you. For your aid in restoring my forge, please allow me to craft you a piece of armor.  It will not be an extravagant affair, but through good works we grow to know ourselves better.  I will need your aid once more. Sika and I will guide you on the specifics. All you need to do is listen and do as instructed.  What do you say?"
8661,No Crate Unturned : That explosion will likely bring onlookers from the House of Rituals. We must act quickly.  Search through the debris for anything that looks out of the ordinary. It is likely that Kel'Thuzad's mystery reagent won't be hard to spot.
8662,"Visions of the Dreamer: The Betrayal : I sense that in the spirit's vision, she struggles with the memory of a betrayal that is truly profound.   Someone as close to her as a brother, turned to an enemy.  Go to the second Dreamshrine in the Basin, and help vanquish the pain of this nightmare."
8663,"Directing Dedication : The five temples of Bastion have stood strong since its very creation. The idea of rededicating one has never been broached before, and will no doubt require a significant amount of anima.  Underneath this temple are stores of anima we rationed for the drought. Now that anima is returning, we can use these reserves for our purposes.  You will need to use channelers and collectors throughout the grounds to redirect anima to the top. That should give me the power I need."
8664,"Manifesting Power : As you know, shedding our memories of life can result in dangerous creatures known as manifestations. They have increased in number and strength as of late, but I believe we can find use for them yet.  Manifestations carry great power within them--power we may purify and use in our own creations at the forge here. In making something positive out of such negativity, we do a noble act of service.  Simply eliminate any you come across, and collect their essence. That is all."
8665,"Re-Introductions : Though you have chosen your path, the fate of the Shadowlands has yet to be determined.  The power of the Banished One grows. It falls to you, and others of your kind, to thwart him.  The Arbiter's Honored Voice, Tal-Inara, will aid you in choosing a covenant. Bolstering their strength offers our best chance at victory.  Let the Purpose guide you, <name>. Always."
8666,"My Way or the Hyphae : <An old, booming voice fills your mind.>  Hmph. More are coming.  I would rather not lose more of myself, and I don't want you to think I'm not appreciative of the work you and Cort here have done.  How about you take a ride on the rings and give those oafs a good thrashing? We'll teach them not to mess with Marasmius and his fae rings!"
8667,"Their Last Line of Defense : Those sneaky Drust are protecting Gorak Zhar with their evil magic!  I can sense several foul runes that are scattered across Darkreach. If you destroy them, we can easily shatter the barrier around that nasty Gorak Zhar.  Hurry! I will meet you inside the enemy camp."
8668,"The Curator : I tasked the Curator with reacquiring the Medallion of Avarice.  However, since her return from the Maw, her mind has become... a bit chaotic. Do be kind, will you?    I ask that you lend her assistance in her search. She is at the Crypt of the Forgotten."
8669,"Missing Stone Fiend : You or I could wield these sinstones directly, but I much prefer to use stone fiends for such tasks.  Exceptional results, no personal risk.  Unfortunately, my stone fiend did not return from its last errand.  Speak with Cryptkeeper Kassir in the archives above. He is loyal to the Accuser and will loan us his stone fiend."
8670,
8671,"RSVP: Grandmaster Vole : I'm busy, so I'll get right to the point.   The only way I'm going is if you pay me enough coin to make it worth my while or you amuse me.   As interesting and enjoyable as the Ember Court may be, I lose money every time I am away from here. That said, I do love a good slaughter.  So, coin or deaths. Take your pick."
8672,
8673,"Queen of the Underground : You tracked the massive gorm here to her den, and we've found Master Sha'lor.  Perhaps not entirely unscathed, but he lives. That is enough.  One last task remains. Let us end this."
8674,Ritual of Purification : I have finished making preparations for the ritual. The moment of truth has come.  The Drust fetish that Ulfar gave you will channel the ritual's power into Gweyir. It should counteract the curse that imprisons her mind.   This will not be pleasant. It may not even work. But this is the only chance we have to free her.
8675,Trouble on the Western Front : Alexandros and our Maldraxxi allies need reinforcement at the western gate on the Margrave's opposite flank. They are barely holding on!  Our forces will reinforce our position here and push forward towards Gharmal. We must make haste to Mograine--without both flanks we cannot hope to achieve victory.
8676,"The Endless Forest : Well, that's all I have for you! Whew! You've been on a whirlwind tour of things around here, haven't you? Up and down and slantways and even into the Maw! Your head must be practically spinning.  <Flutterby giggles.>  You should check in with Lady Moonberry and let her know your training is complete!  She probably won't quiz you on what you've learned.  Probably."
8677,"Stolen Korthian Supplies : <These supplies are marked with the seal of the Death's Advance, stolen from the Rift without being noticed.  Duchess Mynx in Keeper's Respite would be very grateful to have this returned.>"
8678,"Sanctum Improvements : Your will to succeed is strong, Maw Walker. With the anima and the souls you have recovered, we can now begin to unlock our sanctum's true potential.  As we acquire more souls and more anima, we can gain even greater power from the Seat of the Primus. Remain relentless in your pursuit, and victory will be ours."
8679,"Claim the Sky : I mourn the loss of my sisters and desire nothing more than to avenge them. Yet I know that I am no match for the witch's magics or her army of Mawsworn.  We must let wisdom guide us and fly from here.   Though I am weak from my captivity, I have the strength to bear you from this place.  Let us go, friend."
8680,"Moving Mirrors : What sort of horrific trap is this? The Light is being reflected directly on her!   Simone's a dear friend of mine! Free her from that thing, please!"
8681,Rat Soul : <The Rat Soul is curious and sociable. The shape of the rat will be yours to call upon.>
8682,"Kindred Spirits : I have come to the realization that you and I are meant to be the most kindred of spirits.   Your enduring nature has enraptured me, and I'm afraid I cannot bear to imagine an afterlife without your beguiling presence.   Let us bind our souls, and forever carry each other in both heart and mind."
8683,"Strengthen the Bond : To bond souls is but the first step. You must now explore its potential.  Just as Pelagos will gain strength from you, so too shall you grow from him. As your bond grows over time you will touch deeper into one another's souls, and so your strength shall increase.   All you must do is place your hand upon the Forge of Bonds to augment your bond. There is no price to pay--the only limitation is your connection to our sacred covenant."
8684,"Grathalax, the Extractor : There are many powerful lieutenants among the Mawsworn, but there is one who is particularly important to the Jailer.  Far beneath the Tremaculum lives the Jailer's prime interrogator, Grathalax. Power is fed to him via conduits throughout the area.  His role is to make the process of anima extraction more efficient. His methods are... unkind.  I believe we would both benefit from the end of his existence."
8685,"Ascension Calling: Mikanikos : <While this scroll mimics Kleia's invitation to the Path of Ascension, it is very clearly written in Sika's hand.  It details an invitation for Mikanikos to participate in the Path, along with Bron.  Perhaps you should bring this to Mikanikos.>"
8686,"Understanding the Shadowlands : As I sat upon the Frozen Throne all those years, <name>, I could peer into the Shadowlands. Brief glimpses, clouded and uncertain. Sights both wondrous and terrible.  We must work together to make sense of what has happened. To prevent the Maw from consuming all of reality.  Whatever Sylvanas and the Jailer want, we must stop them. But we cannot do so alone.  Perhaps Tal-Inara can put us on the path to find answers."
8687,Anima Instincts : Voras is clearly content to roam the Elder Stand. We will need a way to lure it to us once we are ready to fight.  Did you notice the wildseeds in the clearing where we spotted it? Voras must be feasting on the concentrated anima contained within them.  There should still be some expended wildseeds from before the drought in the Gormhive. Let us create bait too tempting for Voras to ignore.
8688,"The Afflictor's Key : Sylvanas thinks us broken. She believes she has already won.  We will show her how mistaken she is.  First, I will need your help. The bonds that hold me are impossibly strong. We will need the key to free me of them.  My... imprisonment here has been overseen by a creature they call the Afflictor. The key is likely in its possession."
8689,"Runestone Roundup : Stone is a rare material in Ardenweald. Yet, I've heard tales that those who were masked by the Drust have small stones upon them.  I'd like you to retrieve some of these stones for the Wild Hunt, so that we may better understand their link to our enemy. Face the masked and collect the stones from their deceased forms and I'll compensate you for your efforts.  It's a gruesome task, but one that must be done."
